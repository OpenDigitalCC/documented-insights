Primary stakeholders (support)
: EU Citizens (106), Companies (37), NGOs (14)

Core arguments (support)
: The Public Product Organization model directly addresses many of the barriers identified by the Commission, providing a sustainable framework for public organizations and their vendors to collaboratively develop, maintain, and govern shared open-source solutions.; EU can play a crucial role in enabling municipalities to rely on interoperable, secure, and sustainable digital public infrastructure by creating an EU-wide procurement framework that favors open source.
