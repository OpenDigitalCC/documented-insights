Feedback for the European Commission initiative âTowards European open digital
ecosystemsâ

Introduction
I appreciate that the European Comission is taking action on this important issue.

I am an engineer in the IT industry, and I specialize in Cloud Technologies, Developer
Platforms, and Open-Source. As an IT consultant, I have built cloud infrastructure for many
public sector and private sector organizations, and I have deep insight into the technical
decisions made as a consumer of cloud services.

I also have a somewhat unique geopolitical perspective, having been born and raised in the US
and having worked in the IT industry in both the US and Sweden.

For transparency, I will mention that I am employed by a company that provides EU cloud
hosting services and open source office software. However, my comments here have not been
coordinated with my employer. My comments here are entirely my own personal opinions and
do not represent the views of my employer in any way.

Cloud hosting
One of the most expensive crises facing the EUâs digital sovereignty is the EUâs dependence on
US cloud hosting services. Europe must build a strong market for domestic cloud hosting as
soon as possible, along with concrete incentives in order for EU organizations to be able to
begin de-risking their hosting situation.

The bare minimum for a hosting provider to be able to host IT services is a foundation of
compute and data storage. Specifically, hosting providers should provide the capability to run
Linux and Windows VMs, and managed Kubernetes clusters; They should also provide storage
in the form of local SSDs, POSIX network file storage, and S3-compatible object storage. This is
the bare minimum that an IT team will need to be able to run the majority of their IT systems
without major re-engineering, and the ECâs technical requirements for competent EU cloud
providers should require capabilities similar to this.

One of the main challenges that EU cloud providers face is the sheer market dominance and
scale of US cloud providers. They are able to offer strong incentives to new customers such as
dedicated support staff and special discounts. These new customers invest large amounts of
engineering time into joining the cloud provider, and then they are unable to switch to other
cloud providers without investing a similar amount of engineering time again. EU cloud
providers must outcompete US cloud providers by a large margin in order for companies to
break out of this lock-in effect.

US cloud providers are also often intentionally designed to be incompatible with other cloud
vendors, making it more difficult to migrate to another cloud vendor in the future. There are a
large amount of âproprietary cloud servicesâ, such as proprietary database formats, proprietary
programming languages and scripting languages, and proprietary computing systems.Â§ Multi-
cloud technology should be incentivized, to reduce the market advantage and vendor lock-in of
US cloud vendors. Kubernetes is an example of a multi-cloud technology that is extremely
portable and offers a universal API that is compatible with virtually every cloud vendor in the
industry.

There are at least two kinds of cloud hosting products that are hard to replace with open-source
solutions and are currently dominated by cloud monopolies, these two products are DDOS
protection and captcha. There are EU and/or open source alternatives for DDOS protection and
captcha, but Cloudflare and Google are extremely dominant in those markets. These are not
difficult products to engineer, but they are loss-leader services and there needs to be an EU
alternative that can compete with the US competitors offering these services below-cost. One
competitive advantage that an EU competitor could offer over Cloudflare and Google would be
improved user privacy, as Cloudflare and Google are considered to be unreliable among digital
privacy advocates. There should be some consideration in developing one or more EU
alternatives in DDOS protection and captcha.

In general, there are many viable EU vendors in the cloud space, but they need more scale to
be able to compete with the scale and lock-in effect of the big 3 cloud vendors.

Cloud office software
The US companies Google and Microsoft have a duopoly on cloud office software. Almost all
levels of society are dependent on Google or Microsoft for their daily operations, from non-profit
organizations, to critical businesses, to schools, to state governments and EU bodies. This
poses a severe, immediate sovereignty risk, as we have seen with US sanctions being used to
shut off access to Outlook and Github around the world, and most alarmingly the use of
sanctions to shut off the ICCâs access to their own Outlook account.

Beyond usersâ existing familiarity with the software, one of the competitive advantages that
Google and Microsoft enjoy when organizations are shopping for office software is that they
each are a single vendor that provides email, calendar, drive storage, online forms, text chat
channels, video call, and user directory. Users can choose a single provider without worrying
about multiple contracts, billing arrangements, or technical integration. Once using Google or
Microsoft for cloud office software, it is difficult to switch to another vendor, as there can be
important archives for email, calendar, chat, and project tracking that are difficult/impossible to
migrate.

There are many EU and open source alternatives to Google and Microsoft that are very
competitive from a software perspective, but in order for these vendors to be competive, they
need to be able to compete as a complete package with the office bundles offered by Google
and Microsoft. These vendors need to be able to offer a one-stop shop with easy data migration,
and they need marketing and reputation to get private organizations to start considering them
over the standard Google and Microsoft options. User familiarity and data migration are pain
points that should be solved.
In the public sector and critical industries, mere market incentives likely are not proportionate to
the risk to EU interests. Using Google or Microsoft should not be acceptable for public sector
and critical industries, due to severe GDPR and national security issues. There must be plans to
migrate away from Google and Microsoft as soon as possible for all public sector and critical
industries, along with investment where needed to reduce friction.

Desktop OS
The Desktop OS market is shifting, and there is already strong competition to Apple and
Microsoft from Linux. Linux has emerged as a competitive alternative to Windows due to web
applications, compatibility tools, and Linux improvements. The main challenges to further Linux
adoption are the incumbency of Windows, not any major technical or competitive limitations.

There are already a meaningful amount of users switching from Windows to Linux, which has
been accelerated by recent improvement in Linux, and the discontinuation of Windows 10.
Users have a good incentive to switch to Linux due to its better user experience for general
usage, and it often has better programming tools for engineers.

However, at the workplace, there is very little reason for organizations to switch from Windows
to Linux. There are no cost or infrastructural reasons for organizations to switch, and it can be
harder for IT departments to manage fleets of Linux laptops, and tools may be lacking. Some IT
security tools required by some industries may not be available for Desktop Linux. Many IT
technicians often only have Windows experience, and re-training them for Linux is a large
career barrier that can be time-consuming and stressful. One policy solution to encourage the
migration away from US-controlled Windows software would be subsidizing IT companies that
provide managed fleets of Linux laptops for businesses. Such a policy would give a direct
financial incentive for companies to begin using Desktop Linux, directly reduce businessesâ IT
costs, and help to grow an ecosystem around enterprise use of Desktop Linux.

Dismantling Windowsâ incumbent advantage for private users still remains challenging. Usersâ
experience using Desktop Linux in the workspace may be beneficial to increase familiarity with
Linux. Policy options such as requiring computer hardware sold in the EU to have an option to
come with Linux pre-installed would also help make Linux more accessible. One challenge with
such a policy though is that there is little to no Linux support for Apple and Qualcomm
computers.

Overall, Linux is well-positioned to replace Windows in the EU, but some light incentives for
users and organizations to switch would help accelerate the process.

Software supply chain
One risk to the EU, even in areas of IT dominated by EU-based and open-source software, is
the risk to the EUâs software supply chain. Today, the majority of software downloads come
from US-based servers. Mobile apps on iOS and Android are almost universally downloaded
from Apple and Googleâs app stores. Software updates and security updates for Windows and
MacOS come from US servers. In the IT infrastructure space, nearly all applications are
distributed as OCI Docker images. The US website, Docker Hub, is by far the largest repository
for Docker images.

Even if a piece of software is open source and developed in the EU, often that software is
distributed through US servers, and/or requires software downloaded from US servers to be
compiled. This is a major concern for software supply-chain security, as state actors could
compel operators of these servers to inject malware or backdoors.

There is also a large risk that if these software downloads were to stop working, a large amount
of IT infrastructure would stop working with it, and a large amount of consumer devices would
no longer receive updates. An extended Docker Hub outage would likely cause major IT
outages in all sectors of the economy.

It is likely possible to resolve these software supply-chain issues with regulation. The exact type
software supply chain at risk varies depending on the kind of software, and the end-user for the
software. Regulation should be considered to mitigate these risks on a per-technology basis.

Smartphones
Google and Apple have a duopoly on phone and tablet OSes. Android has an open-source
version called AOSP, but virtually all Android apps are distributed through the Google Play
store. Furthermore, virtually all Android apps require the use of Google Play Services to run, or
at least a reverse-engineered reimplementation of it, such as MicroG.

There are currently major GDPR and security concerns with Google Play Services. All
notifications are sent through Googleâs servers, who can access the full text of all notifications,
unencrypted. Additionally, Google often records the GPS location of android phones without
usersâ consent.

There have been some recent improvements in Linux phones as an alternative to Android and
iOS, but Linux phones are not compatible with existing apps. There is an android compatibility
layer called Waydroid, but it is still not compatible with many existing Android apps because
they require Google Play Services. Many banking apps also use Google Play Integrity for
security checks of the underlying hardware and OS.

Solutions to solve the lack of digital sovereignty in the smartphone market should focus on
making AOSP more viable for consumers. All smartphones sold in the EU should allow users to
install AOSP or other open-source software on them, and all Android apps in the EU market
should be available on alternative EU-based app stores and be compatible with MicroG or
another application runtime. The EU should also promote development of Linux phones as an
alternative to AOSP, and the EU should help remove the barriers that prevent Android apps
from running through compatibility layers like Waydroid on Linux phones.

eIDAS in Sweden and BankID
Finally, I want to bring some light to a major digital sovereignty issue in Sweden. In Sweden,
digital identification, including eIDAS, is largely controlled by Finansiell ID-Teknik BID AB
(âBankIDâ), which has a near complete monopoly on digital identification. There are little to no
alternatives for important digital tasks such as filing taxes, making secure payments under
PSD2 rules, using online banking, and using digital mailboxes. This online consultation page
only supports Freja and BankID for identification in Sweden. On many other online services,
only BankID is supported for identification.

BankID is a private company jointly owned by the banking industry, and as such they donât
seem to have a requirement to make their societally-critical service accessible to all Swedes.
The problem with this is that BankID has security requirements that requires a smartphone that
uses software controlled by the US. Either a iOS smartphone or an Android smartphone is
needed to use BankID, and it is not possible to use an open-source or EU-based alternative. It
is not possible to use the open-source AOSP version of android, as the application is only
available on the Google Play app store, and for security reasons, requires Googleâs proprietary
software programs, Google Play Services and Google Play Integrity.

There must be remedies to require critical sectors to remove their digital sovereignty risks. It is
not possible for Europe to de-risk from non-EU IT systems when some critical actors refuse to
allow de-risking. Issues like this means that digitalization can often increase digital sovereignty
risks, instead of reducing them. If the EU successfully replaces US credit card payment
networks with an ECB or national payment system, but that system still depends on proprietary
US software like Android, we have not significantly reduced the external vulnerability risk of our
payment systems. Digitalization half-measures wonât solve digital sovereignty.

Conclusion
I hope that I have been able to provide some insight and urgency on the state of the IT industry
and open-sourceâs role in it. Again, I appreciate that the European Commission is taking action
on this important issue, and as an IT engineer, I look forward to being part of the IT industryâs
efforts to improve the situation.
