Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems
Introduction
This is a (very rough) response to the call for evidence by the European Commis-
sion entitled âTowards European open digital ecosystemsâ. I was very pleased
to hear that the EU is planning on embracing open source software, and I have
been pleased with some of their previous initiatives. This is a bit of a ramble,
but I hope this communicates the value of open source to me as a user, how it
enables me to teach and where it can protect my data from exploitation, and
where it falls short. Iâve tried to keep a bit of a structure, though there will be
some bleed between sections.

TLDR:
Reasons why open source should be focused on:
   â¢ Digital sovereignty from not being beholden to private companies governed
     by foreign nations - protects institutions that uphold international law
   â¢ Public goods from software being freely available and adaptable - easy to
     audit and submit changes (also a potential problem with unsavy maintain-
     ers)
   â¢ Producing higher quality software
   â¢ Reducing technological and vendor lock-in - gives more choice to the user
     if their needs are not being met

Digital Sovereignty in Software and its Cross-Border Bene-
fits
Itâs common knowledge that American big tech companies have control of the
cloud infrastructure service provider market. The top four of Wikipediaâs list
of largest technology companies by revenue all have the USA as the country
of origin. Amazonâs subsidiary AWS has almost a 30% market share in Q3
2025[1], which is closely followed by Microsoftâs Azure service at 20%. While
these companies have all been subjected to pressures from the US government
to advance their political agenda, the case that comes to mind is Microsoftâs
Outlookâs âdisconnectâ of the email address of Karim Khan, the Prosecutor of
the ICC. This was after an executive order by the US President claimed the ICC
had âengaged in illegitimate and baseless actionsâ following their investigation
into the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza.[2]
Itâs my opinion that itâs untenable for international conglomerates to impede
bringing war criminals to justice to avoid retaliation from the governments, and
itâs in the worldâs interest to keep the ICC and similar organisations independent
from the whims of one or a few select countries, and in particular countries that
are under scrutiny of those organisations.
In other ways, Alphabetâs Google has campaigned relentlessly against digital

                                        1
privacy, with Google Street View, scanning of usersâ mail in Gmail, and non-
compliance with information requests by European governments. I think these
âbusiness strategiesâ are unsustainable and are antithetical to the world I want
to live in where people have freedom from constant surveillance. The modern
technology industry is closing in on consumers with recent moves to dynamic
pricing based on the processing of personal messages (recent Gmail announcement
about AI product Gemini being given access to âprivateâ mail).
Encouraging a shift to non-Big-Tech, free and open source software would do
more than just protect the privacy, civil and other rights of people. My country
is not a member of the European Union, but I am an infrequent contributor
and full-time user of free and open source software. Strengthening the EUâs
open source sector and sustainable contributions to open-source communities
will improve the services for people worldwide, serving as a public good for which
investment will have benefits in the short and long term. Short term because
of removing bargaining power from global economic hegemons that would use
existing technical investment in technologies to unduly influence decisions, and
long term to build a population that has the skills to maximise potential benefit
that can be obtained through the use of technology.
I periodically volunteer to teach children in primary schools in my community
how to code, and the value of being able to decompose problems into steps
that can be tackled individually by computers. The single most important
tool Iâve used in this are BBC Micro:Bits, as they make computers much more
approachable as a concept as opposed to controlling a sealed plastic or metal
box. The Micro:Bit ecosystem is supported by an open source tech stack which
includes MicroPython and Javascript, and makecode.microbit.org as a cloud-
based ide which has virtually no obstacles to use, with (reasonably) affordable
hardware prices. Note that makecode is developed by Microsoft, but if the
project were to be discontinued, it would be easier to switch to alternate IDE,
because of the large number of open-source software with equivalent functionality.
In a case like this, open hardware and software makes it easy for young learners
to become familiar with practical engineering, without being introduced to a
walled garden.
Given the large amount of open-source contributions by private companies, itâs
important to be pragmatic about open-source development, and I donât intend
to be ungrateful for the positives that the capital gained harvesting private
information without consent has produced. Statistics from the 6.10 kernel[3]
show that by change-sets, 10 companies, led by Intel, Google and RedHat, were
the most active employers of that release. It would be easy to dismiss this as self-
serving, and to be fair, companies wouldnât contribute to the Linux kernel unless
it was in their business interests. I think itâs noteworthy that these ruthlessly
profit-focused companies can justify spending large salaries on programmers
to an end that their competitors and end consumers will undeniably benefit
from, and I think that contributions from contributors with the security of
government backing will similarly benefit other parts of that government but

                                         2
also people worldwide. This thinking has already been employed as detailed in
the European Commissionâs Open Source Software Strategy (2020-2023)[4], and
the Interoperable Europe Act[5].
Despite these good contributions to the open-source ecosystem, there are some
companies who are actively hostile (understandably) to the adoption of open
source technologies. An example of this is Microsoft attempting to threaten the
UK government[6] after plans to move to Open Document Format instead of
Microsoftâs proprietary .doc and .docx formats. This is similar to when the Mu-
nich government reversed an almost-complete migration to a Linux distribution
called LiMux[7], following Microsoft moving their German headquarters bach to
Munich from UnterschleiÃheim.

Interoperability and the adoption and maintenance of open
source code
âEnshittificationâ, coined by Cory Doctorow, is a very popular phrase as of late.
From my understanding, it describes the general trend of Big Tech companies
reducing the quality of their services with the goal of extracting more revenue
from existing users. Companies are incentivised to gain users to increase their
revenue. Common revenue models include recruiting paying customers with a
one-time license or subscription fee, showing them ads or selling their data or
inferred personal data. Maybe these companies make a good product that has
compatibility with what systems people already use, with the intent of extracting
revenue later on. Some users may be more privacy conscious, and may decide
to take their business elsewhere. Increasing revenue in ways that users may
disagree with will inevitably lose some customers, but these companies want to
maximise profits. In some cases, they make it harder for customers to leave.
Android OS, is the most widely used OS in the world. Google made Android OS
available free to manufacturers, arranged strategic partnerships and made use
of deep integration with existing services like Gmail to make the devices more
appealing than Appleâs ecosystem. The current day market-share is a result of
planned and considered steps over a long period of time backed up by a very
large amount of investor funding and advertising revenue. This massive market
adoption has enabled Google to have free-range access of user data without their
knowledge and consent[8]. This is an example of adoption of open source that,
in my opinion, has harmed the privacy and other rights of users.
To compare with a project with a very different origin story, the VLC Media
Player âoriginated as a French academic project in 1996â[9]. Starting small in
scope, with the aim of streaming video across a university, it was made available
under the GNU GPLv2 free software license. This enabled development from
contributors across the world, helped by its modular software architecture that
allows for the easy integration of new features. At the time of writing, VLC has
900 million downloads on software distribution site Sourceforge, and 66 million
downloads directly from the website. VLC Media Player asks the user if theyâd

                                       3
like to opt-in to telemetry, for usage statistics and/or crash reports.
Apache is a FOSS web-server that was based off code enhancements of an early
web-server created by the NCSA at the University of Illinois. The Apache
Foundation, who also created the Apache Software license that along with the
GNU GPL licenses has allowed people to collectively pool effort to create high
quality software remotely. Nowadays, Apache serves over 17% of the 1 million
busiest websites.
In my opinion, the number one requirement for open-source code to be widely
adopted is interoperability. Like Google focused on interoperability between
its own products to make Android more convenient to use compared to other
offerings, and VLC media player giving developers the tools to easily integrate
new codecs, interoperability allows for a broad appeal across a userbase because
it can cater to a large subset of needs. Being able to export data from a program
into a data exchange format is ideal, as this omits the need for converter programs.
For example, the OpenDocument Format for office applications, instead of using
e.g. Word/Powerpoint formats. By having a well-defined and widely-adopted
document format, users will get consistent results when displaying documents
using different programs including Calligra Suite, LibreOffice and OpenOffice.
The use of these open standards should be enforced in public organisations too.
The point of Google adding all their services wasnât really for the convenience
of the end user, it was to encourage further reliance on services, so having
interoperable data formats and easy ways to generate, convert and move them
will give users more options when choosing software to suit their needs.
The then Vice President of Open Systems and Linux at IBM Bob Sutor an-
nounced[10] in 2010 that IBM was moving to Mozilla Firefox as a default browser
for all its employees. His reasoning sums up the benefits of the âJewel of Open
Sourceâ[11]. Abridged, these are:
   â¢ Interoperability via open standards
   â¢ Security, with source-availability making it easy to audit
   â¢ Extensibility through customisation
   â¢ Project managed by a development community instead of a corporate
     entity

Sustainable Contributions and Cybersecurity
I donât think thereâs a widely used FOSS project that doesnât use some kind
of version control; common ones are SVN, Mercurial and the most popular,
Git. At the moment, a large number of open source projects are hosted on
Github, which is owned by a subsidiary of Microsoft. Github has reported having
~100000000 users in 2023, which makes it the largest host of open source code
in the world. Aside from previous issues with Microsoft mentioned above, they
have recently been moving all of Githubâs infrastructure to their cloud-based
Azure[12], increasing the possibility of lock-in for CI/CD. There are alternatives
such as Bitbucket, owned by Atlassian, which is an American-Australian software

                                         4
company, Gitlab, owned by Gitlab Inc. which is an American Company. Thereâs
also SourceForge and AWS CodeCommit. You might notice that all of these
are provided by American-based companies. One EU-based answer to this is
Codeberg, which provides git hosting as a publicly-available instance of the free
and open source software Forgejo (which is under the custody of Codeberg),
along with static site hosting. Supporting and promoting an alternate git hosting
service will give an EU sovereign platform for hosting code that is not subject
to Microsoft control. Because Git is a distributed version control system at its
heart, and git repository hosting must be interoperable by design, there will be
less barriers for users to migrate their projects over.
Currently, many open source projects are funded and hosted in part by academic
organisations. Last year in the USA, higher-education institutions including
colleges/universities were subjected to research funding cuts from the US federal
government. These sweeping cuts included Oregon State University. When under
pressure to cut programs, one of the ones they chose was their Open Source
Labs[13]. OSL has been running for many years providing hosting services
for projects I have mentioned so far, including Mozilla Firefox, the Apache
Software Foundation, the Linux Kernel, and infrastructure for projects that
I use now including Gentoo Linux and Fedora. Thankfully, after coverage in
industry news sources, and sharing of the situation across popular user forums,
funding for OSL has been stabilised, with plans for future sustainable operation
in part through individual contributions and industry outreach[14]. This is an
example of the value public infrastructure brings to individuals and companies.
While this example is across the Atlantic Ocean, there are hundreds of academic
institutions that provide hosting services for free and open source projects now,
like Debian package manager mirrors among many examples, and stable funding
for university FOSS software initiatives will allow projects to focus limited
contributor and financing resources into improving their respective projects.
At the most recent Chaos Communication Congress (39CC), a live demonstration
showing attacker-constructed gpg key files could trick the user into unintentionally
signing a file. Two years ago, a vulnerability in XZ-Utils was caught by chance
by a user who noticed ssh was consuming slightly more resources. This was in a
software package that would have been used by software installed and used on
hundreds of millions of devices.
These are two high-profile examples, but it shows that the volunteer and employed
contributors who write the code are flawed like all programmers, and given the
number of internet facing and consumer devices using open source software,
just as much caution should be paid to security as a company would their
product (assuming that they do not lean on security through obscurity in their
techniques). This is where the EU might consider funding security researchers
to audit critical software and suggest fixes.
