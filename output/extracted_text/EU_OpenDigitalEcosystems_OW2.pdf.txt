Introduction â by OW2, a French open source foundation (ow2.org).
OW2, as a EU-originated independent non-profit open source association based in France, would
like to contribute by focusing on a few key points â placing emphasis on what can be done for:

- Public procurement, research, software and data produced by administrations, and mass market
regulations.
- Open, free, public standards.
- Edge to cloud (from smartphone to infrastructure) to be massively migrated to FOSS (Free / Open
Source Software).
- Support to open digital commons by contributing to, using, backing and funding them.
- Support to the ecosystem, mostly small actors who develop 80%+ of FOSS dependencies, but also
European FOSS foundations, by adequate grant schemes or tax exemptions.
- Generalizing FOSS in education.

Concerning FOSS itself, we insist on its importance for technical independence:
- Lots of successful European startups and technologies have been purchased by foreign actors:
being a local company is not enough to secure anything, we need the technology to be open.
- FOSS protects against lock-in by a single actor, be it foreign or European â then excessive price
increases, customer roadmap control, monopolies, etc.
- Cybersecurity requires the code and design to be auditable, and the ability to fix critical breaches
quickly. Only FOSS allows it.

More details follow - and include a few examples, mostly from France where OW2 has its
headquarters. Note what we say about FOSS can be mostly generalized to open models (open
hardware, data, standards, education, arts, etc.).

Public money â public code
Use FOSS
- Massively use and deploy FOSS technologies (Linux, collaborative work suites,
videoconferencing, messaging, etc.), including user desktop computers1.
- Make FOSS the default for public procurement, with obligation to motivate publicly other choices.
- Whenever possible, do not develop FOSS technologies that already exist in the ecosystem (reuse
and integrate instead) so not to waste money reinventing the wheel, and to support existing actors2.

Develop / contribute to FOSS
- Require FOSS for all EU-funded projects (Horizon, etc.) and make FOSS the default for academic
research - exceptions requiring to be motivated by âforce majeureâ (defense secrets, health privacy,
etc.).
- Make any software developed by an administration open source, make open data mandatory for
any administration (except specific âforce majeureâ â defense? privacy? - to be duly motivated),
and enforce it3.
- Favor upstream contributions by employees (contributing to the main project on its own forge) to
projects used in their organization, or even to FOSS at large4 .
- Develop OSPOs (Open Source Program Offices) for FOSS governance in administrations.
1   France has an example of this with its âGendarmerie Nationaleâ police force (100.000 desktops + infrastructure on
    Linux and FOSS), and Germany with the recent FOSS migration strategy plan of the Schleswig Holstein state (see
    https://schleswig-holstein.de/open-source).
2   A good example being OpenDesk, the German public collaborative suite - https://www.opendesk.eu/en/about
3   France or Switzerland already have such regulations, but weak enforcement.
4   The French âGendarmerieâ is again a prominent example, but also private organizations like Siemens or the MAIF
    insurance group encourage that.
Mass market FOSS dissemination
- Favor FOSS operating systems on computers sold to consumers (tax exemptions for preinstalled
Linux, legislations to ban forced sales of proprietary pre-installed OSes, etc.). Most EU countries
already have laws to prevent forced sales, but poorly enforce them â preinstalled Windows being
the âstandardâ all over Europe.
- Generalize and promote alternative OSes on smartphones (with similar mechanisms) to break the
Google/Apple monopoly (proprietary app stores / âsecurityâ mechanisms like Play Integrity, etc.)

Standards
- Make standards open, free and public in all sectors â publish them under open licenses.
- Ensure that people who participate in standards elaboration do not carry foreign or specific
business interests (EU-based organizations without foreign dependency, EU citizens, conflicts of
interests like consultancy on standards they participate in or business lock-in based on them, etc.)
- Make standard elaboration processes as open as possible (like IETF RFCs for internet protocols?)

Edge to cloud
Smartphone
- Provide alternative security / integrity services as replacements to Google Play Integrity or similar
closed private control mechanisms5: allow alternate services and authorities - involving EU certified
trust authorities, similar to Certificate Authorities for internet SSL certificates - to assert phones and
apps integrity, so to prevent lock-in, monopolies, and exclusion that constitutes a major risk for the
EU infrastructure6.
- Support alternative OSes (Android forks, Linux, etc.) by porting and supporting any public sector
app on them, and requiring private actors (banks, etc.) to support their apps running on alternate
phones.
- Favor EU-made phones running alternative OSes (Android forks, Linux, etc.) in procurement for
public servants, and promote them globally7.

Cloud/infrastructure
- Take into account long-term availability of support (security patches, etc.), even in case of
international sanctions, in any certification (cybersecurity, etc.) for infrastructure â like cloud
technologies. This would impede âsovereignty washingâ like reselling of âsovereignâ Azure or
Google Cloud technologies by EU operators (many examples in France and Germany).
- Make open source a positive criterion in any cloud or infrastructure technology certification
(cybersecurity, etc.) - particularly for cybersecurity that requires auditable code and an autonomous
quick fixing mechanism of zero-day flaws.
- Deploy all public services on open source cloud and infrastructure software hosted in Europe (or
on-premise).

5   This may require to break the monopoly of Google on Google Play Integrity, etc., like it was done for App Stores:
    but regulations like the DMA make it possible.
6   Currently, we are at risk that critical apps, like banking apps but also National or European IDs for citizens, whose
    checks depend on Google/Apple, be shut down instantly by simply revoking a certificate!
7   Actors like Fairphone with Murena OS, ShiftPhone, Volla, etc. provide open OSes and preinstalled EU-made
    phones.
Digital commons
Use and contribute to open commons
- Stop any official communication on private non-EU social networks (like X, Facebook or
BlueSky): EU citizenâs personal data should not be disclosed to foreign businesses or states in order
to read public information â instead, EU-based social networks (Mastodon, etc.) should be
reinforced by publishing on them and promoting them.
- Massively migrate to EU-based open digital commons: social networks/communication (eg.
Mastodon, Matrix/Element), maps (OpenStreetMap), etc.
- Provide funding mechanisms ala NGI (cascade funding) and/or other kinds of grants with
lightweight application accessible to SMEs, associations and citizens, not only for innovation, but
also to support open commons operations (like server hosting, sysadmins, etc.).
- Contribute to open commons when appropriate (Open Street Map, social networks, forges, etc.),
by in-kind contribution (software development, hosting, research, etc.) or financial support. We
have several examples of such successful contribution schemes in France (IGN National
Geographic Agency, INSEE National Statistics Agency, etc.).
- Do not make any online service dependent on foreign technologies (like Google authentication /
maps / wallet, etc.).

Forges (relocation, federation, export/import, etc.)
- Ensure reversibility for FOSS projects hosted on foreign private forges like Github or Gitlab.com:
export/import, beyond code, of all artefacts (issues, merge requests, CI/CD configurations, etc.).
- Develop forge federation standards / protocols (ActivityPub? Others?).
- Consider EU-hosted non-profit forges as open digital commons, to be supported (see above).

Ecosystem
Individuals / small teams
- Support individuals and small teams who develop open source software or assets (open hardware,
education, etc.) with cascade funding mechanisms ala NGI (easy application, small grants): around
80% of open source software dependencies being developed by individuals.

FOSS foundations
- Make a clear statement of what a âEuropean FOSS foundationâ should be: at least a non-profit
based in EU with open source as a main objective in its bylaws, no dependency on foreign
organizations for management / governance (be it as a subsidiary or funding from abroad, or by
governance like foreign members having a vote majority at the board, directors who are non-EU
citizens, etc.), and no restricted access to selected members (like a club). In this document, this is
what we mean by âEuropean FOSS foundationâ8.
- Provide fiscal exemptions for membership fees or donations to European FOSS foundations, to
citizens and companies.
- Do not allow FOSS foundations or any FOSS actor controlled from outside EU (foreign
dependency / governance / management etc.) to advise the EU on policy, legislation or standards -
or at least register them as foreign lobbies / consider them in conflict of interest.
- Reinforce sovereignty checks (who controls a foundation â according to bylaws, strategic
membership, governance, etc.) to block or restrain access to public funding / grants for foundations
that are not controlled in majority by European stakeholders.

8   As examples, OW2, FSFE, NLnet, Framasoft, Matrix Foundation, APELL or Software Heritage meet such criteria.
Advertising / communication
- Make public bodies and servants participate in FOSS events, be part of FOSS foundations, etc.
- Advertise on public (or even private) sector FOSS involvement and success stories.
- Use FOSS as an incentive to recruit public servants (âemployer brandâ) â this should also be
encouraged in private sector.

Education
Education to and by FOSS
- Generalize the use of FOSS at all levels of education (from children to students) â including
Linux/LibreOffice in schools, FOSS collaborative suites in Universities, FOSS technologies and
platforms in IT education, etc9.
- Give âopen modelâ lectures/courses in schools/universities to explain pupils and students what
open models are (code, hardware, standards, data, arts, education, etc.) and disseminate the FOSS
culture10.
- Generalize open education (books, educational content, courses, etc. covered by open licenses)11.

9  As an example, France runs a National Education project called NIRD, part of its digital commons initiative, to
   install Linux in schools: https://nird.forge.apps.education.fr/.
10 This can be done in cooperation with FOSS foundations: FSFE being exemplary with its âFree software in
   educationâ programme (https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/education/index.en.html).
11 Franceâs National Educationâs commons forge is an attempt at developing that: https://docs.forge.apps.education.fr
