 Response to the EC Open Consultation on the European Open Digital Ecosystems

Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector
The European research software (RS) ecosystem is defined by a tension between high
innovative potential and structural fragility. While the EU possesses a vibrant community of
"researchers who code", formal Research Software Engineer (RSE) societies (e.g., SocRSE,
RSE.de), and powerful foundations through initiatives such as the European Open Science
Cloud (EOSC), it currently lacks the systemic support to maintain software as a strategic asset.
This weakness manifests as a lack of shared quality standards and chronic underfunding for
maintenance, leading to "technical debt" where core infrastructure becomes unstable or
abandoned. This fragmentation forces reliance on non-EU proprietary systems, undermining
the digital sovereignty goals as well as the Open Source Software Strategy.

The added value of open source for the public and private sectors
To address these barriers, it is imperative that research software is framed not merely as a
tool but as a "first-class citizen" of the European Knowledge Economy, an effort spearheaded
by the EOSC EVERSE project. The added value of a robust RS ecosystem lies in securing
Europeâs competitiveness and maximizing the return on public investment. As the Draghi
Report calls for an unprecedented EUR 750â800 billion annual boost in R&D spending, EVERSE
argues that this investment will be wasted if the underlying software is not robust, reusable,
and verifiable. To foster community engagement and ensure long-term maintenance, it is also
important to promote software development under open-source models. Furthermore, high-
quality RS is now a regulatory necessity; under the EU AI Act, software that evolves into "High-
Risk AI" systems must meet stringent legal obligations regarding robustness, cybersecurity,
and data quality. Consequently, establishing a common definition of research software quality
based on the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) principles is essential for both legal
compliance and scientific reproducibility.

Concrete measures and actions that may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda.
Concrete measures to support this sector must transition from aspirational goals to
mandatory implementation across three strategic pillars: sustainability, professionalization,
and standardization. Indeed, having common agreed mechanisms across scientific disciplines
are critical to identify software components essential to research and contributions made by
different stakeholders. Regarding funding, the current reliance on short-term project grants is
incompatible with long-term software stewardship. The EU must implement the Amsterdam
Declaration (ADORE.software) recommendations to fund "software maintenance" distinct
from "innovation". This could involve piloting a structural body, such as a European Research
Software Consortium, to provide guaranteed funding for core software infrastructure that
transcends national boundaries.
Simultaneously, the workforce must be professionalized. The shortage of recognized
Research Software Engineers (RSEs) is a critical bottleneck. To resolve this, institutions and
funders must enforce the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA)
commitments, reforming assessment criteria to reward software contributions and high-
quality code rather than relying solely on publication metrics. This reform should be supported
by capacity-building activities that leverage national and/or European Competence Centers to
provide tailored training and bridge the digital skills gap.

Technology areas that should be prioritised and why. Sectors that could an increased
use of open source lead to increased competitiveness and cyber resilience.
Prioritization should focus on technology areas where dependency poses the highest strategic
risk, such as foundational libraries, middleware, and General Purpose AI models. Securing
these assets is vital for competitiveness in key sectors including healthcare, where RS
underpins the European Health Data Space and personalized medicine, or environmental
science, where robust modelling is critical for the Green Deal. By managing dual-use
technologies with a balanced policy of "as open as possible, as closed as necessary," Europe
can capitalize on its research software capacity to build a resilient, independent ecosystem
that functions as a true European asset while ensuring global impact.

Overview of the EOSC EVERSE project (https://everse.software/)
The EVERSE project aims to create a framework for research software and code excellence,
collaboratively designed and championed by the research communities across five EOSC
Science Clusters and national Research Software Expertise Centres, in pursuit of building a
European network of Research Software Quality and setting the foundations of a future Virtual
Institute for Research Software Excellence.
This framework for research software excellence will incorporate aspects involving
community curation, quality assessment, and good practices for research software. This
collective knowledge will be captured in the Research Software Quality toolkit (RSQKit), a
knowledge base to gather and curate expertise that will contribute to high-quality software and
code across different disciplines.
By embedding the RSQKit and services into the EOSC Science Clusters, EVERSE will
demonstrate improvements in the quality of research software and maximise its reuse, leading
to standardised software development practices and sustainable research software.
Furthermore, EVERSE will drive recognition of software and support career progress for
developers, from researchers who code to RSEs, raising their capacity to guarantee software
quality.
The European network for Research Software Quality aims to cross-fertilise different research
domains, act as a lobbying organisation, and raise awareness of software as a key enabler in
research, with the overall ambition to accelerate research and innovation through improving
the quality of research software and code.
EVERSE ultimate ambition is to contribute towards a cultural change where research software
is recognized as a first-class citizen of the scientific process and the people that contribute to
it are credited for their efforts.
