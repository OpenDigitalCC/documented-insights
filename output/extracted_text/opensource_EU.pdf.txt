Executive Summary
Open-source software offers Europe a realistic, mature, and sovereign alternative to proprietary digital
platforms. The primary obstacle to its broad adoption is not technical capability, but fragmentation:
too many distributions, interfaces, installation methods, and support models prevent open source
from achieving the shared baseline from which proprietary platforms benefit.
This document argues that the European Union can play a decisive enabling role by endorsing and
supporting reference platforms across desktop, education, mobile, and consumer marketsâwithout
eliminating choice or innovation. By establishing common standards for user experience, software
support, education, and installation methods, the EU can significantly lower adoption barriers, reduce
long-term dependency on non-European vendors, and strengthen digital sovereignty.
Early exposure through education, credible open-source mobile platforms, and market-level
availability are essential to ensure that Europeâs future workforce develops transferable digital skills
rather than product-specific dependencies.

Introduction
My name is Steve Caster, and I have been an active Linux user since 1997, when I first worked with
Red Hat Linux 4.0. Between 2002 and 2004, I was professionally employed by a Linux and Open Source
consultancy agency, Digibel, where I supported, deployed, and advised on Linux-based solutions in
professional environments.
Over the years, I have been involved in several Linux User Groups and have accumulated hands-on
experience with a wide range of distributions, including Red Hat, Debian, Slackware, Ubuntu, and their
derivatives. This long-term exposure gives me both a technical and a user-centric perspective on the
strengths and weaknesses of the open-source ecosystem.

The Main Challenge of Open Source Adoption
Contrary to common assumption, the primary obstacle to large-scale adoption of open-source systems
is not a lack of quality software. Open source provides an abundance of mature, secure, and capable
tools that can rival proprietary alternatives.
The core challenge lies in fragmentation and diversity. While diversity is a major strength from an
innovation standpoint, it becomes a liability when the objective is broad public adoption. The large
number of distributions, package formats, desktop environments, configuration methods, and
software management tools creates a steep learning curve for non-technical users and significantly
complicates support.
In practice:
    â¢ Two Linux systems may behave very differently despite sharing core components
    â¢ Documentation and support advice often fail to translate across distributions
    â¢ Troubleshooting depends on system-specific knowledge rather than shared experience

Comparison with Proprietary Platforms
On proprietary platforms such as Microsoft Windows, the underlying system is largely uniform. This
uniformity enables a powerful social support mechanism: users can easily ask a neighbour, colleague,
or friend for help because the environment is familiar and predictable.
This shared baseline dramatically lowers the barrier to entry and reduces reliance on professional
support channels. It is not a technical advantage, but a standardisation advantage.
At present, open source lacks such a shared baseline for the general public.

A Possible Role for the European Union
The European Union is uniquely positioned to address this structural issue.
Rather than replacing or controlling the open-source ecosystem, the EU could support and endorse a
reference distribution or platform designed for public administrations, education, and citizens. Such a
platform would not remove freedom of choice, but would establish:
    â¢ A common base system
    â¢ A standardised package management approach
    â¢ Consistent system configuration tools
    â¢ A unified, user-friendly software management interface
This would allow documentation, training, and support to scale efficiently across borders and
institutions.

User Experience and Interface Consistency
Although system management has improved significantlyâparticularly through graphical interfacesâ
the lack of consistent user experience remains a major barrier for non-technical users.
Different distributions expose different tools, workflows, layouts, and terminology for identical tasks.
For the general public, this inconsistency creates confusion and reduces confidence, even when
systems are stable and reliable.
A standardised approach to user-facing system management would substantially improve usability,
trust, and adoption.

Desktop Environment Standardisation
For broad public adoption, a reference platform should define a single, generally supported desktop
environment as its default. This environment should be mature, stable, well-documented, accessible,
and suitable for long-term institutional use.
Selecting a familiar and user-friendly optionâsuch as Cinnamon, as an exampleâwould provide a
consistent experience across administrations, education, and citizens. Alternative environments
should remain available, but one reference desktop would create a shared baseline that simplifies
training, documentation, accessibility support, and peer-to-peer assistance.

Clear Support for a Chosen Software Package (Example-Based)
A coherent platform also requires clarity regarding which end-user applications are formally supported
as reference implementations. This does not restrict choice, but ensures that users, educators, and
support organisations know which tools are covered by official documentation and training.
For example, an office productivity suite such as LibreOffice could be designated as a reference
application, accompanied by structured learning materials and formal lessons. This enables
institutions to build shared expertise while continuing to allow alternative solutions where
appropriate.

A Single Installation Methodology and Software Store
Consistency in software installation and updates is essential for usability and supportability. A
reference platform should therefore define one primary installation methodology and one official
software store with predictable behaviour and a stable interface.
Multiple parallel installation systems fragment documentation, increase user confusion, and raise
support costs. Standardising how software is discovered, installed, updated, and removed makes the
platform easier to understand, more secure to maintain, and significantly more accessible to non-
technical users.

Formal Integration of Open Source in Education
Education plays a decisive role in shaping long-term digital skills. Today, much of European primary,
secondary, and higher education relies predominantly on non-European proprietary platforms, most
notably Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office.
As a result, students are implicitly trained to associate digital literacy with specific commercial
products rather than with transferable concepts and open standards. This engrains vendor-specific
ecosystems into the future workforce, creating long-term dependency and limiting technological
sovereignty.
Formally integrating open-source software into educational curricula would shift the focus from
products to principles: operating systems, file formats, interoperability, scripting, and problem-solving.
This does not require excluding proprietary tools, but it does require deliberate balance.
Effective integration should include:
    â¢ Official recognition of open-source platforms in curricula
    â¢ Structured teaching materials aligned with open standards
    â¢ Teacher training and long-term support
    â¢ Alignment with reference platforms used in public administration

Promoting Open Source Mobile Platforms
Mobile platforms have become the primary computing environment for many citizens. Today, Europe
is almost entirely dependent on two non-European ecosystems: Googleâs Android and Appleâs iOS.
This duopoly controls operating systems, application distribution, security models, and data flows.
The objective is not to eliminate these platforms, but to support credible open-source alternatives
that can coexist and mature. Existing open-source mobile operating systemsâsuch as LineageOS,
Sailfish OS, or Ubuntu Touchâcurrently lack coordinated institutional backing and integration into
public use cases.
The EU could play a key enabling role by:
    â¢ Supporting one or more open-source mobile platforms as reference systems
    â¢ Encouraging hardware vendors to provide compatible devices and drivers
    â¢ Ensuring access to essential services through open standards and web-based solutions
    â¢ Deploying open-source mobile systems in public-sector pilot programs
Public digital services should prioritise platform-neutral access, avoiding dependency on proprietary
app stores or vendor-specific APIs.
Bringing Open Source into the Consumer Market
For open source to achieve meaningful adoption beyond technical communities, it must move out of
its perception as a specialist domain and become visible, accessible, and normalised for everyday
consumers.
Retail environments play a decisive role in shaping user choice. Today, consumer hardware is
overwhelmingly sold with preinstalled proprietary software, effectively excluding open-source options
at the point of sale.
The EU could address this gap by supporting hardware vendors and retailers that offer devices
preinstalled with a reference open-source operating system. Measures could include:
    â¢ Tax incentives or reduced VAT for certified open-source devices
    â¢ Incentives for manufacturers offering preinstalled open-source systems
    â¢ Retail staff training and basic customer guidance
    â¢ Clear labelling and certification schemes
Preinstallation is critical: for non-technical users, the system must work out of the box without manual
installation.

Leveraging Public Procurement
Public procurement is one of the most effective tools available to the European Union to influence
market behaviour. By recognising and rewarding compliance with open standards, open-source
reference platforms, and vendor-neutral architectures in public tenders, the EU can create sustained
demand for open-source solutions.
This does not require excluding proprietary vendors, but ensuring that procurement criteria do not
implicitly favour closed ecosystems through format lock-in or licensing dependencies.

Strengthening Open Standards
Open-source adoption must be accompanied by a strong commitment to open standards for file
formats, communication protocols, and data exchange. Without this, platform neutrality cannot be
sustained.
Ensuring that public services and educational materials rely on open standards guarantees long-term
accessibility, interoperability, and vendor independence.
Professional Support and Certification
For open-source platforms to be trusted at scale, a professional support ecosystem must be
encouraged. Certification programs for system integrators, support providers, and trainers aligned
with the reference platform would strengthen trust and accountability.
Such an ecosystem would also support SMEs, create local employment opportunities, and ensure
reliable long-term support.

Changing the Default Narrative
Open source should no longer be framed as an alternative for specialised users, but as a credible
default option for everyday digital needs. Achieving this shift requires coordinated action across policy,
education, procurement, retail, and public services.

Conclusion
Open-source software already provides Europe with the technical foundations required for secure,
modern, and competitive digital systems. The barriers to its broader adoption are not rooted in
capability, but in structure: fragmentation, lack of standardisation, and insufficient institutional
support prevent open source from reaching its full potential as a mainstream option for citizens,
education, and public administration.
This document outlines how the European Union can act as an enabler rather than a controller of the
open-source ecosystem. By endorsing reference platforms, promoting consistency in user experience
and software management, integrating open source into education, supporting open-source mobile
alternatives, leveraging public procurement, and enabling consumer-market availability, the EU can
create the conditions in which open-source solutions can scale sustainably.
Crucially, this approach does not eliminate choice or innovation. Instead, it establishes a shared
baseline that reduces complexity, lowers adoption barriers, and enables transferable skills and
knowledge across borders and sectors. It also strengthens digital sovereignty by reducing long-term
dependency on non-European platforms while preserving interoperability through open standards.
A coordinated, pragmatic, and incremental strategy will allow open-source platforms to evolve from
niche alternatives into credible defaults for everyday digital needs. In doing so, the European Union
can ensure that its digital future remains open, resilient, and aligned with the public interest.
