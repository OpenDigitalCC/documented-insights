Feedback from CERN

1. What is the problem the initiative aims to address?
Europe faces competitiveness and autonomy challenges due to reliance on digital infrastructure
controlled by a few non-European providers, creating risks like vendor lock-in, security issues, and
weak supply chains. Open-source software underpins much of the infrastructure but lacks
recognition and funding as critical infrastructure, resulting in fragmented support. Further
fragmentation between Member States impedes interoperability. CERNâs experience shows that
without institutional backing, funding, and governance, even popular open technologies are at risk.

2. What should be the objectives of the initiative?
The initiative should treat open digital ecosystems as vital public infrastructure, strengthening
Europeâs capacity to design, adopt, operate, and govern digital infrastructures through openness,
collaboration, and interoperability. Its aim is to help Europe manage and sustain key digital
technologies for public services, research, and the economy, while remaining active in global
innovation and promoting better exploitation within Europe. Openness, interoperability, and
standards must be default for publicly funded digital infrastructure with open-source support.
Expanding on Open Science and FAIR data, the initiative should apply shared governance and
stewardship models beyond research. Strategic autonomy means institutional capability, not
isolation.

3. What policy options or actions should be considered?
CERN platforms such as Zenodo and Indico demonstrate the need for sustained funding beyond
short-term cycles. A coordinated mix of regulatory, funding, and organisational measures is needed:
    â¢ Public procurement should mandate open standards and interoperability with fair
        evaluation of open-source and non-vendor solutions.
    â¢ EU funding should cover the full lifecycle of open digital infrastructures, including
        maintenance, security, operations, and evolution.
    â¢ Institutional funding should complement project-based funding to ensure continuity.
    â¢ Evaluation frameworks should recognise open-source, open hardware, and infrastructure
        contributions in professional and academic careers.

4. What areas should be prioritised to maximise impact?
EU action should focus on areas with clear added value:
    â¢ Federated, interoperable platforms enabling cross-border reuse
    â¢ Scalable open infrastructure services operated by trusted institutions
    â¢ User-centric digital services lowering adoption barriers
    â¢ Open-source hardware, such as GPUs and ASICs, to reduce strategic dependencies
    â¢ Research and education infrastructures as testbeds for open ecosystems

                                                                                            Page | 2
5. What governance and support structures are needed?
Governance should be institutional, distributed, and anchored in trusted public organisations with
demonstrated technical expertise. Neutral public institutions must hold real authority to ensure
long-term stewardship. European research and infrastructure organisations, including CERN and
other EIROs, drawing on experience with platforms like Zenodo and Indico and with major scientific
and engineering software such as ROOT and Geant4, should act as competence centres for open
digital technologies, in partnership with industry and open-source communities.

6. What is the EU added value of this initiative?
No single Member State can sustainably operate open digital infrastructure at the required scale.
EU-level action is essential to pool risk, cost, and expertise, align funding and procurement, and
reduce fragmentation. Empowering trusted institutions as coordinating and operating hubs will
accelerate resilient European open digital ecosystems.

7. Final remarks
European open digital ecosystems should be recognised and funded as strategic public
infrastructure, comparable to energy or transport networks. Europe already has a proven model in
Open Science. This initiative provides a timely opportunity to extend that model to the broader
digital domain through sustained commitment and structural investment.
