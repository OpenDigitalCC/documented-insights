                       Executive Summary on Open Digital Ecosystems
                       The European Union faces a strategic crossroads regarding the adoption and development
                       of open-source technologies for cloud services. While open source has become a global
                       driver of innovation, competition, and technological independence, Europe currently plays
                       a limited role in leading major open-source projects. Most significant initiativesâespecially
                       those shaping cloud and digital infrastructure, such as Kubernetes or Linuxâare governed
                       by US-based organisations like the Linux Foundation, whose European footprint remains
                       minimal. This structural reliance weakens Europeâs capacity to shape standards, ensure
                       technological sovereignty, and build secure, interoperable cloud infrastructures.

                       Several barriers slow down both the adoption and the sustainable development of
                       high-quality open-source solutions in Europe. Organisations often face vendor lock-in from
                       incumbent technology providers, making migration costly and risky. The proliferation of
                       competing open-source projects also complicates identifying stable and widely adopted
                       options. In addition, many open-source communities are effectively controlled by a single
                       vendor, creating de facto proprietary models that reduce trust and hinder broad European
                       participation. From a contribution standpoint, companies must allocate significant
                       technical and promotional resourcesâan investment that many struggle to justify without
                       targeted support mechanisms.

                       Despite these challenges, open source delivers substantial added value for both public and
                       private sectors. It promotes standardisation, reduces operational complexity, accelerates
                       time-to-market for technology providers, and lowers costs by stimulating competition.
                       Equally important, open source ensures independence from proprietary vendors, giving
                       organisations full control over the evolution of their digital solutionsâan essential
                       component of security and resilience. For instance, the widespread adoption of
                       Kubernetes has enabled interoperability across cloud providers and reduced the risk of
                       lock-in, creating a more dynamic and competitive cloud ecosystem.

                       To strengthen Europeâs open-source ecosystem and reinforce technological sovereignty,
                       coordinated action at EU level is required. Possible measures include identifying and
                       promoting open-source projects critical to Europeâs digital future, providing financial
                       incentives to companies contributing to those projects, and incorporating open-source
                       requirements into public procurement processes when suitable solutions exist. Such
                       actions would foster competition, accelerate innovation, and reduce dependency on
                       non-European vendors.

                       Strategic prioritisation is essential. Europe should focus on technological domains where
                       it currently lacks strong providersâsuch as hardware, AI, and cybersecurityâas well as
                       emerging digital infrastructures where early leadership can be decisive. By doing so, Europe
                       can ensure it retains control over core technologies underpinning its future
                       competitiveness.

                       Finally, increased use of open source has the potential to enhance competitiveness and
                       cyber-resilience across all sectors. Open ecosystems naturally promote transparency,

                       rapid innovation cycles, shared security practices, and interoperabilityâkey attributes for
                       a robust and sovereign digital Europe.

                       In this context, developing and adopting a European sovereign cloud, built on open
                       standards and open-source technologies, becomes a strategic necessity. Public
                       institutions should lead this shift by integrating open-source-based solutions into their
                       digital infrastructure and procurement policy, fostering buy European. This will not only
                       strengthen Europeâs autonomy but also set a baseline for trust, security, and long-term
                       technological independence.

                       TelefÃ³nicaâs insights on the Call for Input for EU
                       Open Digital Ecosystems.

                       1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are
                          the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and
                          secure open source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source
                          communities?

                             The weakness of EU in open source is the fact that most of the current projects are not
                             promoted by European organisations. Linux Foundation, that is the biggest organisation
                             promoting open-source projects is US based, opened a European branch (2 years ago)
                             that only hosts 6 open-source projects. No speciï¬c strengths.

                             The main barriers for a company in adopting open source come from the potential
                             vendor lock-in of existing vendors that prevent from swapping to a di5erent solution and
                             the time required to identify the appropriate open source project to adopt for an speciï¬c
                             functionality, because there are many open source projects that arise and it takes time
                             for the consolidation of the standard one, to be adopted by many, for an speciï¬c
                             functionality.

                             Another barrier is the fact that many opensource projects are promoted and contributed
                             by one single organisation (typically a software provider for the functionality) making it
                             very close to proprietary solutions, not standardised, hence generating mistrust.

                             The main barrier for contributing is the fact that it requires resources and budget. Open
                             source communities are intended to have volunteer contributors but if a company
                             wants a given project to progress (either to become a vendor provider for the
                             functionality or to become a user that ï¬nds providers) there is a need to apply resources
                             to code development/testing and also to marketing activities to promote the
                             community.

                       2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
                          provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in,
                          security, innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added
                          value.

                             Beneï¬ts of adopting opensource are:

                             â¢      standardisation (e.g.: kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for container
                                    orchestration) which means that many providers of such functionality adopt it,
                                    making easier integration with other functionalities, reducing cost of operation (not
                                    need to learn multiple technologies for di5erent vendors) and preventing vendor
                                    lock-in.

                             â¢      reduce time to market for providers of a given functionality because access to the
                                    code is available and providers can take the code to reduce their development
                                    e5orts and improve the solution with add-ons.

                             â¢      reduce costs because having free access to open code fosters concurrence for
                                    functionality vendors.

                             â¢      reduce cost because open-source licences are free (typically Apache 2.0) but this
                                    is to be taken with care because deploying in production an open source based
                                    functionality requires someone to provide support and maintenance that comes
                                    with a cost.

                             â¢      independence to evolve a given solution since the code is not proprietary, therefore
                                    there is not dependency from a single vendor that may limit or make costly evolution
                                    of the functionality.

                       3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
                          development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
                          technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

                             â¢      EU could identify and promote creation of new open-source projects of special
                                    interest for functionalities required for Europe technology/digital evolution.
                             â¢      EU could provide ï¬nancial support to companies contributing to open-source
                                    projects that are of special interest for Europe technology/digital evolution.
                             â¢      The main problem is identifying such special interest functionalities.
                             â¢      EU could include the requirement to incorporate open source-based solutions
                                    (when available) in public tenders. This will not prevent from having proprietary
                                    solutions procured but competition will be fostered.

                       4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

                             This is the main problem, identifying such special interest functionalities. EU should
                             focus on technology where we the sector is lacking providers in Europe or are new
                             functionalities.

                             Examples could be hardware related functionality, promoting open hardware. We have
                             not hardware providers in Europe.

                             Examples could be AI and cybersecurity related functionalities.

                       5. In what sectors could an increased use of open-source lead to increased
                          competitiveness and cyber resilience?

                             In all sectors. Open source, per se, fosters innovation, promotes standardization and
                             generates competition.
