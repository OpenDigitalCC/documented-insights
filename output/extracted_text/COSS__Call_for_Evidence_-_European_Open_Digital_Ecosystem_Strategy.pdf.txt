                                                               3.2.2026

Dear Members of the European Commission,

COSS â The Finnish Centre for Open Systems and Solutions (Open Source Finland) welcomes the
opportunity to respond to the call for evidence on the European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy.

COSS is a national non-profit association whose members include around 50 Finnish companies and
organizations that make significant use of open source software in their operations. The associationâs main
objective is to promote the use of open source and digital sovereignty in Finland and Europe.

Strengths and weaknesses

The EU open source sector is built on strong foundations. Open source is widely adopted across software
development and service delivery, and Europe benefits from a high level of technical expertise, mature
developer communities, and a growing base of professional service providers. These strengths directly support
the EUâs objectives related to digital sovereignty, cybersecurity, interoperability, and innovation capacity.

However, a number of structural challenges continue to limit the full potential of open source adoption.
Decision-making processes in both public and private organisations are often slow, and established
procurement and governance practices tend to favour familiar proprietary models. As a result, even when open
source solutions are technically mature and strategically advantageous, their adoption can be delayed or
fragmented.

The sustainable adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source solutions is also affected by
limited productisation and insufficient market visibility. Many open source solutions are robust and widely
used, but a lack of investment in usability, documentation, packaging, and communication can make them
harder to evaluate, procure, and operate at scale, particularly in the public sector.

Another persistent challenge relates to sustainability and collaboration. Open source is still frequently
approached through legacy business and funding models that are not well aligned with collaborative
development and shared ownership. Incentives for long-term contribution are often unclear, and public
administrations in particular lack well-defined mechanisms to support the communities and projects they rely
on. Dedicated innovation funding for open source remains limited, and there is uncertainty about how such
funding can be structured in a way that supports community sustainability while remaining compatible with fair
competition and commercial activity.

                                                               3.2.2026

Added value

Open source delivers significant added value for both the public and private sectors by strengthening
collaboration, reducing risk, increasing transparency, and accelerating innovation. Open development models
make work visible, shared, and reusable, enabling multiple actors to collaborate on common solutions instead
of duplicating effort. This is especially valuable in complex, multi-actor environments where interoperability and
alignment are essential.

From a risk management perspective, open source enables collective assessment and mitigation. Organisations
can compare alternatives, select solutions that best meet their needs, and avoid dependency on a single
supplier. By reducing vendor lock-in, open source preserves flexibility in procurement, operations, and
long-term strategic planning for public administrations and companies alike.

Transparency is a further key source of value. Open development ensures that digital systems are not âblack
boxesâ: changes are traceable, decisions are documented, and responsibilities are visible. Version control
histories, for example, provide detailed records of what changed, when, and why, supporting accountability,
quality assurance, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

Open source also contributes directly to cybersecurity and trust. Transparent codebases enable independent
auditing and reproducibility, and well-governed contribution and review processes can improve security
outcomes through broader scrutiny. Vulnerabilities can be identified and addressed in ways that are visible and
verifiable, rather than relying solely on assurances from a single vendor.

From a financial and operational perspective, open source improves predictability and efficiency. Organisations
typically invest in the services they actually needâsuch as support, integration, hosting, or further
developmentâwithout unpredictable licensing constraints. Reuse of existing, widely adopted components
reduces unnecessary duplication, and ownership remains with the organisation funding or deploying the
solution. This ensures that critical digital capabilities remain under the control of users and public authorities.

Concrete measures

At EU level, concrete measures can be taken to support the development and growth of the EU open source
sector while advancing the EUâs technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda. First, the EU should ensure
that taxpayersâ money is not used to fund the development of closed solutions, and should instead actively
reduce the share and strategic importance of closed-source software in publicly funded projects. This can be
achieved by establishing clear policy principles and funding criteria that prioritize open source outcomes

whenever public money is involved, unless there is a well-justified and independently verified reason to do
otherwise.

Second, the EU could strengthen the open source ecosystem by funding the cloud and supporting services that
open source communities and EU-based organizations need in practice. This could include providing EU
companies and communities with access to essential infrastructure such as software and code repositories, as
well as production automation services like CI/CD. Such support could be delivered either by directly financing
these services or by funding an organization that operates and maintains them as shared European capabilities,
thereby reducing reliance on non-EU platforms and improving resilience.

Third, the EU should safeguard the freedom of action of Member States through regulation and procurement
requirements. In all public procurement, there should be a systematic requirement to avoid vendor lock-in, and
procurement should not allow closed solutions unless there is a specific and independently validated
justification. In parallel, the terms of use and licensing conditions of adopted services and solutions should be
required to guarantee the customerâs operational freedom, so that public administrations and companies
retain the ability to maintain, modify, migrate, and competitively source their digital systems over time.

Areas to be prioritised

At EU level, a coherent set of targeted measures can further strengthen the open source ecosystem while
directly advancing the Unionâs objectives on technological sovereignty, cybersecurity, resilience, and
competitiveness.

First, publicly funded digital development should systematically prioritise open source outcomes. As a general
principle, public funding should not result in new closed-source dependencies where viable open source
alternatives exist. This principle should be reflected explicitly in EU funding programmes, work programmes,
and evaluation criteria, for example by requiring that software developed with public funds is released under
an open source licence by default. Exceptions should be limited to cases where a closed approach is
demonstrably necessary and supported by a clear, independently assessed justification.

Second, the EU should strengthen the practical foundations of the open source ecosystem by supporting
shared infrastructure and services that are essential for professional, secure, and sustainable development.
Open source communities and European organisations rely on development platforms such as code
repositories, issue and vulnerability tracking systems, and automation services including CI/CD pipelines. These
capabilities could be supported through dedicated EU funding, or by mandating and financing one or more
organisations to operate them as shared European assets under open governance. This would reduce
structural reliance on non-EU platforms, improve software supply-chain security, and lower entry barriers for
European open source projects and service providers.

Third, the EU should provide clearer and more operational guidance on the lawful use of public procurement as
a strategic instrument for open source adoption. Existing EU case law has already recognised that, due to the
specific nature of open source softwareâwhere the source code is openly available and no single vendor holds
exclusive controlâpublic administrations may, under appropriate conditions, refer to specific open source
solutions by name in procurement processes. Unlike proprietary products, naming an open source solution
does not restrict competition, as any qualified supplier can offer services, support, integration, or further
development around the same software. This interpretation should be explicitly acknowledged in Commission
guidance on public procurement, supported by practical examples and model clauses. In parallel, procurement
rules should systematically require the avoidance of vendor lock-in and ensure that contractual and licensing
terms guarantee operational freedom, including the ability to maintain, modify, migrate, and competitively
source digital systems over time.

Fourth, the EU should establish systematic support for the long-term maintenance of critical open source
components that underpin public sector systems, critical infrastructure, and the wider European digital
economy. Many essential open source components are widely reused but structurally under-resourced. The EU
should identify such components and provide predictable funding for maintenance, security updates, quality
assurance, and governance. This could be achieved through dedicated maintenance funding instruments or by
integrating long-term maintenance obligations into existing EU programmes. Supporting maintenance directly
reduces systemic risk and strengthens Europeâs cyber resilience and technological autonomy.

Fifth, the EU should promote open governance and European stewardship of strategically important open
source projects. Digital independence depends not only on access to source code, but also on who influences
the direction and governance of critical technologies. The EU should encourage governance models that are
transparent, inclusive, and resistant to single-actor dominance, including support for European foundations,
neutral stewardship structures, and community-led governance. Strengthening European participation in the
governance of key open source projects ensures that critical digital infrastructure evolves in line with European
values, regulatory requirements, and long-term public interest, while remaining globally open and competitive.

Sectors for Competitiveness & Cyber Resilience

The public sector is the key sector where procurement choices can most effectively increase both cyber
resilience and the competitiveness of the European open source ecosystem. As one of the largest purchasers of
digital technology in Europe, the public sector has a unique ability to shape markets through procurement
criteria. By systematically favouring open source solutions that meet functional, security, and quality
requirements, public administrations can create predictable and long-term demand for open source
technologies and services.

When public administrations procure open source solutions for core systemsâsuch as digital workplaces,
identity management, collaboration platforms, registries, and service backendsâthey gain transparency,
auditability, and operational control over their digital infrastructure. At the same time, procurement that
favours vendor independence lowers market entry barriers for European companies. Instead of competing on
proprietary licences or exclusive platform access, suppliers compete on service quality, security expertise,
domain knowledge, and long-term support capabilities. This enables SMEs and specialised providers to
participate meaningfully in public tenders and to scale their offerings across regions and Member States.

Public procurement thus functions as a demand-side policy instrument that directly supports the growth of
European open source businesses. Clear and consistent procurement practices give companies the confidence
to invest in skills, maintenance capacity, and community engagement. Over time, this strengthens the quality
and sustainability of open source solutions available on the market, benefiting both public and private sector
users.

The benefits extend beyond public administration. A strong European open source service market enhances
resilience and competitiveness across industry, critical infrastructure, and digital services more broadly. By
using procurement to favour open source in a legally sound manner, the EU and its Member States can
simultaneously improve the robustness of public digital services and foster a resilient, competitive European
open source economy.
