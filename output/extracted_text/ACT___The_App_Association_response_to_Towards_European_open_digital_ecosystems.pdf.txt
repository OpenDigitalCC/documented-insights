I.    Introduction

ACT | The App Association (hereafter âACTâ) welcomes the opportunity to submit comments
to the European Commissionâs consultation on the European open digital ecosystems
initiative.

ACT is a policy trade association for the small business technology developer community.
Our members are entrepreneurs, innovators, and independent developers within the global
app ecosystem that engage with verticals across every industry. We work with and for our
members to promote a policy environment that rewards and inspires innovation while
providing resources that help them raise capital, create jobs, and continue to build
incredible technology. Today, the ecosystem ACT representsâwhich we call the app
economyâis valued at approximately â¬95.7 billion and is responsible for more than 1.4
million jobs in the European Union (EU).1

II. Feedback on the European open digital ecosystems initiative

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are the main
barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source;
and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

Open-source software (OSS), defined by its publicly accessible and modifiable source code,
underpins a substantial share of the digital infrastructure used by European SMEs, startups,
and scaleups. From operating systems and cloud-native tooling to semiconductor design
flows and artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks, OSS enables smaller firms to customise,
develop, deploy, and iterate technologies that would otherwise require prohibitive upfront
investment.

A core strength of the EU open-source ecosystem lies in its ability to lower barriers to entry
and experimentation. SMEs and startups can access state-of-the-art technologiesâ up-front
licensing fees, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on product differentiation, talent, and market
entry. This is especially relevant in the early stages of company formation, where technology
and cost decisions can determine long-term viability. Empirical research indicates that
active engagement with open-source communities is associated with a significantly higher
likelihood of attracting external investment, concretely, 36 per cent higher chances of getting
investment, reflecting both improved technical credibility and stronger integration into
innovation networks.2

At the same time, the EU open-source sector exhibits structural weaknesses that
disproportionately affect SMEs. Many widely-used OSS components are maintained by

small teams or individual developers with limited and unstable funding, and there is limited
strategic recognition at the leadership level of many organisations. This creates challenges
for long-term maintenance, timely security updates, and formal assurance processes,
despite the critical role these components play in commercial products and public
infrastructure. SMEs that rely on such components often lack the resources to
independently maintain or harden them, increasing systemic risk.

Legal and governance complexity is another significant barrier. SMEs frequently lack in-
house legal expertise to fully assess open-source licensing obligations, particularly in cases
involving copyleft licenses or complex dependency chains. Inadvertent non-compliance can
expose firms to litigation risk or force disclosure of proprietary code, which is particularly
problematic in digital markets where traditional IP protection mechanisms, such as patents,
may offer limited practical protection. As a result, some SMEs adopt a risk-averse approach
and avoid certain OSS components altogether, even where they would otherwise be
technically optimal.

Finally, while open source enables rapid development, it can also complicate value capture
for SMEs. When competitors can access the same open-source foundations, differentiation
must occur at higher layers of the stack, such as services, integration, or data. Without
supportive market conditions and clear regulatory frameworks, SMEs may struggle to
convert technical innovation into sustainable commercial advantage, reducing their ability
to contribute back to open-source communities over time.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please provide
concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation,
among others) that are most important to assess the added value.

For both, public administrations and private-sector SMEs, the added value of open source
lies primarily in its impact on cost structures, flexibility, and long-term risk management.
Open source can also mitigate the risk of vendor lock-in, which is a critical consideration for
public-sector digital infrastructure and SME-led innovation alike.

From a security and trust perspective, while open source does not automatically guarantee
security, its openness enables robust assurance processes when combined with
appropriate governance and funding. In innovation-intensive sectors such as AI, cloud
computing, and cybersecurity, open-source frameworks and toolchains have become
widely used, allowing SMEs to compete on functionality and performance rather than on
access to proprietary platforms.

Linux stands as a leading example of beneficial open-source software because its
collaborative, community-driven development model, spanning thousands of contributors
worldwide, has produced a secure, stable, and customisable operating system kernel that
powers the majority of the world's servers, supercomputers, cloud infrastructure,

smartphones (via Android), and embedded devices, all without reliance on any single
proprietary vendor.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

To effectively support the development of the EU open-source sector and strengthen
Europeâs technological sovereignty, EU action should focus on enabling sustainable
participation by SMEs and startups, which form the backbone of Europeâs digital innovation
ecosystem. Open source already underpins a significant share of Europeâs digital
infrastructure, yet its long-term sustainability can remain fragile due to underinvestment,
fragmented support mechanisms, and regulatory frameworks that were not designed with
open, collaborative development models in mind. Addressing these structural challenges is
essential if open source is to fulfil its potential as a driver of competitiveness, resilience, and
innovation.

From an investment perspective, the EU could place greater emphasis on funding the
maintenance, security, and long-term viability of critical open-source components, not only
the creation of new projects. Many of the most widely used open-source technologies are
maintained by small teams or individual developers with limited financial resources, despite
being embedded in commercial products and public infrastructure across Europe.

Access to capital remains a structural barrier for startups and small companies building on
open-source business models. Unlike traditional proprietary software firms, open-source-
based companies often generate value through services, integration, or complementary
products rather than licensing revenue, which can make them less attractive to conventional
investors. EU funding instruments and innovation programmes should therefore explicitly
accommodate and support open-source-based commercial models, ensuring that eligibility
criteria and evaluation metrics do not implicitly favour proprietary approaches. Policies
should aim to preserve flexibility, lower barriers to entry, and enable startups to scale without
being locked into specific technological or commercial models.

In the area of security and privacy, EU action should focus on strengthening the resilience of
open-source ecosystems while avoiding disproportionate obligations that could discourage
participation. Open source plays a central role in Europeâs cybersecurity landscape,
providing transparency, auditability, and rapid vulnerability detection. However, imposing
product-level compliance obligations on volunteer-driven or SME-led open-source projects
may risk undermining the very ecosystems that European industry relies upon. A more
effective approach would be to support coordinated vulnerability disclosure, shared security
tooling, and voluntary certification or assurance mechanisms that scale with the size and
role of the actor involved.

Finally, EU action should promote coherence across digital policy initiatives to ensure that
open-source development is not inadvertently constrained by overlapping or inconsistent
regulatory requirements. Clear guidance on liability, licensing compatibility, and security
responsibilities would significantly reduce legal uncertainty for SMEs and encourage
broader participation in open digital ecosystems. By aligning investment, access to capital,
and security policy with the realities of open-source development, the EU can strengthen its
technological sovereignty while enabling startups and small businesses to innovate,
compete, and grow within a truly open digital economy.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

Building and using technologies developed in open standard-setting organisations (SSOs),
our members drive the EUâs global internet of things (IoT) leadership by creating products
and services that consumers across the European economy enjoy, and thrive in a
transparent, competitive, and fair licensing environment. Priority should be given to
technology areas where open source is both foundational and strategically relevant to EU
competitiveness, and where SMEs play a central role as innovators and implementers.
Standards-based technologies that rely on standard-essential patents (SEPs) are a
particularly important example. SMEs increasingly implement technical standards through
open-source software, and while some SSOs have moved to allow or encourage royalty-free
licensing for standards important to open-source ecosystems, a lack of transparency
around SEP licensing and abuse by a handful of SEP holders creates legal and financial risk
that can deter market entry. Ensuring transparent, predictable, and genuinely fair,
reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) licenses for all to SEPs is therefore essential
for enabling SME participation and for aligning standards policy with open digital
ecosystems. The Commission should recognise royalty-free SSO policies as one form of the
FRAND licensing framework that may be selected.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased competitiveness
and cyber resilience?

Open-source technologies have the potential to enhance both competitiveness and cyber
resilience across multiple sectors, particularly those that are standards-driven, innovation-
intensive, or foundational to Europeâs digital economy. In sectors reliant on SEPs, for
example, royalty-free approaches to technical standards can significantly lower entry
barriers for SMEs and startups, enabling them to develop interoperable products without
facing prohibitive licensing costs or legal uncertainty. By facilitating access to essential
technologies, such an approach fosters a more competitive market environment in which
small developers can innovate alongside established players, contributing to overall
ecosystem dynamism and European technological sovereignty.

In the artificial intelligence sector, open-source frameworks and models play an important
role in innovation, experimentation, and reproducibility, particularly for startups and SMEs
that cannot afford the infrastructure and licensing fees of proprietary solutions. Open-

source AI components enhance cyber resilience by providing transparency, enabling peer
review, and accelerating the detection and remediation of vulnerabilities. However,
regulatory initiatives such as the Cyber Resilience Act, if applied without nuance, risk
restricting access to open-source components or imposing compliance obligations that are
disproportionate for small-scale contributors. This could inadvertently undermine both
innovation and security in the AI sector, reducing the availability of shared tools that startups
rely on to compete and scale.

More broadly, open source supports cyber resilience and competitiveness in public
administration, cloud infrastructure, telecommunications, and internet of things
applications. By providing transparent, interoperable, and auditable building blocks, open-
source technologies reduce dependency on single vendors, lower operational risk, and
empower SMEs to participate in sectors that are increasingly digital and interconnected.
Ensuring that open-source ecosystems remain accessible, well-maintained, and
appropriately supported is therefore essential to unlocking their full potential in
strengthening Europeâs digital economy while safeguarding security and resilience.

ACT remains committed to work together with the European Commission towards a more
competitive and innovation-friendly Europe.
