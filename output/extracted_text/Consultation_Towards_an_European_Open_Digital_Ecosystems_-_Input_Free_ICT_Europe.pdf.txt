Free ICT Europe Position Paper
Consultation: Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems

1. Introduction and Overall Positioning
Free ICT Europe welcomes the European Commissionâs initiative to develop a European
Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy, recognising open source hardware and software as a
strategic pillar for Europeâs technological sovereignty, cybersecurity, sustainability and
competitiveness. We strongly support the Commissionâs ambition to move beyond
fragmented initiatives and to address structural barriers that prevent open digital solutions
from scaling and capturing economic value within the European Union.

However, Free ICT Europe emphasises that open source alone is not sufficient to deliver
digital sovereignty or fair competition. The core challenge faced by European public and
private users is commercial dependency, not merely the use of proprietary technology.
Dependency arises when software vendors combine restrictive licensing, bundled support
models, opaque contractual terms, short support lifecycles and obstacles to make
adjustments by the users; that in all to prevent resale, reuse, independent maintenance and
third-party innovation.

Where user applications, like âofficeâ clearly have open source alternatives, for the large
software applications the challenge is bigger; huge investments made, stability of
operations, risk calculations are some elements that will at least delay the development of
both the software and support market.

For hardware the use of open source operating systems should be made possible, this will
reduce dependency, extend life-cycles and decouple the support requirement. In general no
hardware or software restrictions that enforce proprietary OS.

To further develop an Open Digital Ecosystem, analysis of the vendor driven market is
needed as lessons learned.

After decades where vendors had more or less complete freedom in their market, the
solution should not only focus on open source, though also address that dependencies
should be reduced and increased protection for European organisations that use and own
the systems and applications.

From the perspective of Free ICT Europe, a genuinely open digital ecosystem must therefore
address software as an economic and infrastructural asset throughout its full lifecycle,
including:

                                          Page 1 of 7
   â¢   initial development and deployment,
   â¢   long-term maintenance and security support,
   â¢   resale and reuse of used software in secondary markets,
   â¢   and end-of-support transition to third-party or community-based maintenance.

Without these elements, Europe risks replacing one form of dependency with another,
including new lock-ins around âopen but commercially closedâ ecosystems.

2. Market Analysis: Structural Challenges in the European Software
Ecosystem
2.1 Concentration, Lock-in and Lifecycle Control

The European software market is characterised by high concentration and strong network
effects, particularly in operating systems, enterprise applications, databases and cloud-based
workplace environments. SaaS based distribution of software results in less consumer
control and an increased vendor lock-in. Dominant global vendors retain control not only
over software code, but also over:

   â¢   licensing models (shift from perpetual to a more expensive subscription),
   â¢   access to updates and security patches,
   â¢   audit practices and compliance enforcement,
   â¢   Forced hardware upgrades, software wonât run otherwise,
   â¢   and end-of-support timelines.

As documented by Free ICT Europe members, support lifecycles have been progressively
shortened (from 10â12 years to 5â7 years in many cases), forcing premature migrations and
hardware replacement, increasing costs and electronic waste, and undermining
sustainability objectives.

Under a subscription model clients have to upgrade in the vendor's timeline... if they don't
they are still paying for the right to use without the support and can't stop paying else they
lose their right-to-use.

This control structure limits the ability of European SMEs, public authorities and refurbishers
to extend software and hardware lifetimes, even where systems remain technically fit for
purpose.

2.2 Software Resale and the Secondary Market

An Open Source product is not free of charge. It will only become mature if there is the
business case in supply and especially support. Hence companies will need to offer
supported versions and optional support under a licence or a subscription.

ECJ case law has established that used software can constitute as an asset eligible for resale
(if a copy or downloaded software has a perpetual use license, this must be considered as
âsale of goodsâ), yet in practice the secondary software market remains legally and
commercially fragile. Obstacles include:

   â¢   contractual clauses restricting licence transfer,
   â¢   vendor refusal to provide updates or security patches to secondary users,
   â¢   lack of recognised quality standards or codes of conduct,
   â¢   and widespread market distrust caused by fraudulent or non-functional offers.

Despite these challenges, the secondary market is strategically important for:

   â¢   affordability for SMEs and public bodies,
   â¢   sustainability and lifecycle extension,
   â¢   competition and price discipline in primary markets.

An open digital ecosystem must therefore explicitly recognise and legitimise secondary
software markets.

2.3 Open Source: Opportunities and Limits

Free ICT Europe fully recognises the value of open source for transparency, innovation and
resilience. At the same time, market experience shows that:

   â¢   many organisations still perceive open source as risky due to unclear accountability
       and support models;
   â¢   commercial open-source ecosystems can recreate lock-in through exclusive support
       or certification schemes;
   â¢   and security outcomes depend less on licence type than on governance,
       organisational maturity and long-term maintenance capacity;
   â¢   (independent) ICT providers do not have a clear business case related to open
       source, while a business model is needed for wider market adoption, especially for
       the private sector.

Open source should therefore be understood as one instrument within a broader openness
framework, not as a binary alternative to proprietary software.

                                          Page 3 of 7
Hence, Free ICTâs emphasis that attention for open source is a needed step, though, the
market needs reduced vendor control and dependencies that will be covering the
proprietary market, crucial for sovereignty, cybersecurity, sustainability and
competitiveness.

3. Free ICT Europeâs Core Policy Positions
3.1 Software Must No Longer Be Treated as a âBlack Boxâ

Free ICT Europe strongly argues that software can no longer be treated as an untouchable
âblack boxâ governed solely by vendor-defined terms.

Software acts as a digital key controlling access to hardware functionality, data, and
organisational processes.

Where users have paid for software licenses or subscriptions, the EU should ensure:

   â¢   meaningful control over its lifecycle,
   â¢   freedom to change support providers,
   â¢   and the ability to reuse or resell software assets lawfully.

This principle aligns directly with EU objectives on competitiveness, sustainability and
strategic autonomy.

3.2 Separation of Software Ownership and Support

A cornerstone of an open digital ecosystem is the decoupling of software ownership from
vendor-control. Free ICT Europe advocates that:

   â¢   users who lawfully own software licences must be free to obtain maintenance and
       support from third parties;
   â¢   vendors should not use access to security updates as a leverage mechanism to
       enforce commercial dependency;
   â¢   security patch access should be guaranteed for the useful lifetime, which would be
       10 to 12 years, not just the controlled refresh cycle (and irrespective of support
       provider).

This principle is particularly relevant in the context of the Cyber Resilience Act, where long-
term security obligations are already recognised.

                                           Page 4 of 7
3.3 âSecond-Life Software Supportâ After End-of-Support

When vendors unilaterally terminate support for widely deployed software, valuable digital
assets risk becoming unusable or insecure. Free ICT Europe therefore proposes a âsecond-
lifeâ mechanism, whereby:

   â¢   upon vendor end-of-support of a product or software version, essential technical
       interfaces (APIs, protocols, documentation) and, where feasible, source code are
       made available. Eventually under controlled conditions or with contracts in place
       with third parties;
   â¢   this enables independent European providers to deliver continued maintenance,
       security and compatibility support;
   â¢   preserving value for users while reducing forced migrations and waste.

This approach does not eliminate proprietary business models, but balances intellectual
property with societal and economic interests.

4. Recommendations to the European Commission
4.1 Strategic Recognition of Software Lifecycle Openness

The Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy should explicitly recognise:

   â¢   Used software license resale,
   â¢   freedom of choice for provider and (third-party) support,
   â¢   and an open market for post-vendor maintenance
   â¢   Provide funding support for Open Source Maintainers

as legitimate and desirable components of a competitive European digital economy.

4.2 Funding and Governance Support

EU funding instruments should:

   â¢   support sustainable governance models for open-source and hybrid software;
   â¢   include maintenance, documentation and long-term support as eligible costs;
   â¢   facilitate collaboration between developers, users, refurbishers and third-party
       support providers.

                                         Page 5 of 7
4.3 Interoperability and Open Standards

In line with existing Free ICT Europe positions, the Commission should:

   â¢   prioritise open standards and open data formats;
   â¢   require that publicly funded software tools be released under open licences where
       possible;
   â¢   ensure interoperability obligations are enforceable in practice, not only in principle.

4.4 Trust and Market Organisation

The Commission should encourage:

   â¢   recognised codes of conduct for secondary software markets;
   â¢   transparency requirements for licence provenance and functionality;
   â¢   and cooperation with industry-led initiatives that aim to professionalise and stabilise
       these markets.

5. Conclusion
Free ICT Europe strongly supports the Commissionâs ambition to build a European Open
Digital Ecosystem. To succeed, this strategy must go beyond promoting open source
development and address the economic realities of software dependency, lifecycle control
and market concentration.

For non-open source hardware and especially software the decencies should be reduced,
restrictive practices and lock-ins to be removed; responsibilities and freedom to maintain in
line with any other tangible product.

By recognising software resale (used software), third-party support and second-life
maintenance as integral elements of openness, the EU can:

   â¢   strengthen digital sovereignty,
   â¢   reduce costs and environmental impact,
   â¢   empower SMEs and public authorities,
   â¢   and ensure that digital value created in Europe is retained in Europe.

Free ICT Europe stands ready to contribute further expertise and market insight as this
strategy is developed and implemented.
