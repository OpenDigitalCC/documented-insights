TOWARDS A SOVEREIGN, OPEN AND
INTEGRATED EUROPEAN DIGITAL
ECOSYSTEM
A European Industrial and Technological Strategy for
Open Digital Systems (2026â2035)

1. Executive Summary
The European Union is facing a structural and systemic dependency on non-European
digital technologies across operating systems, cloud infrastructure, platforms, software
ecosystems, hardware supply chains and artificial intelligence.

This dependency undermines:

   ââ   Europeâs strategic autonomy
   ââ   The competitiveness of European industry
   ââ   The resilience of public administrations
   ââ   The sovereignty of European data
   ââ   The capacity of Europe to innovate independently

In line with the European Commission initiative âTowards Open Digital Systems in Europeâ,
this document proposes a continental-scale industrial and technological strategy to establish
a fully sovereign, open, interoperable and competitive European digital ecosystem by 2035.

Open source shall be recognized not merely as a licensing model, but as a strategic
industrial, economic and geopolitical asset.
2. Strategic Context
Digital technologies have become critical infrastructure. Europe currently depends heavily on
non-European actors for:

   ââ   Mobile and desktop operating systems
   ââ   Cloud and AI infrastructure
   ââ   Productivity and collaboration platforms
   ââ   Search, identity, app distribution and data ecosystems
   ââ   Core hardware and semiconductor supply chains

This creates:

   ââ   Strategic vulnerabilities
   ââ   Economic value extraction outside the EU
   ââ   Lock-in effects for citizens, businesses and administrations
   ââ   Reduced innovation capacity for European SMEs and startups

The transition towards open, interoperable digital systems is therefore not optional, but a
strategic necessity.

3. Strategic Objectives
The European Union shall commit to the following objectives:

   1.â Establish full digital sovereignty across all critical layers of the digital stack by 2035
   2.â Make open source the default foundation of Europeâs digital infrastructure
   3.â Eliminate structural dependencies on non-European platform ecosystems
   4.â Create a competitive, innovation-driven European digital industry
   5.â Strengthen Europeâs startup, SME and open innovation ecosystems

4. The European Open Digital Systems Program
(EODSP)
The EU shall establish a permanent European Open Digital Systems Program with:

   ââ A structural budget of at least â¬50â100 billion per year
   ââ Long-term multi-annual financial commitments
   ââ Integration with Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, IPCEIs and the Chips Act

This program shall treat digital infrastructure as strategic infrastructure, comparable to
energy, transport and defense.
5. Governance: The European Open Digital Alliance
A European Open Digital Alliance shall be created to federate and coordinate:

   ââ   Open source foundations and communities
   ââ   European SMEs and scale-ups
   ââ   Industrial actors
   ââ   Cloud and infrastructure providers
   ââ   Research institutions and public administrations

Key ecosystem actors include (non-exhaustive):

   ââ   Proton, Nextcloud, Murena (/e/OS)
   ââ   Qwant, Startpage, Ecosia
   ââ   KDE, GNOME, Matrix, Jitsi, LibreOffice, OnlyOffice

6. Pillar I: European Open Operating System
Ecosystem
The EU shall support the development of a fully integrated, open, European operating
system ecosystem for:

   ââ   Smartphones
   ââ   Laptops and desktops
   ââ   Public sector workstations
   ââ   Cloud and virtual environments

This ecosystem shall be:

   ââ   Based on open source components
   ââ   Interoperable by design
   ââ   Integrated with European digital identity (eIDAS)
   ââ   Secure, auditable and vendor-independent
7. Pillar II: European Device and Hardware Ecosystem
The EU shall build a European hardware ecosystem including:

   ââ   Phones, laptops, desktops, tablets and edge devices
   ââ   Designed in Europe and increasingly manufactured in Europe
   ââ   Running European open systems by default
   ââ   Fully repairable, sustainable and long-term supported

Key partners: Fairphone, Tuxedo, European OEMs and ODMs.

Distribution shall be ensured via European retail chains such as MediaMarkt, Fnac-Darty
and equivalents.

8. Pillar III: European Sovereign Cloud, Data and AI
Infrastructure
In line with the Commissionâs cloud and AI strategy, the EU shall build:

   ââ A fully sovereign European cloud stack
