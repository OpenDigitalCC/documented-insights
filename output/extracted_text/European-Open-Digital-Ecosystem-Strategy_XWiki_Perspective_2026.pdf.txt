Open Source and Europeâs Digital Competitiveness - Policy perspectives from
XWiki SAS on strategic autonomy and software sovereignty
A foundation for digital strategic autonomy and software sovereignty
At XWiki and CryptPad, based on more than two decades of experience building and sustaining open-source software in Europe, we
observe that open source can play a decisive role in rebuilding Europeâs competitiveness in software and in achieving European digital
strategic autonomy. By enabling all European actors â from software builders to users, across both public and private sectors â to
align around the open-source software delivery model, Europe can regain control over the digital infrastructure used by organizations
and individuals alike.

This document presents the perspective of a 21-year-old open-source company, with extensive experience in building and sustaining
open-source software businesses in Europe. It outlines our analysis and proposals to contribute to the shared European objective of
regaining control over critical digital infrastructure and software ecosystems.

Company Presentation
XWiki SAS is a French-Romanian company with 20 years of experience, providing us with concrete lessons on how open-source
software can be developed, funded, governed, and adopted at scale within the European regulatory, economic, and institutional
context. For over two decades, we have developed the XWiki and CryptPad collaboration solutions, 100% as open source, sustained
exclusively by our business model without any external investor funding. Over the years, we have benefited from significant public
funding, giving us strong experience in how European and French funding for R&D, software, and open source operates in practice.
XWiki is used by thousands of organizations worldwide and competes with dominant players such as Atlassian, Notion, and several
Microsoft services, while offering sovereign solutions that can be self-hosted or deployed in the cloud. CryptPad has high success
in the B2C sector with more 350k monthly users.

This experience provides direct insight into how open-source companies can contribute to European digital sovereignty. Operating
in both public and private sectors, and facing competition from predominantly non-EU, cloud-only providers, has allowed us to
observe first-hand how funding mechanisms, procurement rules, and regulatory choices shape market outcomes. Our main goal has
been to develop open-source software that enhances digital strategic autonomy and sovereignty for governments, businesses, and
individuals. We therefore welcome the European Commissionâs commitment to developing the open-source sector in Europe and are
eager to contribute our expertise to strengthening European digital sovereignty through open-source software and collaboration.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector?
1.1 Strengths
Europe has excellent open-source developers and is a key contributor to open-source software worldwide. Many European developers
have created key software tools such as MySQL/MariaDB, Linux, Nextcloud, XWiki, CryptPad, and e/OS, both within European
companies and in US-based organizations. Additionally, numerous European developers have contributed to major projects like
Android, Linux, and GitLab.

Europe also has a vibrant open-source ecosystem with many activists who see open source as strategic. This ecosystem plays
a critical role in long-term maintenance, rapid security response, and talent retention, as active communities ensure continuity of

expertise and stewardship of key software components over time. The FOSDEM conference is a great example of this thriving
ecosystem and community.

European B2B SMEs have demonstrated that it is possible to successfully grow a company, create skilled jobs, train and develop
new talent, and reinforce European industrial resilience, often without external investment, in a very adverse environment dominated
by Big Tech. Examples include Nextcloud, Vates, Proxmox, Open-Xchange, XWiki, Murena, OpenProject, and Bluemind.

1.2 Weaknesses
For many years, open source has been largely ignored by the business world, while at the same time âopen-source washingâ has
been at work:

a. Open source has not been favored by Tech venture-capital funding

Multiple open-source projects with a priority on business objectives (versus open-source ones) have gone to US-based venture-capital
(VC) firms: MySQL, Nuxeo, Strapi, Talend. Several of these were later acquired by US companies (MySQL, Nuxeo, Talend).
When VC investors go for open-source solutions, there is a strong intention of "open washing" or progressively closing down the
source over the long term.

Venture capital is not the most suitable funding model for open-source companies. In the absence of regulation or strong incentives
to maintain fully open-source offerings, VC funding can create pressure to progressively close open-source strategies in pursuit of
high profit margins. While open source can be profitable, relying solely on this model often leaves incentives to limit openness in
order to maximize returns.

Alternative funding mechanisms that prioritize sustainable, lower-risk growth while supporting open-source principles are therefore
necessary.

b. Regulation and general incentive environment does not favor open source

Large clients and regulators have so far struggled to require strong adoption of "Open Standards" and "Open Source" from dominant
providers, who often pursue bundled offerings (see 3/).

In the private sector, large companies have rarely demanded Open Standards, portability, or de-bundling from their providers. Despite
representing collective spending in the billions of euros, they have not been able to impose these requirements on their suppliers:

   â¢ Use Open Standards and Open Source whenever possible
   â¢ Avoid usage of proprietary and undocumented formats that are stable over time
   â¢ Reduce pricing when not using a subset of the solution in the case of bundles

On the regulatory side, when some regulations have been used, they have been extremely complex and tend to favor large companies
(GDPR, CRA). More robust measures are needed to ensure emerging actors are not hindered. Stronger regulation should require
large companies to:

   â¢ Provide data exports with proper formats
   â¢ Use Open Standards at the core of their systems
   â¢ Allow real-time communication with their platforms
   â¢ Offer de-bundled pricing to enable competition product by product

                                autonomy and software sovereignty

Additionally, stronger incentives are needed for both market providers and regulators:

   â¢ Buy European, buy open source, buy small business, which is also promoted by the EuroStack movement.
   â¢ Scoring systems in public and private tenders that reward resilience and the use of open-source solutions. In this area we
      support the CNLL proposition of the Risk Assessment Framework (a âSovereignty Scorecardâ) or the Digital Resilience Index
      Proposal (https://resiliencenumerique.com/)

Taken together, regulatory complexity, procurement practices, and misaligned incentives shape market outcomes in favor of dominant
incumbents, making it significantly harder for open-source and emerging European actors to compete on equal terms.

2. What are the main barriers that hamper
2.1 Adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source
In addition to the general weaknesses already listed, the following aspects are highly important:

   â¢ Reluctance to change for solutions not 100% matching alternatives

The lack of adoption is due, on one hand, to the reluctance of IT departments to change, and on the other hand, to the difficulty for
open-source solutions to fully match the features of proprietary software - mainly due to a lack of funding.

   â¢ Lack of funding and traditional tech funding not matching the needs of the open-source sector

Funding through VCs, while it could look like a solution, is not adapted to the open-source market (see above). While public funding
through projects is beneficial and has allowed solutions to emerge, the level of funding does not matching the level of cloud funding,
for instance. Both public funding and actual customer-based funding need to be incentivized.

   â¢ Bundle strategy of large players (not specific to open source and relevant to both B2B and B2C)

The bundle strategy of large players allows them to use their dominant position to stifle competition. For a customer, choosing a better
local solution (open source or not) does not change the price paid. Moreover, proprietary formats and the complexity of migration
add additional costs to switching. The only exception is the Teams module in Microsoft 365, which was priced separately following a
complaint by Slack. This needs to be generalized to stop Big Tech such as Microsoft from providing various additional software for
free, when clients are effectively locked into essential tools like email and office suites. Clients should have the ability to switch any
solution for an alternative without being constrained by pricing or bundling strategies.

In the B2C sector, users would like a simple integrated solution. The highly funded proprietary vendors financed by advertisements
have the capacity to provide horizontal solutions matching many needs.

   â¢ European companies and public procurement processes often de-prioritize resilience and regulatory compliance (not specific
      to open source)

Hosting personal data with American companies raises significant GDPR compliance challenges, particularly in relation to data
transfers, access by foreign authorities, and long-term legal certainty. However, even governments try to find loopholes to continue
choosing Microsoft. Resilience is often limited to the hosting location, regardless of the source of the code. Resilience is de-prioritized,
as European companies have always had a high risk of dependence on US software.

   â¢ In the B2C market, competition with "free" solutions, with data-extractive business models

                                 autonomy and software sovereignty

In the B2C market, while open-source solutions can also be "free", if they do as such, editors lack the funding of the alternatives
they compete with. While it's possible to charge for hosting services for consumers, the case of paying needs to be made versus a
hidden payment. GDPR has brought benefits to force companies to explain these hidden services, therefore increasing the value of
solutions not based on extractive data models. However, currently, only a fraction of users are ready to move to paying solutions, for
which the offer is fragmented and also non open-source competitors exist. Open-source providers can charge for hosting but also
compete with their free self-hosted offers.

2.2 Sustainable contributions to open-source communities
Sustainable contributions to open-source communities are directly linked to long-term security, reliability, and resilience outcomes.
Without stable funding and continuous contributor engagement, critical software components risk insufficient maintenance, slower
security patching, and growing technical debt, which ultimately undermines trust and dependability for users across the public and
private sectors.

There are too many 'free riders' in open-source communities, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as "open washing". As the free
rider includes large amounts of open-source code in their offering, it only contributes marginally to the actual open-source software,
and even maintains its own competence and toolset as proprietary. These free riders compete with the actual contributors to the
open-source communities. Customers and public tenders often inadvertently encourage freeriding by prioritizing the lowest price over
contributions to open-source sustainability.

Especially when projects become mature and work very well, the presence of free riders redirects available funding to service
companies instead of to the actual developers of the projects, leading to a lack of maintenance funding. Even initially, most funding
that is provided goes towards innovation and new features, and not towards maintaining open-source projects. Unless developers
form companies and build a business model around their open-source software (which sometimes means adopting open core),
maintenance is heavily underfunded. New regulations such as the Cyber Resilience Act are also increasing the burden on open-
source developers and do not provide them with a way to obtain funding from it, so there is a risk that the situation will become
more difficult.

While other models also exist for sustainable open-source software, companies building products that are 100% open source are,
from our point of view, the most effective method to maximize open-source contributions and ensure sustainability. Customers need
to fund open-source products' R&D and not get everything at the marginal cost of deployment or hardware, as some service or cloud
companies could offer. It is a long-standing misunderstanding that the value of open source is that it should be free of charge, when
the core value is that it is free to analyze and fork. For sustainability, it is important to create a flow of revenue for the actual developers
of the software. Companies that invest in a team of 100% open-source developers should be encouraged and favored. Service and
cloud providers should be required either to partner with companies funding development or to invest massively themselves. Tender
policies should measure the level of mastery of the open-source solution provided and include this in the scoring mechanism.

For end-user or business software, an open-source community will only exist if the companies funding development have a proper
business model, and vice versa. A company having a good business model around open source needs to fund open-source
development.

                                autonomy and software sovereignty

3. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors?
3.1 Mutualization and strategic autonomy at the European level
Only open source will allow each European country to achieve autonomy, while still enabling collaboration with other European
countries to mutualize the effort required. By sharing and co-developing common open-source components, companies can reduce
duplication of work, pool investments on strategic building blocks, and benefit collectively from improvements made by others, without
losing control over their own deployments, local champions, or strategic choices.

3.2 Transparency & Security
The number one value of open source is the right to know what you are running. This is a key requirement of autonomy and
sovereignty. Only open source gives you the possibility of being independent from any provider in the analysis of what you are running.
Transparency increases security. Open source makes it very difficult to include backdoors or highly extractive business models, as
all actions are visible and communities and customers can freely study and verify the code. At the same funding level, open source is
vastly superior to proprietary software in terms of security. However, this does not mean open-source software cannot have security
issues, as many communities do not have enough market share or funding to properly implement the right security processes.

3.3 Lock-in
100% open source, unlike open core or proprietary software, protects the right to change provider. Lack of vendor lock-in is an indirect
value, as it enables the key elements of value: control and cost.

3.4 Control
Open source also protects the right of customers to run the software as they desire. A provider of 100% open source cannot forbid a
customer from using the software on their preferred hosting, allowing complete control of the chain. This control is key for organization's
digital autonomy.

3.5 Competition
Open source encourages competition, as it is possible to fork the software. While this also has some fragmentation effects that are
not beneficial, it guarantees that software can evolve the way customers decide, and not solely as the provider decides. If a provider
decides to move the software in a new direction, competition, including employees leaving, can decide to fork and choose the direction
customers want. Nextcloud has been a positive example of a fork from an initial provider, OwnCloud.

3.6 Cost
From a cost perspective, it is important to distinguish between short-term and long-term dynamics. In the short term, proprietary
and cloud providers often apply aggressive pricing or bundling strategies to attract and lock in customers. Over the long term, open
source is cheaper as it provides better mutualization. However, focusing only on cost risks ignoring the short-term dumping strategy of
proprietary and cloud companies. The typical business model of the tech industry is low initial prices to capture customers, followed by
price increases on the basic product or many hidden options once customers are locked-in. The benefits of mutualization only apply if:

   â¢ The number of customers of the open-source solution reaches a threshold market share (5%)
   â¢ The proprietary entity has stopped a dumping strategy

                                autonomy and software sovereignty

   â¢ The proprietary competitor is not applying a bundle strategy that hides costs in "options"

Medium and long-term costs are protected within open source by the lack of lock-in. Providers that "sell" open source will be challenged
if they exaggerate their pricing, and while they can change prices, customers will be free to leave with the software. With proprietary
solutions, the lack of an available migration path might hinder the capacity to switch.

3.7 Innovation
While the tech industry is considered highly innovative, the goal of commercial companies, especially large or VC-funded ones, is
not to direct innovation toward customer needs, but toward shareholder needs. They privilege innovation that benefits their business
model and higher margins. Currently, AI is being used by proprietary software companies as a way to increase prices. Customers
will have to pay for it, even if they do not see the value (or want the features), and proprietary companies will push solutions that
risk having significant negative value.

At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that a substantial share of AI innovation itself is built on open-source foundations,
including core frameworks, libraries, and research outputs developed by academic institutions, individual researchers, and open-
source communities. These open-source contributions have been instrumental in accelerating innovation across the AI ecosystem
and demonstrate the capacity of open-source models to support cutting-edge technological progress.

A lot of key innovation is made as open source by individuals or researchers and is often captured by proprietary companies. This
has been the case in our field with wikis. While wikis were invented by an individual, Ward Cunningham, in 1995 and popularized by
Wikipedia as open data and open source, the main commercial actors have been Atlassian Confluence and, more recently, Notion,
providing proprietary wiki solutions. Open-source solutions started before, including XWiki, which started the same year as Atlassian
Confluence but could not compete with funding generated via other software products (Atlassian funded their wiki solution from their
Jira tool). Today, as Atlassian turns off on-premise offerings and forces customers onto cloud offers (AWS), customers are seeking
open-source solutions such as XWiki as a long-term option to protect their data.

4. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector?
The measures outlined below are not of equal urgency or impact. Priority should be given to actions that directly address structural
funding gaps, long-term maintenance of critical open-source components, and market incentives that currently disadvantage open-
source solutions. In particular, funding mechanisms and procurement-related measures are likely to have the fastest and most
significant impact, while regulatory and fiscal instruments may require longer-term implementation but offer strong leverage once
in place.

4.1 Amount of funding
Reach a level of funding for open-source software similar to the funding of the cloud or AI sectors.

Cloud and AI funding levels provide a relevant benchmark because open-source software plays a comparable foundational role in
the digital ecosystem. Just as cloud and AI technologies underpin a wide range of digital services, innovation, and economic activity,
open-source software constitutes the core infrastructure on which most modern software stacks are built, including cloud and AI
systems themselves. Aligning funding levels would reflect the systemic importance of open source, its cross-sector impact, and the
need for sustained investment in its development, security, and maintenance.

                                 autonomy and software sovereignty

Existing funding mechanisms specifically dedicated to open source remain limited. Up until now, annual funding of open-source
software has never exceeded â¬100 million.

4.2 Adapt the type of funding to the needs of the open-source sector

a. Cascade funding (implemented in Next Generation Internet), also in Open Internet Stack

XWiki and CryptPad have both benefited from cascade funding through Next Generation Internet (NGI) and NLNet. We have found
the cascade funding system to be a highly effective way of funding the actual development of open-source software. It imposes low
administrative overheads for projects and low levels of extra activities not directly benefiting the project itself. This stands in significant
contrast to Horizon research collaboration projects, which, while they can provide funding, tend to modify the mission of the project
to better fit the call and the partners involved. Also, significantly less money goes to development in these projects.

b. Larger and longer-term project funding for projects with a strong track record

A type of funding that is missing is the ability to bring funding to larger projects with a stronger track record, which can still stay aligned
with their core goals. These would be larger, one-time cascade funding grants for projects that can show a track record with real
usage but have not yet reached financial sustainability on their own. This type of funding could bring three-year funding visibility,
allowing long-term hiring.

c. EU Sovereign Tech Fund

A dedicated fund for maintaining libraries and core software would significantly increase long-term funding. It would also address a
common problem where projects feel compelled to prioritize new features over reliability and security.

The model of the German Sovereign Tech Fund is a strong one. This could also complement the European Digital Infrastructure
Consortium (EDIC), for which the funding model and approach are not yet known. We believe it is important to focus not only on
libraries but also on widely used open-source software, such as core collaboration tools, which face strong competition from dominant
players.

In the governance of Open Source Funds, it is highly important to include actors with strong knowledge of the needs of users, the
technology as available today, the current open source ecosystem and how open-source technologies are build and companies run.
It might be necessary to have different funds for different technology areas, as for instance cloud expertise is very different from
collaboration tools. Moreover, end user applications is very different from low level libraries used by developers. This experience is
critical to optimize the investments towards solutions that can strive in the market.

Funding could also include bug bounties or paid security or accessibility analyses, as has been done before, but should always include
funding for developers to actually fix the results of the analyses. As a company that has received bug bounties, which we highly
appreciated, we have also seen that they created specific pressure to focus on these issues yet without providing proper funding.
This creates high pressure on teams, as it was not possible to stop other funded activities such as other projects or customer work.

4.3 Preference for local open source
In this context, âlocalâ should be understood as referring primarily to European Unionâbased open-source software and providers. It
should also allow Member States to further prioritize national or regional actors where relevant and compatible with EU procurement
rules.

                                autonomy and software sovereignty

Promote and incentivize resilience and local open source through a set of measures:

     â¢ Buy European act: any European level buying would improve the situation, including for local open-source actors
     â¢ The following initiative (https://resiliencenumerique.com/) of an Digital Resilience Index for companies is an interesting start,
       encouraging companies to question their own resiliency
     â¢ Creating labels for resilient software which includes open source as a positive criteria would also help local open-source actors.
     â¢ Cybersecurity requirements including open source as a key criteria (or at a minimum shared source)
     â¢ Public procurement making open source the default, or at a minimum providing higher scores for open-source software. The
       criteria should include participation to the open-source communities or contractualization with the actual developers of the
       software
     â¢ Forcing a minimal percentage of local buying and open-source buying
     â¢ Tax cuts for companies deploying open-source technologies
     â¢ Mandate public projects creating code, to produce only public code (Public Money Public Code)
     â¢ Mandate total cost of ownership (TCO) calculation including exit costs

4.4 Include a preference for providers contributing to open source
To avoid freeriding, which reduces funding for the actual developers of open-source software, it is necessary that any provider
including open-source components also either:

     â¢ Actively contribute at a significant level to the open-source software.

or

     â¢ Collaborate directly with the original developers, providing commercial services and employing developers who work on the
       software.

The preference can be included in tender offer rules through a specific scoring which measures the provider's contribution to the
open-source software being proposed.
An allotment strategy could also be implemented to assign a part of the open source project contracts to software subscriptions or
support towards vendors investing in open source.

4.5 Regulatory actions
Regulate large software vendors, while protecting smaller vendors. This should include extending DMA and DSA regulation:

     â¢ to more large actors (the limits seem currently quite high, allowing many actors to try to avoid the constraints)
     â¢ to cover more areas, such as bundling strategies in the Cloud and Digital Workplace sector, for instance

Additionally, regulatory burden should be reduced for smaller actors, including open source actors. The CRA is still unclear in terms
of implementation for small business actors providing open-source solutions for free, while building a business strategy.

4.6 Software tax for open source
This proposal is intentionally exploratory and would require careful assessment of feasibility, scope, and governance to avoid
unintended effects on innovation or competitiveness. Alternative or complementary mechanisms could include mandatory contribution

schemes tied to procurement, sector-specific levies, voluntary contribution frameworks with strong incentives, or expanded public
funding dedicated to long-term maintenance of critical open-source components.

Almost all softwares are using some open-source software, but many of the open-source components are lacking maintenance
funding. Security requirements on these open-source components are increasing, in particular with the Cyber Resilience Act. Some
actors are voluntarily deciding to fund the components that are used in their software, however it's rarely proportional to the revenue
of the companies are getting out of these software, with a significant inequality between actors.

By applying a tax on software (for example 1% or 2%), which would be then used to fund the maintenance of open-source components,
there would be a direct funding going towards maintenance. This could fund the European Sovereign Tech Fund, the EDIC or other
funds dedicated to maintenance of open-source software.

5. What technology areas should be prioritized and why?
5.1. Collaborative and productivity software ecosystems
Collaborative software matching the Microsoft 365 and Atlassian offerings, and other innovative cloud solutions.

These tools are at the core of daily digital work for public administrations, companies, and individuals. Prioritizing open-source
alternatives in this area is essential to reduce dependency on dominant non-European providers, avoid lock-in, and ensure long-term
control over data, hosting, and evolution of features.

a. Open-source components for collaboration

These libraries are foundational building blocks reused across many products. Investing at this level allows strong mutualization,
faster innovation, and better security through reuse and peer review.

   â¢ Office editor components compatible with Office formats
      Compatibility with existing Office formats is critical to reduce switching costs and enable progressive migration from proprietary
      solutions without breaking existing workflows. In this area each provider wanting to provide collaboration tools compatible with
      OOXML/OpenDocument formats is lacking proper modern day libraries that can be integrated in their software. They end up
      trying to redevelop partial solutions.
   â¢ Decentralized technologies and libraries
      Decentralized approaches reduce single points of failure, improve resilience, and allow federated or self-hosted deployments
      aligned with European sovereignty requirements.
   â¢ Open standards implementation libraries
      High-quality implementations of open standards ensure interoperability between solutions, reduce lock-in, and enable a
      competitive ecosystem of interchangeable providers.

b. Open-source collaboration products led by 100% open-source companies

Supporting full products developed by companies fully committed to open source ensures sustainable funding for development,
maintenance, and security, while keeping control in the hands of users and communities.

                                autonomy and software sovereignty

c. Open source end-to-end encrypted collaboration software for the B2C market

These solutions are key to protecting citizensâ privacy, enabling secure personal communications and collaboration without reliance
on data-extractive business models.

d. Integrations between open-source software, allowing more integrated offerings

Strong integration between open-source tools is necessary to offer coherent alternatives to proprietary suites and to improve usability
and adoption.

5.2. Mobile devices and operating systems
Control over mobile operating systems and devices is critical, as they are primary access points to digital services. Open-source
mobile stacks increase transparency, security, and strategic autonomy. In addition, strong dependencies on proprietary app stores
and tightly controlled mobile ecosystems create significant sovereignty risks, as they limit the ability of European actors to distribute
applications freely, impose unilateral technical or commercial constraints, and concentrate control over user access and data in the
hands of a few non-European platforms.

5.3. Open-source cloud software stacks
Open-source cloud software stacks matching AWS/Azure offerings.

Open-source cloud infrastructures enable European actors to build sovereign cloud services, avoid dependency on hyperscalers,
and ensure compliance with European regulations.

5.4. Security libraries and tool-chains
Security components are foundational to all software. Prioritizing Open-source security libraries allows auditability, faster vulnerability
detection, shared maintenance, and higher trust across the ecosystem.

6. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
competitiveness and cyber resilience?
6.1 Competitiveness
While increased use of open-source software can bring value to any sector of the European economy, there are particular areas
where the benefits of open-source software can be most effective:

   â¢ Public Administration and Government Services

As the cost of running the public administration is a key challenge, governments have strong reasons to mutualize work through
open source. They can share with other European governments and create additional value if local actors benefit from their initial
work. Procurement of open-source solutions by the public sector - provided they are sourced from companies that also offer products
ready for the private sector - can help increase the competitiveness of open-source vendors. It can also accelerate market adoption
across broader markets.

   â¢ Military and Security

                                 autonomy and software sovereignty

Open-source technologies brings transparency and these sector can rely more on open source software which has been properly
audited. Open source will allow providers to be highly competitive.

    â¢ High Tech and Automotive

In automobile and similar industries, in an age where software technologies are becoming more and more important, as they become
a key part of the product, open source is key to the competitiveness of the products build by the industry. Cars integrate Android or
Apple technologies in their cars. Open source can help European companies taking back control and innovate in this area to keep
the leadership positions they have in the industry.

    â¢ Healthcare

Security and privacy are paramount in the healthcare sector. Data must be protected from companies that provide insufficient
safeguards or face transnational security vulnerabilities. By adopting open-source solutions, healthcare providers can strengthen data
privacy, security, and overall trust.

    â¢ Education

Education is a key sector, as it plays a crucial role in preparing talent for open source. Currently, many educational institutions promote
proprietary solutions to students, creating early dependencies before they enter the professional world. By using and promoting open-
source solutions in education, we can ensure that future talent is ready to adopt and work with open-source alternatives

    â¢ Climate transition

Open source can bring significant value to environmental sustainability by providing software with lower running costs and extending
the lifespan of hardware.

6.2 Cyber Resilience
    â¢ IT Collaboration Services

Currently, the IT services sector is dominated by Microsoft, which creates a huge security and sovereignty liability.

    â¢ Cloud Providers

Open source is a key enabler for resilient cloud infrastructures by reducing dependency on proprietary hyperscaler technologies. It
allows cloud providers to build interoperable, auditable, and portable stacks, improves transparency of the infrastructure layer, and
enables faster collective responses to vulnerabilities across the ecosystem.

    â¢ Security & Military Sector, Public Sector

These sectors face high threats related to espionage, sabotage, and strategic dependency. Increased use of open source improves
auditability, reduces the risk of hidden backdoors, and allows full control over deployment, maintenance, and incident response. It
also enables cooperation between public actors and trusted local industry for long-term resilience.

The public sector faces a risk of service disruption scenarios linked to potential killâswitch mechanisms embedded in foreign-controlled
software ecosystems.

    â¢ Cloud Providers

   â¢ Individual users

For individual users, open source improves cyber resilience by enabling transparency, user control, and alternatives to data-extractive
business models. Secure open-source applications, including end-to-end encrypted tools, reduce exposure to mass surveillance,
large-scale data breaches, and unilateral changes imposed by dominant platforms.
