Submission Proposal: The "Single Digital API"
Regime
By Benoit Vandevivere

Unlocking the Single Market: A Unified Open Source API Layer for European
Competitiveness

   1. The Problem: The "Integration Tax" on European Innovation

While the EU functions as a Single Market legally, it remains 27 distinct digital
markets technologically. Currently, a European SaaS, Fintech, or RegTech
company wishing to operate cross-border must build integrations for 27 different
"technological stacks" for mandatory interactions (VAT, social security, corporate
tax, company registries, KYC).

This fragmentation creates a massive barrier to entry and scale. Unlike in the US,
where a startup scales instantly across 50 states using unified standards,
European innovators face exponential development costs for each new Member
State they enter. This forces EU companies to remain local/regional, while foreign
giants with deeper pockets capture the market.

   2. The Solution: An Open Source "28th Regime" for Digital Administration

The "European Open Digital Ecosystem" initiative must go beyond simple software
sharing; it must mandate a Unified Open Source Interface Layer.

   â¢   Concept: The EU should fund and maintain an open-source set of
       standardized APIs and protocols for all mandatory B2G (Business-to-
       Government) interactions.
   â¢   Mechanism: Member States would retain their sovereignty over backend
       legacy systems but would be required to expose their services through this
       unified, open-source adapter layer.
   â¢   Result: A developer in Estonia could write code for e-invoicing or payroll
       automation once using the EU Open Standard, and that code would legally
       and technically function for a client in France, Germany, or Spain.
   â¢   Economic Impact:

This transforms Open Source from a technical preference into an economic
multiplier. It allows European startups to "code once, deploy everywhere,"
drastically reducing the friction of cross-border trade. It effectively creates a digital
"28th Regime"âa virtual jurisdiction where technology scales frictionlessly,
enabling European champions to grow efficiently.

The Future-Proofing: An "AI-First" Strategy
Headline: Preparing for the Age of AI Agents and Automated Compliance

   1. From Human-Centric to Agent-Centric Design

Current government digitalization often replicates paper processes on a screen
(PDFs, web forms), designed for human eyes. However, the immediate future of
administration is Agentic AIâwhere AI agents act on behalf of companies to
handle routine compliance (VAT filings, registry updates, audit trails).

   2. Machine-to-Government (M2G) Protocols

Our Open Source strategy must be "AI-First." This means defining standardized,
machine-readable protocols (not just visual interfaces) that allow AI agents to
securely authenticate, query, and file obligations without human intervention.

   â¢   Standardization: By defining these protocols at the EU level now, we
       prevent a future where 27 different "AI adaptors" are needed.
   â¢   Certainty: Open source code provides the transparency needed for
       algorithmic accountability, ensuring that an AI agent's filing is legally valid
       and traceable.
   â¢   The Vision

By building an API-first, AI-ready infrastructure, Europe can leapfrog legacy
digitization and become the worldâs first "Programmatic Jurisdiction." This attracts
global business by making compliance a background software process rather than
a bureaucratic hurdle.

Legal Infrastructure: Bringing Digital Governance
Home**
   1. The Problem: The "Legal Exile" of European Code

Despite being developed in Europe, the governance of major open source projects
overwhelmingly takes place in the United States (typically as Delaware 501(c)(3) or
501(c)(6) non-profits).

Benoit Vandevivere
   â¢   Why: Europe lacks a harmonized, cross-border legal structure for open-
       source foundations. A foundation established in France or Germany faces
       bureaucratic hurdles when accepting tax-deductible donations from other
       Member States or hiring contributors across borders.
   â¢   Consequence: European projects incorporate in the US to access a stable,
       recognized legal framework and standardized IP management. This results
       in a loss of digital sovereignty, as the ultimate legal stewardship of
       "European" infrastructure remains under US jurisdiction and subject to US
       export control laws.
   â¢   The Solution: A "European Digital Foundation" Status

To repatriate the governance of our digital commons, the EU must establish a
specialized European Digital Foundation legal entity (or distinct status within the
European Association statute).

   â¢   Features: This status must offer automatic mutual recognition of non-
       profit/tax-exempt status across all 27 Member States, simplified cross-
       border employment of maintainers, and standardized templates for IP
       asset holding.
   â¢   Goal: Make Europe the most attractive jurisdiction globally for hosting
       open-source governance, ensuring that the software powering our public
       administrations remains legally anchored in Europe.
