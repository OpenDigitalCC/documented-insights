                        European Open Digital Ecosystems â Call for Evidence

                                       IP Unit â CRIDS â UNamuri

        1. The IP Unit of the Research Center in Information, Law and Society (CRIDS)ii at the Law
           Faculty of UNamur (Belgium) welcomes the Commissionâs âEuropean Open Digital
           Ecosystem Strategyâ, which aims to foster the broader adoption and development of
           openâsource solutions across the Union by identifying the barriers currently hindering the
           EUâs openâsource potential and proposing solutions to remove them.

        2. In this regard, based on our experience as legal researchers and practitioners specialised
           in intellectual property and digital law, we would like to highlight the legal uncertainty
           surrounding certain open-source licences as a concrete barrier to wider adoption and
           industrial deployment of open-source software in the EU. In practice, some of the most
           widely used licences - in particular strong copyleft licences such as the GNU GPL - raise
           complex interpretative issues that are difficult to assess with sufficient certainty in real-
           world settings. Determining whether the copyleft (âviralâ) effect is triggered can be
           challenging where multiple components under different licences interact in indirect
           or layered ways (e.g. via APIs, services, or embedded systems), without clear code
           incorporation.

        3. For instance, regarding the GPL (one of the most widely used open-source license), legal
           assessments may reasonably diverge on whether a component constitutes a âcovered
           workâ (GPLv3) or a âwork based on the Programâ (GPLv2). Similarly, the notion of
           âdistributionâ (GPLv2) or âconveyingâ (GPLv3) is not always clear in practice, for example
           where software is installed on devices provided by a licensee but used or accessed by
           subcontractors or partners. These uncertainties have concrete consequences in areas
           such as IP due diligence, public procurement and compliance assessments, and may
           lead either to excessive risk aversion or to unintentional non-compliance.

        4. By contrast, the European Union Public Licence (EUPL) appears to provide greater legal
           clarity from a drafting perspective, yet it remains relatively underused, possibly due to
           limited awareness among developers and companies.

        5. Improving legal clarity around the scope and effects of commonly used open-source
           licences - for example through guidance, best practices or reference interpretations -
           would help market participants make informed choices and reduce adoption barriers,
           without interfering with the open-source licensing model itself. This would meaningfully
           support the development and scaling of the EU open-source ecosystem. Since the open-
           source community is mainly driven by non-lawyers, such awareness initiatives should
           mainly focus on software developers in order to significantly reduce the occurrence of
           problematic use of open-source components.
