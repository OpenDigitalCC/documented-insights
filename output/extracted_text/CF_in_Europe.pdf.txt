             Cloud Foundry in Europe â The Rabobank perspective

             Rabobankâs LargeâScale Use of Cloud Foundry
             Rabobank relies on Cloud Foundry as a core component of its digital platform. The bank runs about 1,650
             production applications on it across many engineering groups. Cloud Foundry provides a secure, compliant,
             and predictable platform that allows large development teams to focus on business value rather than
             infrastructure. Its portability, consistency, and strong securityâbyâdefault model have made it suitable for
             longâterm use in a highly regulated environment. Rabobankâs multiâyear experience demonstrates that
             openâsource platforms can handle missionâcritical workloads at enterprise scale in Europe.

             Strengths and Weaknesses of the European OpenâSource Landscape
             The Cloud Foundry community shows that Europe has deep engineering expertise. The projectâs Technical
             Oversight Committee has a European majority, including representatives from Rabobank and SAP,
             underscoring the regionâs leadership in technical decisionâmaking. Openâsource ecosystems in Europe are also
             closely aligned with EU values such as transparency, interoperability, and digital autonomy.

             However, strategic and financial governance often remain fragile. In Cloud Foundryâs case, the Foundation
             depends on only two Platinum Members: SAP in Europe and Broadcom in the United States. Platinum
             membership includes a board seat and costs 500,000 USD per year. This narrow base results in
             disproportionate strategic influence for a single nonâEU corporation. The challenge is not engineering capacity,
             which Europe already has, but the concentration of strategic power at the foundation level.

             Another practical weakness is that the Foundationâs budget is consumed largely by CI pipelines, release
             infrastructure, and integration testing. These systems ensure that every Cloud Foundry user receives hardened,
             vendorâneutral release artifacts. But because the Foundation cannot fund maintainers, its longâterm stability
             depends heavily on sponsors, making governance diversity critical.

             Value of Open Source for Europe
             Rabobankâs experience illustrates the broader benefits of open source. Cloud Foundry reduces operational
             costs, avoids vendor lockâin, accelerates development cycles, and simplifies compliance. These same qualities
             benefit public administrations, telecom operators, manufacturers, and other regulated industries. Open
             platforms give organisations control over where and how they run workloads, strengthening sovereignty and
             resilience.

             How the EU Can Strengthen OpenâSource Sovereignty
             The most impactful action the EU could take is to participate directly in the strategic governance of key
             openâsource foundations. For Cloud Foundry specifically, the European Commission becoming a Platinum
             Sponsor would immediately rebalance governance, reduce dependence on a single US sponsor, and secure
             funding for essential shared infrastructure. Because Europe already provides excellent engineering talent,
             strategic sponsorship would complement existing strengths without replacing community contributions.

             Broader Sectoral Impact
             Sectors such as finance, government, telecommunications, healthcare, and manufacturing would all benefit
             from openâsource systems that remain neutral, wellâfunded, and strategically aligned with European interests.
             Strengthening governance in foundational projects like Cloud Foundry is essential to improving
             competitiveness, ensuring cyber resilience, and safeguarding Europeâs digital autonomy.
