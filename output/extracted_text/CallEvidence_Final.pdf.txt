1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source
sector? What are the main barriers that hamper
(i) adop>on and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source;
and (ii) sustainable contribu>ons to open-source communi>es?
The EU open-source sector benefits from a robust developer and research ecosystem that
actively contributes to major global open-source projects, supported by open science and open
access policies. Europe also shows strong coordination capacity: European OSS infrastructure
initiatives such as those reflected in the ECS SRIA and RISC-V roadmaps demonstrate the
ability to align research, industry and public actors around shared technological priorities and
open standards, positioning open source as a lever for interoperability, sovereignty and long-
term resilience. In addition, Europe has demonstrated legal and policy capacity to design EU-
law-aligned OSS instruments, such as the EUPL, which is particularly suited to certain public-
sector contexts.

However, the main weaknesses are structural rather than technical.

Weaknesses

   â¢   Structural dependence on short-term, project-based funding (e.g. research grants and
       pilots), with limited capacity for long-term maintenance, security and evolution beyond
       project lifecycles.

   â¢   Fragmented or unclear governance and stewardship, often left to temporary consortia
       that adopt conservative, low-commitment strategies.

   â¢   Limited adoption engineering, including insufficient tooling, packaging, documentation
       and integration into dominant global ecosystems.

   â¢   Weak alignment between OSS outputs and public procurement or industrial deployment
       pathways.

   â¢   Heavy reliance on non-EU platforms and infrastructure (e.g. GitHub/GitLab, CI/CD
       pipelines, container registries, cloud services), raising risks for resilience and European
       digital sovereignty.

A major barrier to both sustainability and community contribution and adoption is Europeâs:

   â¢   structural shortage of non-profit associations with the mandate and capacity to establish
       robust governance models, ensure long-term maintenance of OSS codebases, and attract
       sustained public and private investment (including follow-up investment for Horizon-
       funded outputs). While notable exceptions existâsuch as Linux Foundation Europeâ
       these remain insufficient given the scale and diversity of Europeâs OSS landscape.
â¢   poor ecosystem incentives, network effects around dominant licences, and weak
    governance and sustainability mechanisms, as shown by the limited uptake of the EUPL,
    illustrate that adoption barriers are not primarily legal. Addressing these barriers requires
    stronger aggregating structures and long-term support mechanisms, including the
    promotion of new non-profit OSS associations through publicâprivate partnerships and the
    strengthening of sectoral organisations (e.g., energy, mobility, health, manufacturing) to
    coordinate contributions from industry and academia, reduce fragmentation, and provide
    credible frameworks for long-term funding.
2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private
sectors? Please provide concrete examples, including the factors (such
as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innova>on, among others) that are most
important to assess the added value.

Open source creates significant added value for both public and private sectors by enabling
interoperability, reducing dependency on proprietary vendors, lowering switching costs, fostering
innovation, and strengthening transparency and security.
    â¢ For public administrations, open source supports auditability, long-term control over
       critical digital assets, and cross-border reuse of publicly funded solutions.
    â¢ For private actors, particularly SMEs and start-ups, it lowers entry barriers to complex
       value chains and enables innovation on top of shared, non-competitive infrastructure.

Concrete examples illustrate how this value materialises in practice.

   â   Common European Data Spaces, where reusable open-source components from
       initiatives such as the Eclipse Dataspace Components, reduce implementation costs, limit
       fragmentation, and lay the foundations for the development of interoperable European
       sovereign data-sharing ecosystems;
   â   Open geospatial standards acceptance and implementation are strengthened through
       tools such as PygeoAPI and Zoo-project, which widen the OGC standards suite and
       enable added-value, scalable applications;
   â   In cloud and storage environments, open APIs like the S3 interface are supported by open-
       source implementations such as MinIO, reduce vendor lock-in while preserving
       compatibility with dominant ecosystems;
   â   Open source also underpins core digital infrastructure through widely used technologies
       such as RabbitMQ for messaging, GitLab for collaboration, and container ecosystems
       including Docker Engine, Kubernetes, and related components that form the backbone of
       modern computing.

These technologies reduce operational risk, accelerate innovation cycles, and improve security
through transparency and collective code review. OSS can significantly reduce vendor lock-in
while promoting the adoption and evolution of open standards, creating clear added value for
both public and private sectors. It enables shared ownership of core digital infrastructure, lowers
switching costs, and increases interoperability. A concrete example:

   â¢   as Linux Foundation Energyâs Everest (https://lfenergy.org/projects/everest/) demonstrate
       how open-source implementations of standards (e.g. OCPP, ISO 15118) enable vendor-
       neutral electric vehicle charging infrastructure, reducing lock-in, accelerating market
       adoption, and supporting fair competition while ensuring that publicly funded infrastructure
       remains interoperable and future-proof.
Recent cases such as DeepSeek further show that the added value of open source extends
beyond cost savings to include market-shaping power and deployment sovereignty. By releasing
open weights and enabling local hosting, fine-tuning and reuse, adoption expanded from simple
âuseâ to integration and downstream innovation, allowing de facto standards to emerge.

In practice, four factors are decisive when assessing added value:

   â¢   legal reusability (licensing that enables reuse),
   â¢   integration readiness (compatibility with existing stacks),
   â¢   performance transparency (credible benchmarks and documentation),
   â¢   deployability (on-premise and cloud options).

However, the European experience also highlights a recurring limitation: open source is often
promoted without an explicit architecture for value creation, governance and risk control. Licences
alone do not ensure adoption, sustainability or resilience. Open source delivers lasting public and
private value only when combined with services, deployment capacity, governance structures,
maintenance mechanisms, and clearly defined access and usage conditions. Without these
elements, economic and strategic value frequently materialises outside Europe, despite
European investment in the underlying technologies.
3. What concrete measures and ac>ons may be taken at EU level to
support the development and growth of the EU open-source sector
and contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and
cybersecurity agenda?
To unlock the full potential of open source in support of Europeâs technological sovereignty and
cybersecurity objectives, EU action must move beyond funding the creation of open artefacts and
address the full lifecycle of open digital infrastructure. Experience from European OSS initiatives
and recent adoption cases shows that coordination and R&D funding alone are insufficient to
ensure adoption, sustainability and value retention. Concrete measures are therefore required to
strengthen governance, reduce structural dependencies, support long-term maintenance and
enable real deployment at scale.

Treat strategic OSS as European digital public infrastructure (lifecycle, not projects)

   â¢   Dedicated funding streams for OSS development and maintenance that resulted from
       EU funding mechanisms such as FP9-FP10. Shift from project-bound outputs to lifecycle
       funding: maintenance, security updates, bug fixing, documentation, industrialisation,
       release engineering, CI/CD hardening, and community management (including beyond
       the grant period).
   â¢   Require post-project stewardship with clear ownership, accountability and transition
       funding (12â24 months) to avoid âend-of-grantâ abandonment.
   â¢   Use industry co-funding mechanisms where appropriate to reinforce sustainability.

Governance as a mandatory deliverable in infrastructure calls

   â¢   For calls aiming to build digital infrastructure, require an explicit Open Source Strategy +
       Governance Plan upfront (not left to consortia).
   â¢   Promote durable stewardship models (e.g., trusted non-profit associations / sectoral
       organisations) to reduce fragmentation and coordinate long-term contributions.
   â¢   Strengthen and leverage existing organisations (e.g., Linux Foundation Europe) and
       support sectoral governance structures (energy, mobility, health, manufacturing).
   â¢

Fund âadoption-first open releasesâ and reduce adoption friction

   â¢   Explicitly fund adoption engineering as eligible cost: packaging, tooling, integration into
       dominant ecosystems, reference deployments, deployment recipes, and developer
       experience.
   â¢   Require rigorous evaluation and reproducible reporting, alongside documentation that
       enables third-party reuse.
   â¢   Recognise that value capture often occurs downstream (deployment, services,
       certification, sector-specific solutions) and adjust instruments accordingly.
Sovereign European tooling and platforms for the OSS lifecycle

   â¢   Invest in reliable, resilient and cost-effective European cloud infrastructures,
       including federated deployment models (âEuropean cloud of cloudsâ logic).
   â¢   Provide and actively disseminate European-made tools supporting the OSS lifecycle
       (development, collaboration, maintenance, deployment).
   â¢   Reduce reliance on non-EU platforms by strengthening EU-aligned alternatives and
       ecosystems (e.g., Forgejo, Codeberg), while keeping interoperability with global tooling.
   â¢   Build European capabilities for repositories, CI/CD, registries and distribution
       infrastructure as strategic dependencies.

Cybersecurity-by-design for OSS (compliance, SBOM, provenance)

   â¢   Establish EU-level baseline requirements for OSS security and compliance, including:
          o SBOM/provenance expectations,
          o vulnerability disclosure/handling processes,
          o security hardening and long-term patching.
   â¢   Support shared European infrastructure for compliance and security services, and link
       these requirements to funding and procurement.

OSS-aware procurement and public-sector absorption

   â¢   Align public procurement and public-sector pilots with EU-funded OSS so that solutions
       are adopted, sustained and improved in real operational settings.
   â¢   Use procurement criteria that value governance, maintenance commitments, security
       processes and interoperabilityâensuring publicly funded infrastructure remains reusable
       and future-proof.

Strategic dependency mapping and targeted investment

   â¢   Identify widely used OSS dependencies in critical sectors (energy, health, government,
       finance), including dependencies on non-EU software and platforms.
   â¢   Fund alternatives and continuity plans through trusted governance structures and long-
       term investment models.

Avoid licence-centric policy; enable strategy-centric licensing

   â¢   The EUPL experience shows that creating or promoting a specific European licence is not
       sufficient to drive adoption.
   â¢   EU action should not prescribe a single licence; instead, require projects to justify licensing
       choices strategically (reuse, governance, sustainability) and ensure compatibility with
       intended deployment and ecosystem goals.

Support secure decentralised and privacy-preserving infrastructures

   â¢   Encourage experimentation and scaling of distributed, privacy-preserving internet
       infrastructure as part of the cybersecurity and sovereignty agenda (e.g., decentralised
       architectures with encryption and trust mechanisms), particularly for sensitive domains
       such as AI and health.

Address dual-use / sensitive contexts with layered controls

   â¢   Recognise that licences alone do not address dual-use or export-control constraints.
   â¢   Promote governance and contractual/access layers (service terms, deployment controls,
       stewardship) to manage risk while keeping core components open where appropriate.
4. What technology areas should be priori>sed and why?
A primary concern is Europeâs reliance on non-EU platforms for software collaboration and
distribution. Developing and promoting European-based open-source infrastructures for code
hosting, CI/CD, registries, and community coordination is essential to improve resilience and
autonomy.

Another priority, in line with the European Chips Act, is to prioritise open-source chip design and
Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, which are important for Europeâs long-term
competitiveness in semiconductor innovation, education, and industrial capacity.

A greater focus on developer experience and sustainability tooling is also needed, particularly
on solutions that reduce the cost of producing and maintaining high-quality software
documentation. Tools that keep documentation aligned with evolving codebases, architectures,
and deployment environments can significantly improve OSS adoption and long-term
maintainability.

Finally, a strategic priority is the development of a European Cloud of Clouds: a federated,
interoperable, and trusted cloud ecosystem aligned with Gaia-X and EOSC to support public
services, research, and defence needs, and to strengthen Europeâs digital sovereignty by
reducing dependence on non-EU providers.
5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to
increased compe>>veness and cyber resilience?
An increased use of open source can significantly enhance competitiveness and cyber resilience
in sectors where interoperability, long lifecycles, transparency and control over critical digital
assets are essential. In these domains, open source reduces vendor lock-in, enables shared
development of non-competitive components, improves auditability and security, and strengthens
Europeâs ability to deploy and evolve technology locally.

Energy and critical infrastructures are a prime example. Open-source implementations of widely
used standards (e.g. IEC 61850, IEC 60870-5-104, CIM, OCPP, ISO 15118) enable
interoperability across grid operators, EV charging operators, DER aggregators and industrial
users. The Linux Foundation Energy ecosystem illustrates this impact, with projects such as
SOGNO (https://lfenergy.org/projects/sogno/) for open distribution management systems and the
Semantic Energy Framework (https://lfenergy.org/projects/semantic-energy-framework-sef/)
enabling semantic interoperability across smart homes, buildings, grids and IoT. By sharing
foundational components, organisations can focus investment on differentiation rather than
rebuilding the same infrastructure, improving resilience and competitiveness.

Industry, manufacturing and mobility (including automotive and robotics) also benefit strongly
from open source due to long-lived systems and complex supply chains. Open-source stacks
enable multi-vendor integration, reduce systemic risk and support fair competition. In electric
mobility, the EVerest stack (https://lfenergy.org/projects/everest/) provides a vendor-neutral
implementation of EV charging standards, accelerating adoption while ensuring publicly funded
infrastructure remains interoperable and future-proof.

Public administration and GovTech benefit from open source where transparency, auditability and
long-term control of digital services are required. OSS enables cross-border reuse of public-sector
solutions, reduces lock-in and strengthens trust, particularly when combined with governance and
sustained maintenance. Similarly, regulated and security-sensitive sectors such as health and
finance can leverage open source to improve interoperability and local deployment control,
provided that compliance, security and governance practices are enforced.

High-performance computing (HPC), cloud and digital infrastructure are strategic areas where
open source underpins core components of modern computing stacks. Increased European
control over these layers supports federated, interoperable infrastructures and reduces
dependency on non-EU platforms, strengthening cyber resilience. Recent cases such
as DeepSeek further illustrate the importance of open source in contexts requiring controlled
deployment and local adaptation, where open releases can enable ecosystem formation and de
facto standardisation beyond simple âuseâ.
Beyond these areas, open source is also impactful in open-source hardware and
semiconductors (including RISC-V and open EDA tools), which are increasingly important for
industrial competitiveness, education and supply-chain security; in ocean-related
sectors (fisheries, marine energy, biodiversity monitoring and tourism), where interoperable
platforms support sustainable innovation; in space-related sectors, improving robustness and
collaboration in mission-critical systems; and in agriculture, where open digital tools support
productivity and sustainability in rural economies. Research, education, transport and
logistics also benefit from open platforms that accelerate skills development and support
interoperable, resilient infrastructures.

Across all these sectors, the benefits of open source are not automatic. Competitiveness and
cyber resilience increase only when OSS is combined with sustained governance, long-term
maintenance, security practices and deployment capacity. Without these elements, reliance on
open source may shift risks rather than reduce them, underscoring the need to treat OSS as long-
term digital infrastructure rather than a short-term project outcome.
