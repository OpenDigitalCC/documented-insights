                                1. Who we are

                                Our company OC Open Consulting SB srl (further referred as OC) is a
                                European âopen source e-learning and knowledge infrastructureâ company
                                with over 20 years of experience in the adoption, development and long-term
                                governance of open source platforms.

                                We are listed in Italy as a âbenefitâ company operating for the improvement of
                                environment, both for employees and the society.

                                OC is an official service provider of ILIAS, an European open source learning
                                and    knowledge   platform   widely   adopted     by   public   administrations,
                                universities, research organisations and defense institutions. ILIAS is the
                                official LMS of NATO.

                                In this report we will make reference to our 20 years experience in open
                                source e-learning projects, and give some suggestion based on our
                                knowledge management experiences.

                                OC is an active member of the ILIAS open source community, which brings
                                together a wide European network of organisations and professionals
                                collaborating on the development, governance and sustainable evolution of
                                the platform.

                                This community-based model represents a key strength of ILIAS, ensuring
                                resilience, scalability and long-term continuity beyond single vendors or
                                projects.

                       Operating across Europe and TÃ¼rkiye, with also customers in America and
                       Asia, OC supports large-scale and mission-critical deployments that require
                       not only software development, but also governance, security, interoperability,
                       compliance, training and long-term sustainability. Ãand all this is made with
                       open source software only.

                       Our team of 15 professionals delivers end-to-end services including cloud and
                       on-premise deployments, custom development, strategic consulting, content
                       production, and communication and dissemination within complex EU-funded
                       projects.

                       Our work sits at the intersection of digital policy, education and skills, research
                       and innovation, and institutional capacity building, where open source
                       software functions as a strategic enabler rather than a standalone technical
                       choice.

                       2. Evidence from the field: open source as European knowledge infrastructure

                       Based on our operational experience in the e-learning field, European open
                       source software creates its greatest value when it is designed and governed
                       as shared knowledge infrastructure.

                       In our projects, ILIAS is used not only as a Learning Management System, but
                       also as:

                       â¢ a content and document management system,

                       â¢ a repository for institutional and project knowledge,

                       â¢ a platform for internal and external communication,

                       â¢ a governance tool enabling auditability, traceability and regulatory
                       compliance.

                       Within our DIAMETER Horizon Europe project, involving 16 partners from
                       multiple European countries and Australia, OC contributed to extending ILIAS
                       as a common knowledge and communication platform for a complex industrial
                       and research consortium.

                       This included the development of SEO-oriented functionalities to improve
                       discoverability of project outputs through search engines and AI-based tools,
                       reducing fragmentation and dependence on external proprietary platforms,
                       such as the US-based social networks.

                       Beyond EU-funded projects, ILIAS deployments supported by OC currently
                       serve:

                           OC GROUP KNOWLEDGE IS VALUE
Prot.Doc.: lt***2501                                                                  Pag. 3

                       â¢ approximately 120,000 users in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano-South
                       Tyrol (official citizens platform of the german-speaking minority in Italy),

                       â¢ more than 43,000 users within the Belgian Ministry of Defence under a
                       multi-year public contract.

                       Across these contexts, advantages of open source results include:

                       â¢ measurable reduction in the number of external proprietary tools,

                       â¢ improved governance and continuity of institutional knowledge beyond
                       project lifecycles, with reduction of supplier lock in

                       â¢ increased security, auditability and compliance,

                       â¢ enhanced interoperability with existing information systems through open
                       standards.

                       These use cases demonstrate that open source platforms, when properly
                       governed within a strong community ecosystem, support knowledge
                       continuity,   a   critical   yet   often   overlooked    requirement    for    public
                       administrations, research and defence organisations.

                       3. Key barriers to the adoption and sustainability of open source software

                       Despite its strategic relevance, several structural barriers continue to limit the
                       impact of European open source software:

                       1.         Persistent misconception that open source equals âfreeâ

                       Procurement and funding models often underestimate the long-term
                       investment required for maintenance, security, governance and professional
                       support.

                       2.         Procurement frameworks focused on short-term products rather
                       than long-term infrastructures

                       Open source platforms function as evolving infrastructures, but are frequently
                       evaluated using criteria designed for closed, vendor-centric solutions.

                       3.         Economic and regulatory asymmetry with large non-EU vendors

                       European open source SMEs and communities contribute to local
                       ecosystems, upstream development and skills formation, while competing
                       against global platforms benefiting from scale effects and market dominance
                       (in the e-learning field the most famous is Moodle).

                       4.         Insufficient recognition of knowledge sovereignty

                            OC GROUP KNOWLEDGE IS VALUE
Prot.Doc.: lt***2501                                                                  Pag. 4

                       While data and cloud sovereignty are increasingly addressed, the strategic
                       importance of controlling, preserving and reusing institutional knowledge
                       (contents) through open platforms remains underrepresented.

                       5.        Fragmentation and loss of knowledge after project completion

                       Many EU-funded projects generate valuable knowledge that is not
                       systematically preserved or reused, due to the lack of shared, sustainable
                       knowledge infrastructures.

                       4. What the European Union should do

                       To strengthen the European open source ecosystem and its contribution to
                       digital sovereignty, we recommend:

                       1.        Establish structural funding mechanisms

                       Support not only research and innovation, but also long-term maintenance,
                       security and evolution of strategic open source infrastructures. Work to
                       improve access to credit from investors, still very different scenario from US
                       (for example, an Italian open source LMS such Docebo, migrated to USA in
                       2013 as SAAS service, got a significan amount of investments and is today
                       publicly listed in Toronto stock market and NASDAQ â we miss similar stories
                       in Europe)

                       2.        Adopt open sourceâaware public procurement policies

                       Introduce criteria that recognise lifecycle costs, governance models,
                       interoperability and upstream contributions, ensuring fair competition.

                       3.        Promote guided adoption of open source in public administrations

                       Define binding guidelines favouring open source solutions where functionally
                       equivalent, including reuse of existing European platforms.

                       4.        Invest in skills, training and professionalisation

                       Support education and capacity-building programmes covering technical,
                       organisational and governance aspects of open source software.

                       5.        Strengthen institutional communication and visibility

                       Actively promote European open source success stories, highlighting mature
                       platforms and the SMEs and communities that sustain them.

                       ________________________________________

                       5. Why this matters for European digital sovereignty

                       European open source LMS-LCMS software is not only a technological
                       choice, but a cornerstone of digital sovereignty, institutional resilience and
                       democratic governance.

                       By treating platforms such as ILIAS as shared European knowledge
                       infrastructures,   sustained   by   active   communities    and      professional
                       ecosystems, public institutions, research and industry can retain control over
                       their knowledge, ensure interoperability, reduce dependency on external
                       vendors and build sustainable digital ecosystems aligned with European
                       values and long-term policy objectives.
