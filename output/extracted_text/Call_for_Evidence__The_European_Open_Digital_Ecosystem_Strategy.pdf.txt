The European Union & Open Source
An Ecosystem Strategy for Tech Sovereignty, Security and
Democracy

OpenForum Europe welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the European
Commissionâs Call for Evidence on the forthcoming Communication Towards
European open digital ecosystems. We welcome the growing recognition
across EU institutions of the strategic importance of open source as a
foundational component of Europeâs digital infrastructure, as well as the
emerging convergence of policy initiatives that place software ecosystems at
the centre of Europeâs digital and industrial strategy.

The Communication is timely and well aligned with recent and forthcoming
policy instruments, including in cloud, data and AI, and signals a more
coherent approach to addressing Europeâs structural dependencies in critical
technology domains. The Commissionâs acknowledgement that Europe
combines strong developer communities with persistent barriers to scaling,
sustainability and market integration reflects a shared understanding of the
challenge.

This submission seeks to build on this positive momentum by offering a
structured analysis of open source as an under-leveraged policy tool and by
setting out policy recommendations aimed at strengthening competitiveness,
resilience, and long-term European capability.

                                                                              1/16
1. Strategic and political goals

1.1 The European Unionâs strategic objectives

As we understand them, the European Commissionâs overarching objectives for this
initiative are to:

    ââ   strengthen EU technological sovereignty and reduce dependencies;
    ââ   increase EU competitiveness in the digital economy;
    ââ   improve cybersecurity, resilience, and supply chain transparency; and
    ââ   ensure that critical digital capabilities are grounded in trusted, verifiable, and
         interoperable foundations.

These objectives are widely shared across EU institutions, Member States, and market
participants. The central policy question is therefore not one of intent, but, largely, of
execution: how these goals can be achieved effectively in software-driven sectors that
underpin the digital economy.

A key starting point is recognising that there is no inherent trade-off between
competitiveness, cost efficiency, and technological sovereignty. These objectives can be
mutually reinforcing if software policy focuses on open source through the lens of
ecosystem structure, innovation capacity, and market contestability rather than on
short-term substitution or infrastructure expansion alone.

1.2 Open source as a foundational innovation model for software

Open source should not be treated as a vertical policy domain or a niche technological
choice. It is the dominant innovation and production model for software, deeply
embedded across all layers of the digital stack and across sectors1.

Open source determines how software is developed, maintained, secured, and
integrated into real-world systems. It shapes how innovation diffuses, how
interoperability emerges, and mitigates how dependencies form within software supply
chains and the digital age. In practice, it often performs both a commoditising function
(i.e. technology available to any sector or use case) as well as a standardising function (i.e.
de facto industry standards, such as Linux kernel, or fora/consortia specifications which
complement formal standardisation processes and needs).

From an industrial policy perspective, this matters because the ability to influence
software ecosystems has a mutually reinforcing relationship with the ability to innovate,
to integrate digital technologies into industrial processes, and to capture value locally.
Investment strategies that prioritise software capability and ecosystem leadership, rather

                                                                                                      2/16
than infrastructure capacity alone, are therefore central to competitiveness and
sovereignty in software-intensive sectors.

Treating open source as an auxiliary consideration risks overlooking its systemic role in
shaping markets, competition, and resilience.

1.3 The current state of open source policy in the EU

Open source policy in the European Union has reached a decisive stage of maturity. The
European Commission has taken important steps to recognise the relevance of open
source, including through its Commission-internal open source software strategy, the
establishment of an Open Source Programme Office, analytical work on economic
impact, and legislative efforts to promote interoperability (e.g. Interoperable Europe Act,
Data Act, Digital Markets Act Regulation 1025/2012) as well as a better understanding of
cyber-resilience differentiators (e.g. CRA, DORA, NIS2). Open source has also gained
greater visibility within research and innovation programmes.

These efforts position the Commission among the most advanced public administrations
globally in its engagement with open source, and represent a solid foundation on which
further policy coherence can be built.

At the same time, ambition remains unevenly translated into policy structure. There is a
persistent mismatch between the central role open source plays in the economy and the
fragmented way it is addressed in policy. Open source underpins a substantial share of
digital infrastructure and software supply chains, yet it does not benefit from a coherent,
economy-wide strategic framework.

A useful comparison can be drawn with standardisation policy. The EU has developed a
comprehensive and coordinated approach to standardisation, supported by dedicated
governance, long-term investment, and strategic oversight. By contrast, open source
policy remains largely confined to internal usage and project-based interventions,
despite its comparable importance for interoperability, innovation, and sovereignty.

Addressing this gap requires treating open source as digital infrastructure, not merely as
a procurement option or research and development methodology.

1.4 International comparison and strategic positioning

Internationally, China is currently the only major economy to articulate an explicit,
integrated strategy for open source as part of its industrial and innovation policy. In this
approach, open source is linked to standards, skills, intellectual property management,
ecosystem leadership, and foundational technologies such as artificial intelligence. The
emergence of DeepSeek and other influential open source AI models in China is
important to consider in this context.

                                                                                         3/16
The relevance for the European Union is not to replicate this model, but to recognise
what it highlights. Jurisdictions that treat open source as a strategic asset are better
positioned to shape ecosystems, influence technical direction, and anchor value creation
domestically.

Without a similarly explicit strategic framing, Europe risks remaining a net contributor to
global open source ecosystems while value capture, platform control, and ecosystem
leadership accrue elsewhereâparticularly in cloud and AI.

Meeting the Commissionâs stated objectives therefore requires positioning open source
as a core instrument of software, industrial, and competition policy, and setting a clear
strategic direction for its role in Europeâs digital future.

2. Gaps in the current problem analysis

2.1 The role of users and procurers of IT as ecosystem actors

The current analysis underestimates the role of users and procurers of IT systems as
active participants and contributors in open source ecosystems. Large public and private
users, particularly in critical sectors, shape demand, contribute to projects and
foundations, and sustain the European open source industry through procurement and
service markets. Any ecosystem assessment that does not explicitly account for users
risks overlooking the primary drivers of adoption, sustainability, and market formation.

2.2 Distinguishing between projects and products

The analysis would benefit from a clearer distinction between open source projects and
communities, where software is developed and governed; and products and services,
where software is integrated, deployed, and commercialised. These layers face different
risks, incentives, and policy challenges. Conflating them risks ineffective interventions,
particularly with regard to sustainability, governance, and market integration. By way of
example, we see the current policy making lens struggling with concepts such as
âmonetisationâ or âmade availableâ to the open source models like upstream first where
companies invest their engineering thought leadership in upstream communities to build
functionality and/or fix security bugs whilst not necessarily pulling these developments
into a downstream product.

2.3 Strengthening data and measurement capacity

There is already substantial evidence of the central role open source plays in Europeâs
digital infrastructure and economy, and this provides a sufficient basis for the
Commission to advance concrete policy measures. At the same time, current data
remains uneven, fragmented, and often project-specific, which limits the ability to

                                                                                       4/16
monitor systemic risk, evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and adapt policy over
time.

Targeted investment in data collection, metrics, and analysis of how this changes over
time (longitudinal studies) should therefore be pursued in parallel with policy action.
Establishing these capabilities at an early stage would enable more granular insight into
software ecosystems and value chains, and would significantly strengthen Europeâs
capacity to design, implement, and refine open source policy over time.

The Commission should take the following actions:

   ââ Fund dedicated analysis of developer activity and attention in open source
      ecosystems, to understand where European developers contribute, how
      leadership and maintenance capacity is distributed, how ecosystems evolve over
      time, and where strategic capability is concentrated or lacking. This is essential for
      assessing Europeâs real position within global open source ecosystems and for
      identifying opportunities to strengthen European influence and sustainability.
   ââ Establish recurring economic impact studies on open source, building on the
      Commission's existing empirical work, with annual or biennial updates to create a
      longitudinal data series that allows the effects of policy choices to be traced over
      time.
   ââ Integrate relevant open source activity indicators into the digital infrastructure
      dimension of the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) dashboard for the
      Digital Decade ensuring that the contribution of open source to innovation,
      competitiveness, and resilience is visible at Member State level and can inform
      policy coordination and procurement of solutions which directly contribute to
      what is, largely, a public good.
   ââ Commission regular strategic market analyses focused on reducing
      dependency on individual software vendors and platforms. These analyses
      should map software usage across the full stack, assess market concentration
      and lock-in, identify critical dependency clusters, and evaluate the availability and
      maturity of open source alternatives. Such studies provide an essential evidence
      base with clear and data-supported identification of a specific business/market
      challenge for prioritisation and policy targeting.
   ââ Develop dedicated analysis of software dependencies as systemic
      infrastructure risk, distinct from product-level market analysis. This should focus
      on identifying widely reused open source components embedded across
      multiple products and sectors, assessing maintenance and security capacity, and
      informing upstream investment and stewardship decisions, including through
      mechanisms such as the EU Sovereign Tech Fund.

Without sustained investment in data and measurement, even well-designed open
source policies risk being guided by assumptions rather than evidence.

                                                                                       5/16
3. Sector and ecosystem goals

As we understand them, the European Commissionâs ecosystem objectives are to:

   1.â develop a stronger and more competitive EU open source sector, encompassing
       companies, foundations, and developer communities;
   2.â support start-ups, SMEs, and innovators as key drivers of open sourceâbased
       innovation and industrial renewal;
   3.â ensure that open source solutions can scale effectively from research and
       experimentation to industrial deployment and market integration; and
   4.â improve the governance, maintenance, sustainability, and security of open source
       projects, particularly those that are critical to European digital infrastructure.

These objectives reflect a shift from viewing open source primarily as a development
input towards recognising it as an ecosystem that requires deliberate policy support.
Achieving them depends on aligning funding, governance, skills, and demand-side
instruments so that open source communities and European businesses can translate
technical innovation into commercial success in Europe and export markets around the
world.

3.2 Policy recommendations (ecosystem focus)

To achieve the Commissionâs ecosystem objectives, policy action should focus on
shaping the structural conditions under which open source ecosystems can emerge,
scale, and remain sustainable.

Ecosystem structure and leadership

   ââ Support European actors in assuming leadership roles within strategically
      important open source ecosystems, including project governance,
      roadmap-setting, coordination, and technical leadership upstream as project
      maintainers.
   ââ Encourage ecosystem âchampionsâ not as national winners, but as anchors of the
      EU's shared infrastructure, ensuring that leadership remains open, transparent,
      and globally engaged, and that these actors act as responsible open source
      citizens through sustained upstream contribution and proactive investment in the
      security and long-term sustainability of projects, beyond minimum regulatory
      requirements.
   ââ Align open source ecosystem policy with competition and standardisation policy,
      recognising their complementary roles in shaping interoperable and contestable
      markets.

                                                                                    6/16
Sustainability and maintenance of critical components

   ââ Treat maintenance, security, and long-term stewardship of critical open source
      components as digital infrastructure, not discretionary overhead.
   ââ Establish dedicated mechanisms to fund maintenance, security improvements,
      and governance of widely used components, including through instruments such
      as the EU Sovereign Tech Fund.
   ââ Use dependency mapping to prioritise support for components whose failure or
      neglect would create systemic risk across sectors.

Skills and workforce development

   ââ Integrate open source development, maintenance, and governance practices into
      education, training, and reskilling programmes at EU and national level.
   ââ Support specialised training and certification linked to real-world open source
      ecosystems, not abstract curricula.
   ââ Strengthen organisational skills by linking workforce development explicitly to
      OSPO creation and operation.

Governance, foundations, and OSPO networks

   ââ Support the professionalisation and sustainability of open source foundations that
      provide neutral governance and prevent ecosystem capture.
   ââ Expand and interconnect OSPO networks across the public and private sectors,
      treating OSPOs as the institutional interface between policy, procurement, and
      open source communities.
   ââ Encourage consistent OSPO mandates covering contribution policies,
      dependency management, security practices, and community engagement.
   ââ Identify areas of strategic importance where governmental or privately owned
      OSPOs could focus their expertise - such as strengthening Europeâs use and
      development of open-weighted AI models and/or use of small language models.

Demand-side instruments to support ecosystem growth

   ââ Use public and large-scale private demand as a market-shaping instrument, not
      merely a cost-saving tool.
   ââ Align procurement, reference architectures, and funding programmes to favour
      modular, interoperable solutions built on open source and open standards.
   ââ Ensure that demand-side measures incentivise upstream contribution and
      ecosystem participation, not just downstream consumption.

Leveraging EU funding programmes as ecosystem instruments

   ââ Use Horizon Europe and other EU funding programmes to strengthen open
      source ecosystems through programme design, not additional spending.

                                                                                   7/16
   ââ Integrate clear open source requirements into calls and evaluation criteria,
      including by extending Open Science obligations to cover source code.
   ââ Reward ecosystem contribution and leadership, such as governance participation
      and long-term stewardship, within proposal scoring.

4. Adoption, market, and operational goals

As we understand them, the European Commissionâs adoption and market objectives are
to:

   ââ increase the adoption of high-quality and secure open source solutions by both
      public administrations and private users;
   ââ address persistent barriers related to procurement practices, usability, integration
      with legacy systems, and policy alignment;
   ââ promote viable business and sustainability models for open source, including
      through publicâprivate partnerships;
   ââ improve coordination of EU support actions across funding instruments, policy
      initiatives, and implementation mechanisms;
   ââ provide Member States with a clearer and more consistent framework to support
      national open source ecosystems; and
   ââ build an EU-centred foundation and infrastructure layer capable of sustaining
      open digital ecosystems over the long term.

4.2 Policy recommendations (adoption and market focus)
Procurement and demand aggregation

   ââ Reform procurement practices to incentivise upstream models which contribute
      significantly to the viability and sustainability to upstream communities;
   ââ Use of high-hygiene, IP unencumbered, open standards and specifications which
      enable modular adoption, incremental replacement, and genuine switching
      between suppliers. The upcoming review of the European Interoperability
      Framework is an opportunity to address this within the Interoperable Europe Act's
      framework.
   ââ Aggregate demand across administrations and sectors where appropriate,
      creating predictable markets for high-quality open source solutions.
   ââ Move beyond pilots by supporting production-ready deployments and long-term
      service contracts.

Market integration and interoperability

   ââ Promote interoperability through alignment with open standards and shared
      reference architectures, reducing integration costs with legacy systems.
   ââ Ensure that regulatory and policy frameworks do not unintentionally
      disadvantage open sourceâbased solutions compared to vertically integrated
      proprietary offerings.

                                                                                     8/16
   ââ Support testing, certification, and assurance schemes that recognise open source
      development models.

Business models and value capture

   ââ Support viable business models around open source, including services,
      integration, support, and managed offerings.
   ââ Encourage publicâprivate partnerships that combine public demand with private
      sector delivery while preserving openness and competition.
   ââ Ensure that EU funding and policy frameworks enable European companies to
      capture value from open source without undermining community sustainability.

Coordination between EU and Member State actions

   ââ Provide Member States with a clear strategic framework for national open source
      policies aligned with EU goals and supported by the Interoperable Europe Act.
   ââ Use the revised European Interoperability Framework and the EU definition of
      open standards as a common reference for cross-border interoperability, and
      recognise these standards as implementable through open source by default.
   ââ Encourage exchange of best practices between Member States, particularly on
      procurement, OSPOs, and ecosystem support.

Institutional and infrastructural support for adoption at scale

   ââ Strengthen EU-level institutional capacity to support adoption, including through
      coordination structures, guidance, and technical assistance.
   ââ Invest in shared open source infrastructure and support services that lower
      adoption barriers, such as repositories, collaboration platforms, and security
      tooling.
   ââ Ensure that adoption policies reinforce long-term sustainability, security, and
      control rather than short-term deployment metrics.

                                                                                   9/16
Annex: Responses to the Call for Evidence
questions
1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are
the main barriers that hamper

      (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source;

      and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

Strengths of the EU open source sector

    ââ A strong base of developers, projects, and technical communities active across
       critical technology domains.
    ââ Increasing institutional awareness of open source within public administrations
       and EU policy frameworks.
    ââ Alignment of open source practices with EU values on transparency,
       interoperability, and security.

Key weaknesses

The EUâs primary structural weakness lies in the user segment of the open source
ecosystem. In mature open source ecosystems, software-intensive
organisationsâpublic administrations and private enterprisesâare not only adopters
but active users/contributors: they contribute upstream, fund maintenance, and
participate in governance. In Europe, many organisationsâprivate and publicâremain
passive consumers.

This weakness manifests as:

    ââ Insufficient internal capacity within user organisations to engage strategically
       with open source.
    ââ Limited deployment of OSPOs in both the public and private sectors.
    ââ Skills gaps that prevent users from contributing sustainably to projects they
       depend on.

Main barriers to (i) adoption and maintenance

    ââ Lack of organisational capacity among users to contribute upstream and
       thereby manage dependencies, security, and maintenance.
    ââ Outdated procurement practices that are constructed for off-the-shelf
       proprietary alternatives, and under-estimate open source products and
       companies, and how they provide an accelerated digital transformation without
       lock-in or lock-out risks. The upcoming review of the EUâs 2014 procurement

                                                                                     10/16
       regulations are such an opportunity to update accordingly.
    ââ Underinvestment in maintenance and long-term stewardship of critical
       components.

 Main barriers to (ii) sustainable contributions
    ââ   Absence of OSPOs as coordinating structures within user organisations.
    ââ   Skills shortages that prevent systematic upstream engagement.
    ââ   Misalignment between organisational incentives and community sustainability
    ââ   Lack of clarity in the context of product liability

 In short, Europeâs challenge is not a lack of open source supply, but insufficiently
 mature demand-side actors capable of sustaining ecosystems.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security,
innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added value.

 The added value of open source for public and private sectors is often discussed in
 terms of cost efficiency, reduced lock-in, improved security through transparency, and
 increased innovation. While these factors are relevant, they are well understood and
 largely undisputed. More importantly for policy design, there is now robust empirical
 evidence that demand-side open source policy produces measurable economic and
 competitiveness effects.

 Research analysing a French government procurement policy that explicitly favoured
 open source provides a clear example of this mechanism. The policy created an
 unexpected demand shock for open source software. The results demonstrate that
 such demand-side intervention led to:

    ââ a substantial increase in open source contributions by developers based in
       France, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of additional contributions per
       year;
    ââ significant spillover effects within the domestic economy, including increased
       firm-level adoption of open source, higher rates of IT start-up formation, and
       substantial growth in IT employment; and
    ââ productivity and competitiveness gains that accrued specifically within France,
       despite the globally shared nature of open source outputs.

 Crucially, these effects were not driven by subsidies or direct supply-side intervention,
 but by procurement acting as a low-cost industrial policy instrument. By reshaping
 market incentives, public demand encouraged firms and individuals to invest in open
 source capabilities, skills, and organisational practices. This translated into durable
 economic benefits rather than one-off cost savings.

 The evidence demonstrates that open source delivers value not only through lower
 costs or reduced lock-in, but by structuring markets in ways that favour competition,

                                                                                        11/16
entry, and domestic capability-building. For policymakers, this implies that the most
significant added value of open source arises when it is treated as a demand-led
ecosystem strategy rather than a purely technical or ideological choice.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

The EU open source sector is well-developed in terms of developers and industry.
Europe already hosts a wide range of high-quality open source companies,
foundations, and communities, and open source is firmly established as a viable and
competitive commercial model globally.

Moreover, empirical evidence shows that commercial open source companies
consistently match or outperform proprietary peers in fundraising, valuations, and exit
outcomes, particularly in infrastructure, data, and developer tooling.

The challenge for EU policy is therefore not to âcreateâ an open source industry, but to
ensure that existing strengths translate into sustained ecosystem leadership, market
scaling, and long-term value capture in Europe. Moreover, the term âsectorâ doesnât
lend itself well to open source which is by definition a commons where technologies
are developed and commoditised for use and further development in all sectors. It is
horizontal, and strategic policy should be horizontal, akin to SME or standardisation
policy.

A central finding from the evidence is that open source ecosystems respond strongly
to demand-side signals. Where demand is credible and sustained, firms invest in open
source capabilities, communities grow, and both commercial and community
outcomes improve. This is consistent with research showing that open source adoption
is a powerful go-to-market mechanism and that community health and commercial
success are tightly coupled

EU-level measures should therefore focus on:

    ââ Strengthening demand for open source solutions, particularly through public
       procurement, reference architectures, and alignment with open standards, in
       order to create predictable markets rather than one-off pilots.
    ââ Supporting the organisational capacity of users, so that increased demand
       results in sustainable ecosystem engagement rather than passive consumption.
       This includes targeted support for OSPOs in both the public and private sectors.
    ââ Facilitating scaling and market integration, rather than substituting for private
       investment. Evidence shows that open source companies do not require more
       capital or time to reach maturity; instead, they convert investment into value
       efficiently when market conditions are supportive.
    ââ Reinforcing links between community health and cybersecurity, recognising
       that well-resourced and diverse open source communities correlate with higher
       quality, faster iteration, and improved resilience.

                                                                                    12/16
In short, EU policy should aim to amplify what already works: using demand,
coordination, and capacity-building to ensure that Europeâs open source industry can
scale, remain secure, and anchor long-term strategic autonomy.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

Decisions on priority technology areas should be grounded in systematic analysis of
dependencies, risks, and market structure, not in abstract lists of technologies. A
central finding from existing national-level work is that effective prioritisation requires
first understanding where dependencies actually exist, how they accumulate across the
software stack, and which components are critical for operations, security, and
innovation.

A concrete example of this approach is the strategic market analysis conducted for the
German federal administration, which assessed dependency risks by mapping
software usage across the full software stack, analysing market concentration, and
identifying critical âpain pointsâ linked to sovereignty, security, cost control, and
innovation capacity. This analysis did not begin by selecting preferred technologies,
but by building an evidence base on:

    ââ   concentration and lock-in across different layers of the stack;
    ââ   interdependencies between components and vendors;
    ââ   the availability and maturity of open source alternatives; and
    ââ   the organisational and skills implications of different strategic options.

A comparable, EU-level approach is needed. The Commission should therefore invest
first in structured data collection and dependency mapping across key technology
domains, including cloud, AI, cybersecurity, internet technologies, and industrial
systems. This should cover:

    ââ Assess and understand the current paradox of the pervasiveness of open
       source technologies and enterprise grade solutions whilst the percentage of
       market share is still dominated by proprietary companies;

    ââ which open source components are actually used in products and services;
    ââ how dependencies concentrate around specific projects, maintainers, or
       vendors;
    ââ where open source already provides viable alternatives; and
    ââ where ecosystem weaknesses pose systemic risks.

On this basis can priority technology areas be identified credibly and updated over
time.

Such an approach also avoids a common pitfall: attempting to âbuildâ alternatives
without first understanding existing ecosystems and leverage points. Open source
already underpins most digital infrastructure. The strategic task is therefore to identify
choke points, reinforce critical components, and enable substitution and modularity

                                                                                       13/16
where dependencies are excessive.

In short, prioritisation should be to strengthen use and upstream activity in terms of
software code functionality in areas where breaking strategic dependency is the most
urgent. EU investment in open source data collection is not ancillary to this process; it
is the enabling condition for making informed, proportionate, and effective strategic
choices.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
competitiveness and cyber resilience?

The sectors covered by the NIS2 Directive provide a clear lens through which verticals
to prioritise the increased use of and contribution to open source for competitiveness
and cyber resilience. NIS2 distinguishes Essential Entities â such as energy, transport,
banking and financial infrastructure, healthcare, digital infrastructure, public
administration, space, and water/wastewater â from Important Entities â including
postal and courier services, waste management, chemicals, food, manufacturing,
digital providers (e.g. online marketplaces and search engines), and research.

Across both categories, organisations face common challenges: dependency on a
narrow set of proprietary products and platforms, limited visibility into software supply
chains, rising and unpredictable costs, and systemic lock-in that constrains operational
flexibility and resilience.

Open source can address these challenges in two complementary ways.

Competitiveness: By enabling modular, interoperable solutions, open source lowers
barriers to entry and supports a more diverse supplier base, including European SMEs
and service providers. This reduces vendor concentration and strengthens competition
in sectors such as manufacturing, digital infrastructure, and public services.

Cyber resilience: Transparency, auditability, and shared maintenance practices
inherent to open source improve vulnerability detection and remediation, particularly
when ecosystems are adequately resourced and governed.

Importantly, prioritising sectors and interventions requires understanding
dependencies at two distinct levels. From a user perspective, dependency is
experienced through products and services procured and operated by NIS2 entities.
From a systemic perspective, risk accumulates through software dependencies: widely
reused open source components embedded across many products and sectors, often
maintained by limited upstream capacity.

This is why robust data collection and dependency mapping are essential. Without
visibility into which open source components underpin critical products and services,
policy risks addressing symptoms rather than structural risk. Investment in data
collection would allow policymakers to identify concentration points, assess systemic

                                                                                     14/16
exposure across NIS2 sectors, and target interventions proportionately.

In this context, the EU Sovereign Tech Fund (EU-STF), modelled on the excellent work
by the German Sovereign Tech Agency, is a key policy lever. The newly established
Digital Commons EDIC highlighted in the call for evidence is a promising vehicle to
scale the Sovereign Tech Fund to the EU level. Its purpose is not to promote adoption
per se, but to enable coordinated identification of critical open source dependencies
and to support upstream investment in their security, maintenance, and sustainability.
By strengthening the open source components most relied upon across NIS2 sectors,
EU-STF-style mechanisms can reduce shared risk for all downstream users. This is
probably the cybersecurity lever with the single best cost to benefit ratio that is on the
table for the EU.

 OFE is a not-for-profit, independent European based think tank which focuses on openness within the IT
 sector. OFE draws its support from a broad range of stakeholders committed to openness: Among them
   leading global ICT technology providers, European SMEs, user organisations, the openness academic
  community represented by the OpenForum Academy and the wider openness community. Tapping into
this broad basis for support provides OFE with expertise across all major ICT topics, including applying its
  knowledge to the evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing and
            IoT. Views expressed by OFE do not necessarily reflect those held by its supporters.
