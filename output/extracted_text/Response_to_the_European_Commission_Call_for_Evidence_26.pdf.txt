Summary
OpenUK welcomes the EUâs consultation and the opportunity to make this contribution to
the Commissionâs proposed strategic approach to the EUâs Open Digital Ecosystem. We
strongly support measures that: (1) fund and maintain foundational open source
infrastructure; (2) reduce fragmentation and unlock interoperability; (3) strengthen security
and resilience across sectors; and (4) enable global collaboration (including structured
participation by nonâEU partners such as the UK) to accelerate innovation.

The objectives are worthy, heading in the right direction, but key to these being successful is
how the implementation of any strategy is achieved. We recognise decades of engagement
across Europe have failed to see appropriate measures implemented to ensure a healthy
ecosystem in which any European nation benefits, appropriately participates in and
contributes back to the open source ecosystem, despite steps in the right direction.

Others in the EU are submitting detailed lists of these responses and we believe it would be
inappropriate for OpenUK to suggest these, but OpenUK supports these and is currently
working in the UK with our national funding body on similar and aligned recommendations.

EU projects benefit from extensive contributions from the global open source community/
Over 90% of todayâs software infrastructure having open source dependencies and over 70%
of that being open source.

This open source software underlying all stacks in 2026 is dependent on open source from
global contributors including from the UK. The UK continues to be Europeâs leading
contributor to open source software and 5th globally with significant collaboration with EU
partners including in particular Germany and France who are the UKâs second and third
strongest collaboration partners.

The EUâs approach to open source software is therefore not only relevant to EU countries
and open source in those countries, but is of great significance to the UK and other global
countries which engage in open source collaboration.

For the EUâs approach to succeed to its potential requires a clear pathway to ongoing
collaboration and an understanding that code created on an open-source-basis will benefit
all nations in the same way as code from all nations underpins todayâs infrastructure and is
available to the EU under open source licensing. Licensing is subject to local laws and this
availability is subject only to a few specified exceptions due to export control and sanctions
along with any local laws.

OpenUK encourages an EU policy that welcomes and organises its international collaborative
efforts. We hope to enhance strong and engaged collaboration with the EU open source
technical, governance, and policy communities.

Sovereignty is a key discussion globally and in particular for the EU. The role of open source
in software, hardware, data AI and the future of innovation and the access to the technology
open source enables is a cornerstone to creating sovereignty by enabling the removal of
dependency on entities from any country. However it must be recognised that whilst this
may be achieved through open source this is global open source and not âlocal sourceâ
initiatives.

Utilisation of existing code, innovation and AI allows the EU to stand on the shoulders of
giants and strengthens the basis of EU digital sovereignty across its digital environments, this
must recognise the global interactions at the heart of open source and also requires outputs
to be globally available. Open source will enable the EU to grow shared capabilities,
participate in the best innovation and reduce single points of failure, if this collaborative
approach and a holistic view to funding, contribution and management is applied. â
â
Policy options that ring-fence collaboration by geography or take a âgo it aloneâ approach to
digital, risk undercutting collaboration and will inevitably impact significantly Europeâs
competitiveness in the global economy; and ability to engage in and benefit from open
source. We encourage both global collaboration as a starting point and a limited use of
sanctions and other restrictions on global collaboration.

Specific Questions

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open source sector? What are the
main barriers that hamper: (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open
source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open source communities?

The EU benefits from a strong open source ecosystem, with Germany and France in
particular showing strength in numbers of developers and projects hosted. Germany is
currently seen to be 7th globally and whilst France has Europeâs fastest growing open source
community1.

The EUâs significant and active talent base reflects both scale and depth of capability, making
enormous contributions to global open source development. This demonstrates a vibrant,
productive ecosystem and confirms open source as a major pillar of European
competitiveness and digital capacity.The success of EU open source is inseparable from
wider international collaboration. Open source development is inherently transnational and
EU projects routinely rely on contributions from elsewhere.

According to figures from GitHub2, in 2025 â EU based open source projects received more
than 553,000 code contributions from developers in the United Kingdom, highlighting the
continued material role of UK expertise in the growth and health of European open source.

Any policy that creates barriers to such cross-border collaboration on open source would
limit the diversity, sustainability and pace of innovation in the EU ecosystem. Open source
communities thrive on global contribution flows, and the EUâs strategy should aim to
preserve and strengthen these links, including with close partners such as the UK.

Our research illustrates the scale of the UKâs contribution. Using conservative estimates
based on GitHub developer account data, the UK had around 109,460 accounts in 2018,
increasing to approximately 126,000 in 2019 following typical growth rates. Today the UK
has 4.8m GitHub accounts.

When applying the European Commissionâs 2021 methodology for calculating economic impact,
the UKâs developer base represents an estimated Â£29.52 billion to Â£43.15 billion in economic
value. This underscores not only the UKâs strong skills base in areas such as cloud engineering,
security, and open source compliance. Despite our obvious existing collaboration there is
significant value in greater coordinated EU-UK collaboration which could deliver significant
benefits to both EU and UK ecosystems.

Notwithstanding its strengths, the EU open source sector faces several challenges and
barriers today Fragmentation across Member States continues to limit the effectiveness of
large scale initiatives, leading to duplication of effort and inconsistent outcomes.
Interoperability challenges remain a major obstacle.

Limited access to essential technical standards, coupled with high costs of standards,
challenges in the use of Standard Essential Patents and licensing restrictions, create
difficulties for open communities seeking to implement, verify or comply with standards.

In addition, skills shortages persist in areas that are critical to secure and sustainable open
source development coupled with talent flight. Areas such as cloud orchestration,
cybersecurity and governance whilst weak in the EU are comparatively strong in the UK and
collaboration would be particularly beneficial for the EU.

Sustainable contributions to open source from the EU are also hindered by the absence of
long-term funding mechanisms. Many foundational components that underpin European
industry rely heavily on global volunteer labour or underfunded maintainers. Existing EU
funding programmes tend to prioritise research and the development of new features,
rather than providing the consistent and long-term maintenance, security hardening and
infrastructure support that these critical components require. A significant shift will be
required forfeiting up to 20% of that funding for maintenance if success is to be attained.

The EU, like the UK, has suffered from talent flight and a long history of open source success
stories in business leaving Europe to flourish in the US, exemplified in critical projects like
Franceâs Docker.

In summary, the EUâs open source sector has significant strengths, including scale, talent and
productivity. However, fragmentation, interoperability barriers, skills shortages and funding
sustainability all remain key challenges. Given the global nature of open source
development, any restriction on cross border collaboration would exacerbate these
weaknesses. A successful future EU strategy will therefore require a strong emphasis on
international cooperation, including close partnership with the UK, alongside targeted action
to address internal structural challenges and ensure the long-term health of the ecosystem.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security,
innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added value.

Â© OpenUK 2026, OpenUK is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee registered in England at
8 Coldbath Square London EC1R 5HL, Company Number 11209475
                                                                                                  5
Open source creates significant economic, social and operational value across both the
public and private sectors. In both the public and private sector. The benefits of open source
include: (1) reduction in costs as no royalty licence fees; (2) remove costs through
collaborative innovation; (3) benefit from third party and community contributions; (4)
enable collaborative research and development; (5) improved deliverables; (6) accelerate
delivery time; (7) increased agility in development process; (8) ability to re-cycle and re-use
code; (9) improved understanding of good practices and governance; (10) engagement and
connection; (11) building skills; (12) enabling collaborative research and development; (13)
increased security; (14) trust through transparency; and (15) development of skills and
Know-How. These advantages compound when foundational components are maintained as
part of public digital infrastructure and digital goods and when standards and data are open
and accessible for broad reuse.

Organisations have the potential to avoid vendor lock-in as they can access, inspect and
adapt source code. In true open source models users may switch providers benefiting from
interoperability, or fork projects where necessary. The benefits of open source removing
lock-in can be reduced however by the service providerâs use of a closed service layer,
charges like egress fees and add-on proprietary code. As with many aspects of open source
the key is in the how - meaning how the code, strategy or policy is implemented.

For creators of open source it offers the opportunity of unprecedented adoption in its go to
market strategy and enables the creation of de facto standards like Linux and Kubernetes. Its
fundamental premise of access and sharing sits at the heart of the free flow of its licensing,
relying on the ability of anyone to use the code for any purpose. This in turn enables
iterative global development. These principles have been exemplified in AI with the
US-based Llama LLM being distilled alongside China-based Qwen to enable the creation of
DeepSeekâs R1 open model, improving AI innovation and reducing the cost of creating an
LLM from $100m to $5m.

It was evident in that report that 100% of all start ups founded in the preceding three years
used open source. It was also clear that more mature organisations planned to increase their
investment in open source. Through the open source maturity cycle greater value is attached
to skills development, collaboration, community participation and knowledge sharing as
leading benefits of open source, ahead of direct cost savings. Yet direct cost savings are
critical and cannot be ignored.

It is notable in our research that whilst cost saving is regularly the single most important
reason for organisational use of open source software, the single biggest complaint is also
cost. This recognises the dichotomy that although open source is royalty free it is not free,
and has significant costs to be well managed. These costs are not surfaced in the same
manner as in the traditional software environment and manifest in costs like conference
engagement, membership fees and travel budgets to enable ecosystem engagement and
build, as well as contribution to project and maintainer costs. For the EU to engage
appropriately and fully, significant budgets are required. The nuance and complexity is yet

                                                                                                  6
greater when it is understood that nation statesâ economic contributions to open source
cannot succeed in isolation and must be achieved in a joined-up manner

Open source not only enables iterative innovation but accelerates product development
cycles, and improves resilience. These factors explain why many businesses depend heavily
on open source as the basis of the public cloud, databases, software tooling and operating
systems. Today open source forms the basis of our national digital infrastructure.

Evidence from OpenUKâs 2023 State of Open Report underlines the economic significance of
these benefits to the UK by way of example. Open source contributed an estimated Â£13.59
billion in Gross Value Add (GVA) to the United Kingdom in 2022, representing approximately
27% of the UKâs tech sector economy. This focus on the value generated by open source as
opposed to cost of replacement was ground breaking and relevant to all seeking to
understand the importance of open source. Similar data would be found for leading EU
countries.

The success of open source and reaping its benefits is restricted by how it is implemented
and how ecosystems are supported at a national level.

Historically open source was used by public sectors in particular to: (1) remove vendor
lock-in and create interoperability; and (2) create publicly-funded code that was recycled and
re-used. In recent times weâ have seen a third strength, its ability to generate influence
through adoption added to this. In the public sector, open source aligns naturally with
principles of openness, transparency, and accountability. Governments benefit from the
ability to inspect and adapt software, which improves security assurance and reduces
procurement risks. Open source adoption also fosters internal capability development. Civil
servants can contribute to open source communities, learn new technical skills and engage
directly with global development practices. Open technologies further support public sector
mandates for transparent and auditable systems, which is particularly important in areas
such as digital identity, public registries, welfare systems and public data platforms.

At the same time, the value of open source will be amplified when foundational components
which are in effect public infrastructure are recognised and supported as digital public
goods. Reliable investment in maintenance, security and long-term stewardship ensures that
widely used libraries, packages and core tools remain secure and robust. The benefits of
open source are also greatest when technical standards and public sector datasets are
accessible on open terms, since this promotes interoperability, competition and innovation.

Across both public and private sectors, open source strengthens cyber resilience.
Community driven development enables early detection and remediation of vulnerabilities,
while forkability ensures that organisations can maintain operational continuity even if a
supplier fails or a vulnerability is discovered in a core dependency. Open source also
contributes to national and regional digital sovereignty by allowing governments and
businesses to build on verifiable, modifiable infrastructure rather than relying exclusively on
proprietary platforms controlled by vendors outside their jurisdiction.

Taken together, these factors demonstrate that open source delivers substantial added value
to both the public and private sectors. It reduces cost and lock in, improves security and
transparency, accelerates innovation and plays a central role in developing skills and digital
capability across the economy.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

The EUâs open source ecosystem is already a major driver of innovation, competitiveness
and digital resilience within the EU. However, its long-term strength depends on strategic
measures that address systemic weaknesses, including fragmentation, skills shortages,
uneven investment in essential components and limited access to standards and critical
infrastructure. To contribute meaningfully to the EUâs technological sovereignty and
cybersecurity agenda, the next phase of policy intervention must focus on strengthening the
foundations of open source, improving coordination across Member States and global
partners including the UK, and supporting sustainable, secure and internationally
collaborative development. This would require a shift in investment, skills development and
contribution to a joined up ecosystem.

Our colleagues in the EU have made specific recommendations which we support. These
should be implemented in a way that enhances global collaboration.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

Open source underpins all digital infrastructure today. The technology areas that should be
prioritised are those that consistently appear across industries as highâimpact enablers of
security, innovation, interoperability and longâterm sustainability. This spans hardware and
silicon as well as software and there is a need to strengthen production and supply chains in
these, through open specifications and open or de facto standards.

Securityâcritical technologies: Securityâfocused open source technologies should be a top
priority because they underpin the protection and integrity of digital infrastructure across all
sectors. Across industries, there is evidence that AI, ML, operation systems, platform
environments including cloud and tooling are consistently identified as the technologies
most benefiting from open source/ These areas align directly with a priority focus on
securityâcritical languages and components, including memoryâsafe ecosystems such as
Rust, cryptographic libraries, secure build systems, and supply chain and AI tooling. Given
the high levels of AI and ML use in safetyâcritical and regulated sectors, prioritising open,
transparent and verifiable AI tooling is essential for detecting vulnerabilities, ensuring

                                                                                                  8
auditability and maintaining public trust. This need is echoed in wider industry studies,
which show strong confidence in open source security and a recognised need for investment
in secure development and automation tooling.

Interoperability: Open digital ecosystems depend on technologies that enable systems to
communicate securely and efficiently. Across several industries, the key benefits of open
source include innovation, productivity, transparency and interoperability, particularly
pronounced in telecommunications and financial services, where industry standards are
vital. Open source supports identity management, secure data exchange, messaging
protocols, and open and vendorâneutral standards.

However, the EU still faces interoperability challenges due to a lack of universally adopted
open standards, leading to integration friction and higher costs. As such, the EU should
prioritise investments in open standards and open alternatives to dominant proprietary
platforms.

Public digital infrastructure: Across all sectors, a large proportion of open source
contributions are concentrated in areas such as : cloud and containerisation - up to 33% of
contributions; CI/CD automation - up to 30%; web and application development - up to 28%;
operating systems - between 19% and 37% - sector depending; and IoT and embedded
technologies - significant in industrial sectors (21%). These components form the spine of
today;s digital services and production systems. Yet, many remain underâmaintained
because they lack commercial monetisation pathways and rely on volunteer maintainers,
creating longâterm security and resilience risks.

The EU should prioritise funding to support and maintain public infrastructure through open
source software, open standards, open hardware including silicon, open data and AI
openness. It is critical that it engages in a collaborative manner with other countries seeking
to do the same.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
competitiveness and cyber resilience?

An increased use of open source has the potential to deliver significant gains in both
competitiveness and cyber resilience across a wide range of sectors. Open source enables
shared components, transparent security practices and community driven identification and
remediation of vulnerabilities, which together reduce vendor dependence and improve
organisational agility. These characteristics are particularly valuable in sectors that operate
critical infrastructure or that rely on complex, rapidly evolving digital systems.

The following sectors would benefit immediately from deeper adoption of open source and
collaboration around this:

                                                                                                  9
     ââ Automotive: Connected vehicle platforms - already rely on collaborative software
        stacks, and greater openness would drive interoperability, safety and cybersecurity;
        open charging where standards such as OCPP, could enhance interoperability across
        the EU and beyond;
     ââ Mobile: the sector has shifted to software defined infrastructure and increasingly
        adopting open source. Transparency and interoperability are essential for trust and
        network resilience. GSMA, ETSI and other organisations are beginning to understand
        the value of open source in particular in providing open source implementations for
        standards.
     ââ Healthcare: open technologies improve the transparency and auditability of clinical
        systems and medical devices, auditability, cybersecurity and trustworthy AI are vital
        for safe clinical decision making as is interoperability of patient data and systems
        utilised in that data management;
     ââ manufacturing and industry: secure embedded systems and IoT support resilient
        supply chains and automation; and
     ââ financial services: open source underpins secure, scalable transaction systems and
        reduces reliance on proprietary black box technology. Public administrations can use
        open source to improve accountability, reduce costs and avoid single supplier
        dependency, while also accelerating their adoption of secure digital services.

At the same time, several structural weaknesses within the EU open source landscape risk
limiting the effectiveness of open source adoption in these sectors. Fragmentation between
Member States continues to hinder coordination, resulting in duplicated initiatives and slow
progress. Interoperability barriers remain a persistent challenge, including a lack of
universally adopted open standards developed within Europe. This increases the cost and
complexity of integrating open and proprietary systems and reduces the competitiveness of
organisations seeking to modernise their technology stacks.

Skills shortages create another constraint. There is a lack of professionals with lack of
expertise in European open source technologies, cloud orchestration and cybersecurity. This
shortage limits the ability of organisations to adopt, deploy and maintain secure open source
systems. It also slows the rate of digital transformation across sectors that would benefit
most from open source approaches. However, the UK has a particularly strong skills base in
these areas. Closer EU-UK collaboration would therefore help to address existing shortages
within the EU and strengthen overall ecosystem resilience.

Funding sustainability through ecosystem and maintenance, also remains a key barrier to
the long-term viability of open source in high impact sectors. Many critical components are
maintained by volunteers or small teams with limited resources. The current funding

8 Coldbath Square London EC1R 5HL, Company Number 11209475
                                                                                                  10
landscape tends to favour large, established projects and prioritises the development of new
features over essential maintenance, security hardening and ongoing support. Without
appropriate funding mechanisms, organisations in sectors such as transport, energy, health
or financial services may find themselves relying on under-resourced components, which
could create cybersecurity and operational risks. Any proposed funding mechanism should
be internationally collaborative.

Use of open source and greater collaboration can remove dependency in these and other
sectors and allow for diversification and supply chain resilience.

Across all these sectors, the same principles apply. Open source improves cyber resilience by
enabling rapid patching, community oversight and forkability in the event of a supply chain
compromise. It increases competitiveness by reducing vendor lock in, encouraging
innovation and facilitating interoperability. To maximise these benefits, however, barriers
relating to fragmentation, standards access, skills, and long-term funding must be
addressed. Given the UKâs strong skills base and substantial contribution to European open
source, ensuring that international collaboration remains central to the EUâs approach will
further strengthen competitiveness and resilience across these sectors.
