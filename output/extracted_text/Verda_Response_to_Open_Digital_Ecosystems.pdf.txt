Response to the â
Call for Evidence: â
Towards European â
Open Digital
Ecosystems
Introduction: â
Bridging the Compute and Software Gap
Verda (formerly DataCrunch), a Helsinki-based AI infrastructure provider, welcomes the Commissionâs initiative on European open
digital ecosystems and the role of open source software (OSS) in strengthening Europeâs technological sovereignty, resilience, and
competitiveness.â

We share the Commissionâs core framing that Europe must treat OSS not only as a âfreeâ input, but as strategic infrastructure that
requires sustained investment, stewardship, and secure hosting environments. This is especially true in AI, where open models and
open tooling are now central to innovation and diffusion. Verdaâs day-to-day work sits directly at this intersection: we operate
European AI infrastructure for training and inference, and we actively support open model deployment and optimization in
production environments.
â
Independent evidence consistently shows OSS underpins modern software supply chains. For example, as the call points out, the
Synopsys/Black Duck OSSRA reports repeatedly find open source components are present in the overwhelming majority of
codebases, and that security and lifecycle risks are widespread without systematic governance and maintenance support1.
To keep this response practical, we structure our input around three pillars: (i) Public-Sector Stewardship; (ii) Sustainable & Secure
Foundations; (iii) Market Integration & Scaling. Each pillar addresses strengths/weaknesses and barriers, added value for
public/private sectors, concrete EU-level measures, priority technology areas, and priority sectors.

Pillar 1 â Public-Sector Stewardship

âOpen by Default, Open by Design, Contribute Upstreamâ

Europe already has credible proof that public institutions can be effective stewards of open digital commons, moving beyond
adoption toward lifecycle governance, reuse, and upstream participation. At the EU level, the Commission has institutionalized this
approach through the European Commission Open Source Programme Office (EC OSPO) and the code.europa.eu collaboration
platform, anchoring âbuild in the openâ as an operational practice rather than an exception.2 3

At national and municipal level, multiple Member States demonstrate that open source can serve as reusable public infrastructure.
X-Road4, used nationwide in Estonia and in Finlandâs Suomi.fi data exchange layer, shows that âopen by designâ can underpin
mission-critical cross-organisation interoperability at scale. Germanyâs Corona Warn App5 illustrates how open development can
strengthen public trust and enable scrutiny in high-sensitivity systems, supported by structured security engagement from the
federal cybersecurity authority. Europe also has repeatable âopen public service deliveryâ patterns: Franceâs beta.gouv.fr has
normalized fast, iterative public service building with an explicit emphasis on publishing code, while civic-tech efforts such as
Barcelonaâs Decidim6 demonstrate how municipalities can create exportable building blocks for democratic participation, turning
local investment into reusable assets that can travel across borders.

These strengths are reinforced by Europeâs deeper, globally proven track record of originating open technologies that became part
of the worldâs default digital infrastructure. The Linux7 kernel, initiated by Finnish developer Linus Torvalds, remains a foundational
layer across servers, cloud platforms, and embedded systems, while KDE8, announced in 1996 by German developer Matthias
Ettrich, helped shape the open desktop ecosystem and the broader culture of community-governed development. Taken together,
these examples demonstrate that Europe can generate OSS with global gravitational pull; the question is not whether Europe can
lead, but how can EU institutions translate that capability into repeatable public-sector practice so that governments and
municipalities systematically procure, publish, and contribute to the open commons they depend on.

Crucially, these successes also point to a practical lesson for policy design: âopen by defaultâ only works when matched by durable
capacity for maintenance, security assurance, and operational continuity. Publishing code and contributing upstream are
necessary foundations, but public bodies and their suppliers need predictable support for vulnerability management, dependency
hygiene, secure build and release processes, and workable compliance pathways, especially as OSS increasingly underpins critical
services and AI-era software supply chains.

Suggestions for EU-level actions
       1.â Open-source-first in public development and procurement (with justified exceptions).â
           Make OSS the default for new public digital services where functionally equivalent options exist, to reduce lock-in and
           increase interoperability. Practical guidance and learning resources already exist at EU level and should be operationalized
           across Member States.9

     2.â âOpen by designâ publishing from the outset (not retroactive release).â
         Promote early licensing clarity, modular architectures, and documentation so that publicly funded software is reusable
         across municipalities and Member States, instead of costly retroactive open-sourcing.
     3.â Upstream-first participation policies for public administrations.â
         Create explicit mandates and budget lines for: feature contributions, maintenance, security fixes, and code review in the
         upstream projects governments depend on, so that public bodies share responsibility for the commons they rely on.
     4.â Institutional capacity: OSPOs across levels of government.â
         Expand the OSPO model (already promoted at EU level) into national and municipal governance as a practical way to
         professionalize OSS engagement, compliance, and contribution.
     5.â Reuse infrastructure and discovery at Single Market scale.
         Reinforce and modernize reuse/discovery mechanisms so public-sector code is easier to find, adopt, and sustain across
         borders.

The central shift is cultural as much as technical: governments and municipalities should not be merely âusers of open source,â but
active participants helping to steward a shared digital commons, making choices that prioritize durability, auditability,
interoperability, and long-term resilience. This does not imply public ownership of open source, but rather a commitment to
contribute upstream, fund the improvements the public sector depends on, and strengthen the communities and governance
structures that sustain critical projects. Once that shared stewardship mindset is in place, the remaining barrier becomes clear:
Europe must ensure the commons is sustainably maintained and secured, because openness without maintenance is not
resilience.

Pillar 2 â Sustainable & Secure Foundations

Fund the middle: maintenance, security engineering, and compliance
enablement

Europe will not achieve technological sovereignty by funding only the beginning of the open-source lifecycle. The strategic
bottleneck is the âmiddleâ: sustained maintenance, security engineering, documentation, release discipline, and practical
compliance enablement, especially where OSS underpins critical services, industrial products, and public-sector systems.

Recent history demonstrates why this matters. The XZ Utils compromise (CVE-2024-3094)10 demonstrated how a determined actor
can embed malicious code into a widely trusted OSS component, leveraging maintainer trust and release processes to create the
potential for downstream unauthorized access, and prompting official guidance to downgrade to uncompromised versions11. This

is not an anomaly; ENISAâs threat landscape work continues to identify supply-chain attacks as a prime and evolving threat
category, reflecting the reality that modern services inherit risk through deep, transitive dependency chains.12

Other global-scale incidents underline the systemic nature of this exposure. The Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) in
Apache Log4j triggered active, widespread exploitation and led to coordinated EU-level assessment and guidance by the European
Commission, ENISA, CERT-EU and the CSIRTs Network, illustrating how a single widely used dependency can become a cross-sector
security event.13. Earlier, Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) in OpenSSL showed how flaws in foundational cryptographic libraries can
jeopardize confidentiality across internet communications, with immediate implications for both private and public services14. And
compromise can occur not only in libraries, but in the development pipeline itself: the Codecov Bash Uploader15 incident showed
how tampering with a widely used CI script could enable unauthorized data exfiltration from build environments, illustrating how
build tooling can become an attack vector in software supply-chain compromise16.

Together, these cases reinforce a simple conclusion: Europeâs open digital ecosystem will only be resilient if it systematically
strengthens the operational foundations in maintenance capacity, secure build and release practices, dependency transparency,
and scalable assurance mechanisms, rather than relying on voluntary effort and fragmented, one-off interventions.

Suggestions for EU-level actions

     1.â Create a dedicated EU maintenance plus security funding stream (multi-year, beyond R&D).â
         Ring-fence support for maintainer capacity, release engineering, documentation, testing, and long-term governance, the
         work that determines whether OSS remains deployable and trustworthy. This is economically justified. The Commissionâs
         open source impact study links OSS to significant positive EU economic impact and indicates that increased contributions
         correlate with measurable GDP and start-up effects.17
     2.â Provide EU-backed assurance services: âsecurity + compliance as a serviceâ for critical OSS.â
         Make recurring assurance practical and accessible by funding third-party audits, continuous testing, and coordinated
         vulnerability disclosure support, alongside reusable documentation templates and reference security practices. ENISAâs

         work emphasizes that secure outcomes depend on the ability to develop and maintain secure software across the supply
         chain, not only on point-in-time checks.18
     3.â Operationalize software supply-chain integrity as a baseline capability.â
         The lesson from incidents like XZ and Log4Shell is that resilience depends on verifiable release processes and dependency
         transparency at scale. EU support should help projects and adopters implement SBOM generation/consumption, artifact
         signing and verification, hardened CI, and, where applicable, practical incident-response playbooks, so the âcost of doing
         the right thingâ is not pushed onto volunteer maintainers.
     4.â Implement Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) guidance in a way that protects OSS sustainability and reduces uncertainty.â
         The CRA explicitly adopts a special approach to free and open-source software given its central role; implementation
         should prioritize clarity and low-friction guidance (including around steward concepts), so legal ambiguity does not
         become a de facto barrier to contribution and reuse. 19
     5.â Treat sovereign hosting and compute access as part of the OSS security/sustainability stack (including AI).â
         For AI-era OSS, compute is a gating resource for CI/testing at scale, benchmarking, evaluation, and rapid response when
         vulnerabilities emerge. The EU should ensure EU-based projects can access secure, sustainable compute and build/test
         infrastructure so openness can be maintained at production-grade security and reliability levels within Europe. Verdaâs
         published work on inference optimization illustrates this broader point: performance and reliability improvements in open
         inference stacks are realized through iterative benchmarking and tuning on real infrastructure, not âin the abstract.â

The lesson from XZ, Log4Shell, and other supply-chain compromises is not that open source is inherently unsafe. It is that
under-resourced open source can become a systemic vulnerability. Europe should therefore treat widely relied-upon OSS as
strategic digital infrastructure: maintained, secured, and continuously assured with predictable capacity, not left solely to
under-funded voluntary effort and fragmented interventions. This is also a sovereignty question: if Europe depends on open
components that it does not help sustain, and relies on non-EU platforms to build, test, and distribute them, then Europe remains
structurally dependent even when the code is âopen.â With sustainable maintenance and assurance foundations in place, Europe
can then focus on the adoption side of the lifecycle, reducing market friction so that high-quality open solutions can be discovered,
evaluated, procured, deployed, and supported at scale across the Single Market.

Pillar 3 â Market Integration & Scaling

Back openness without lowering the bar
Europe should back openness without lowering standards. The goal is globally excellent OSS and open digital products, adopted
because they are competitive, trustworthy, and straightforward to procure, deploy, and operate. This aligns with the Commissionâs
framing that the forthcoming strategy must support the full lifecycle âfrom development to market integration,â and that research
programmes alone have been insufficient to scale solutions in the face of barriers such as limited access to growth capital and
essential infrastructure.

Market integration, in practice, is about reducing friction and increasing repeatability: making it easier for public administrations
and European industry to discover proven solutions, assess them consistently, adopt them across borders, and sustain them over
time. Europe already has building blocks for this, such as the Interoperable Europe Portal and Joinupâs reuse mechanisms20. Yet,
these need to be operationalized at scale with clearer pathways to a deployable standard component. The Digital Commons EDIC
provides a concrete vehicle for cross-border operationalisation, including explicit commitments to maintenance and scaling
support, non-discriminatory access (including test and experimentation facilities), and a default rule that jointly developed
software is released under Free and Open-Source licenses.

This pillar also matches the competitiveness logic in the Draghi report: Europe must concentrate resources where scale and impact
are achievable, reduce administrative friction, and move faster from innovation to deployment21. Those principles apply directly to
OSS market integration, particularly in cloud and AI, where the speed of iteration and operational maturity determine whether
European solutions become defaults or remain pilots.

Suggestions for EU-level actions
       1.â âEarned preferenceâ in procurement and adoption: reward quality, openness, and operational maturity.â
           Public procurement should prioritize European OSS and open solutions when they meet or exceed functional and security
           requirements versus alternatives, thereby rewarding excellence and preventing lock-in, without forcing administrations
           into inferior tools. In practice, this means assessing solutions through a lifecycle lens: total cost of ownership (including
           maintenance), interoperability and open standards, auditability and supply-chain transparency, credible exit options
           (portability), and demonstrated operational reliability rather than treating license price as the primary signal. This
           approach reinforces sustainable, high-quality public digital infrastructure while keeping competition global and standards
           high.
       2.â Commercialization and adoption support: fund the âlast mile,â not only research.â
           If barriers include limited access to growth capital and essential infrastructure, then EU measures should directly support
           productization through documentation, user experience work, integration work, reference deployments, and support
           models, so that European OSS can compete with polished proprietary stacks and be adopted at lower operational cost.
       3.â Cross-border operationalisation through the Digital Commons EDIC.â
           Use the Digital Commons EDIC to turn proven OSS into deployable building blocks with shared services, reference stacks,
           reusable components, and common governance models, supported by one-stop-shop expertise, legal/technical scaling
           support, and accessible test facilities.
       4.â Reduce friction, focus priorities, and reward outcomes.â
           Concentrate funding and program design on a smaller set of high-leverage components and measurable adoption
           outcomes (reuse across borders, operational maturity, maintained releases), consistent with the Draghi competitiveness
           emphasis on focus, speed, and scale.

        non-discriminatory access to test/experimentation facilities.â

Sectors where OSS can most increase competitiveness and cyber resilience
    1.â Public administration and digital public services.
        The largest lever for demand-shaping, reuse, and long-term stewardship capacity.
    2.â Healthcare, energy, and other essential/critical services.
        Strong resilience payoffs from auditable components and consistent supply-chain assurance.
    3.â Industrial manufacturing and advanced engineering.
        Where interoperability, edge/HPC, and supply-chain integrity are increasingly central to productivity and resilience.
    4.â Defence / dual-use public workloads (where legally appropriate).
        Demand for sovereign, controlled infrastructure and verifiable software supply chains is structurally high.

Closing

Verda supports a European strategy that treats OSS as strategic digital infrastructure. This is not only because it underpins the
digital economy, but because Europeâs current dependency on non-EU technologies is increasingly a competitiveness, resilience,
and sovereignty constraint. The Commissionâs intent to support the entire open source lifecycle from development through
maintenance and sustainability to market integration is therefore the right framing, especially given the identified barriers around
scale-up capacity, access to growth capital, and access to essential infrastructure.

Across our three pillars, we recommend a coherent package of measures:

    1.â Public-sector stewardship (Pillar 1).
        Make âopen by default, open by designâ practical and repeatable. Publish publicly funded software early, contribute
        upstream, and professionalize engagement through OSPO-like capacity and reuse mechanisms.
    2.â Sustainable and secure foundations (Pillar 2).

Verda Cloud Oyâ                                                                                                                        8
         Treat widely relied-upon OSS as strategic digital infrastructure by funding the âmiddleâ (maintenance, security
         engineering, release discipline), operationalizing supply-chain integrity (SBOMs, signed releases, secure CI), and
         implementing CRA guidance in a way that reduces uncertainty without pushing disproportionate burden onto
         maintainers.
    3.â Market integration and scale (Pillar 3).
         Back openness without lowering the barâuse âearned preferenceâ adoption pathways that reward security,
         interoperability, and operational maturity; fund productisation and integration; and use cross-border instruments like the
         Digital Commons EDIC to turn proven OSS into deployable, governed building blocks.

This is also why we emphasize sovereign hosting and compute access as part of the ecosystemâs enabling infrastructure: in AI-era
OSS, performance, safety testing, evaluation, and incident response depend on sustained access to real infrastructure for
CI/testing, benchmarking, and deployment hardening.

We appreciate that this initiative is intended to complement the forthcoming Cloud and AI Development Act and to build on
existing EU instruments and programs. We remain available to provide additional operational evidence as the Commission finalizes
the strategy.
