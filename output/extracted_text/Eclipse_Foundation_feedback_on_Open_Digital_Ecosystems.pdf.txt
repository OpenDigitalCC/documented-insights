Contribution from the Eclipse Foundation to the Call
for Evidence âTowards European Open Digital
Ecosystemsâ
We welcome the opportunity to contribute to the European Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy.
Open source software is a key enabler of Europeâs technological sovereignty, competitiveness
and digital resilience. By reducing strategic dependencies, increasing transparency and
strengthening security and interoperability, open source provides a practical foundation for
resilient European digital value chains across critical sectors.

The Eclipse Foundation is a Brussels-based, international non-profit association that provides a
vendor-neutral and business-friendly environment for open source collaboration and innovation.
With more than 400 active projects and over 300 member organisations, it is the largest open
source foundation headquartered in Europe. Through strong governance, legal certainty and
long-term stewardship, the Foundation supports European developers, industries, SMEs,
research institutions, and public administrations in engaging effectively with open source
technologies.

The following points are based on the practical experience of building, governing and sustaining
large-scale open source initiatives with European stakeholders. Together, they reflect the view
that open source is not only a policy choice, but a strategic instrument for innovation,
competitiveness and technological sovereignty.

Open source as a strategic lever for European industry

European industry needs to strengthen its ability to use open source and open collaboration as
a strategic lever for innovation, competitiveness and global leadership. Over the past two
decades, US industry has successfully used free and open source software to disrupt existing
proprietary models, allowing new companies to emerge and grow to world leaders.

Europe has the industrial depth and talent to follow a similar path, but this requires a shift in
mindset: from viewing open source primarily as a cost-saving option or in certain cases
technically superior, to recognising it as a powerful mechanism that gives full authorisation to
every company, government body, and user to audit, examine and learn about every part of the

system, and also the possibility to create a related commercial product or service based on the
software or their modified version thereof.. Open source allows European entities to co-invest in
shared platforms, reduce duplication, and compete globally on differentiated products and
services built on common frameworks.

Digital sovereignty is an engineering challenge

Achieving digital and technological sovereignty requires sustained attention to engineering
capacity, skills and critical infrastructure, alongside policy and regulatory action. Today, the
development, building (compilation) and maintenance of virtually all modern software relies on
open source components distributed through a small number of central package management
ecosystems and repositories, including npm for JavaScript, Maven Central for Java, and PyPI
for Python. These infrastructures underpin the entire software supply chain and are
predominantly hosted, governed and operated outside the European Union.

A loss of access to, or disruption of, these services, whether due to geopolitical developments,
legal constraints, security incidents or operational failures, would immediately affect Europeâs
ability to build, update and secure software systems across both industry and public
administrations, with potentially paralysing consequences for critical operations. Freedom of
action therefore depends not only on access to source code, but on having European-based
capabilities to build, distribute, secure and maintain the open source software that is used in
Europe. Strengthening Europeâs technological sovereignty requires concrete action to establish
and sustain trusted European mirrors or equivalents of critical open source infrastructure,
including package repositories and dependency management services, so that European actors
can ensure the stability and resilience of the software foundations on which their economies and
public services depend.

Open source is a foundation for security and resilience

Open source software has proven itself to be an extremely effective way to build and maintain
complex, long-lived software systems securely and efficiently. Transparency, peer review and
shared maintenance significantly improve software quality, resilience and supply chain security
when supported by proper governance and professional processes.

However, security does not emerge automatically from openness. It requires sustained
investment in maintenance, audits, vulnerability handling and infrastructure. These activities are

critical for the public interest, yet they often lack direct short-term commercial incentives, making
them particularly well suited for targeted public support.

In this context, the Eclipse Foundation, as a major open source steward in Europe, is committed
to supporting Europeâs objectives, including initiatives such as the Cyber Resilience Act. This
commitment is reflected in particular through the Open Regulatory Compliance (ORC)
Working Group, which brings together industry and community stakeholders to translate
regulatory requirements into shared, practical open source governance, security and
compliance processes. By addressing compliance at ecosystem level, the Foundation helps
reduce fragmentation and duplication of effort, while also lowering the compliance burden for
individual developers and organisations.

There has been much discussion of an EU or European âSovereign Tech Fundâ (STF). Others
have gone into detail on this topic and we think they have covered the proposal quite well. In
supporting this idea, we would add that Eclipse Foundation has been very successful in using a
targeted amount of EU funding to organise the coordination of a group of European automotive
companies to collaborate on a base set of software components for the vehicles of today and
the future.

The ORC Working Group is also an example of how collaboration can reduce the compliance
burden of all companies in a sector, and it thus is a prime example of where investment from an
EU STF could create value in a very effective way. European businesses may also appreciate
that when the EU creates new compliance obligations, this is coupled with investment in
collaborative structures to work on efficient paths to compliance.

Building European-led stacks without reinventing the wheel

Europe should not attempt to rewrite all software from scratch, nor withdraw from global
ecosystems, and where possible we should prevent duplicative work. Three companies writing
software for the same task will have higher costs and probably lower quality compared to three
companies pooling their talent to produce a single software package. Instead, the objective
should be to build and sustain European-led stacks that enable Europe to master its digital
destiny, preserve freedom of action and exercise leadership within global open source
ecosystems. This requires not only access to open source software, but also a strong base of
skilled developers and organisations capable of using, studying, modifying and sharing
critical open source components. Such capabilities are essential to contribute actively to

upstream projects and, where necessary, to ensure continuity, security and long-term resilience
through maintenance or adaptation.

The Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) initiative is a concrete example of this approach,
bringing together European automotive players to co-develop an open, industrial-grade software
stack that supports competitiveness, interoperability and innovation across the automotive value
chain. Satisfaction among European companies is high and the investment is quite efficient.

From standards to platforms: a necessary evolution

Europe has rightly invested in developing global standards and has achieved significant
success. In software, however, standards alone are no longer sufficient. Over the last 20 years,
global leadership has increasingly been shaped by open source platforms and the ecosystems
that form around them.

Open source platforms accelerate standardisation, drive adoption and create network effects
that translate directly into innovation capacity and economic value. Europeâs open source
strategy should therefore place platform creation and stewardship at its core, complementing
standards with shared, production-grade software foundations led and governed by European
actors. Over the last few years, the Eclipse Foundation has demonstrated, through its ISO/IEC
JTC 1 PAS Submitter status, that specifications designed in public and supported by compatible
implementations from day one, significantly improve interoperability and adoption, effectively
bridging the gap between formal standardisation and real-world deployment.

Standards are effective if they are implemented. Open source software allows all entities, public
and private, to audit the standards compliance of the software and to modify the software for
any purpose, including for the implementation of European standards.

The role of public funding and infrastructure

Public funding can play a decisive role by supporting the shared infrastructure that open source
ecosystems depend on, such as repositories, package managers, build and distribution
systems, security services and long-term maintenance. Strengthening Europeâs technological
sovereignty requires sustained support for EU-based organisations capable of operating and
stewarding critical open source infrastructure.

Public investment should focus on components and services that are essential for ecosystem
sustainability and sovereignty but do not deliver immediate commercial returns for individual

stakeholders. In this context, existing European organisations, like Software Heritage, the
Eclipse Foundation, the EDIC for Digital Commons, and others, are well positioned to
support the build and operation of such critical open digital infrastructure. Targeted public
support can strengthen their capacity to deliver long-term value for European industry, research
and public administrations in a coordinated and sustainable manner.

The move to free and open source software affects and can benefit all parts of an organisation.
Open Source Programme Offices (OSPOs) have proven to be an effective tool to ease the
transition. We have a positive experience in working with the EC OSPO and many other OSPOs
in the public sector. As the use of open source grows, it seems logical to expand the resources
available to these OSPOs. Eclipse Foundation also has a lot of experience in creating networks,
including a network of OSPOs: the OSPO Alliance. A formalised network of public sector
OSPOs in the EU could be a great enabler of knowledge and efficiency and we would be very
happy to discuss collaboration between this network and the OSPO Alliance.

On this topic, we should note that there is a difference between the EU and certain other
countries, the US in particular. While other countries provide tax efficient ways to support free
and open source software, such as tax breaks for donations to non-profits, the same is not true
in the Member States of the EU. While this is not a topic we have studied extensively, we can
confirm that it is much harder to raise money from European companies compared to US
companies. Although the EU cannot decide the tax policy of Member States, we think it could be
useful to perform a study of this situation with the aim of producing a document which Member
States may find informative if they were to decide to examine their taxation policy.

Protecting the integrity of open source

Finally, it is essential to avoid âopen washingâ. Policies and funding schemes should clearly
distinguish genuine open source software from models that merely use open rhetoric. Open
source should be understood and supported in line with the Open Source Definition as
maintained by the Open Source Initiative, ensuring legal clarity, trust and long-term ecosystem
health. â       â       â
