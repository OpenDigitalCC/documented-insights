PURPOSE
This submission provides 17+ years of evidence of structural failure in European innovation
policy: the absence of mechanisms to identify, evaluate, and sustain postgraduate-originated
open-source projects with demonstrated public value.

FINDINGS
Structural exclusion: EU architectures are institution-centric. Citizen-originated projects
have no pathway for recognition or support, regardless of outcomes.
Evaluation misalignment: Generalist administrative structures lack competence to assess
technical open-source geospatial citizen science systems.
Allocation inefficiency: This produces funding decisions that are inadequate and
measurably wasteful by orders of magnitude.
Democratic deficit: The absence of pathways for citizen-generated digital public goods
contradicts EU commitments to participatory democracy and digital sovereignty.
Member State failure: Ireland, ahead of its EU Council Presidency (JulyâDecember 2026),
cannot identify a single citizen-originated digital public good.

EVIDENCE: OPENLITTERMAP
OpenLitterMap is an open-source geospatial platform enabling citizens to map
environmental data in real-time with research origins in 2008 and has been operating
continuously since 2017.
Outcomes: 500k+ uploads, 850k+ tags, 110+ countries, 101 peer-reviewed citations, UN
Digital Public Good validation, open code (GPL), open data (ODbL).
Support received: Zero funding, Zero PhDs, Zero Research or Innovation opportunities,
200+ funding applications submitted, â¬100,000 personal investment, 17+ years duration.

COST-EFFICIENCY COMPARISON
 Project                             Funding             Outputs     Cost/Item
 Plastic Pirates (EU-funded)         â¬2.0m               93,718      â¬21.34
 BluePointProject.eu                 â¬3.3m               ?           ?
 OpenLitterMap (self-funded)         â¬0.1m               850,000+    â¬0.12
The unfunded project is 178Ã more cost-efficient.
Current frameworks fail to identify high-efficiency alternatives already operating at scale.
DEMOCRATIC IMPLICATIONS
Six billion people carry data collection devices disguised as fashionable entertainment
accessories. European response: no training, no civic infrastructure, no pathways for citizen
contribution. This is the biggest public health, education, and security blunder in the 21st
century that contradicts commitments to digital sovereignty and falls within the Democracy
Commissioner's mandate and constituency.

REQUESTED ACTIONS
1. Direct funding pathways for citizen-originated projects without institutional consortiums.
2. Domain-competent evaluation for funding applications.
3. Cost-per-outcome as explicit funding criteria.
4. Formal acknowledgment that current architectures structurally exclude citizen-originated
innovation.â
5. Inclusion of citizen-led citizen science activities in Irelandâs EU Presidency.
