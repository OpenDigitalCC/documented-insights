Towards European open digital ecosystems
In this document, âLTâ abbreviates Libre Technology, meaning software and hardware which gives
everyone the freedom to use, distribute, study, and modify it. Machine-learning-based systems (âAIâ)
are not considered LT since their behavior can not be reasonably studied even if their training data,
code, and weights are freely accessible.

Direct Support for LT
One of the main problems preventing more LT development is that it is difficult to get income from
LT contributions, meaning many contributors only contribute in their free time, and other people
who are interested in contributing refrain from doing so due to financial constraints. This situation
could be improved in various ways.
Existing direct support for LT, such as provided via NLnet or the German Sovereign Tech Fund, is
helpful and should be expanded at a European level. Support should not be limited to feature
development, but also include maintenance and documentation efforts, which are essential for
healthy technology.
While many users primarily care about the user-facing software they run, it is important to liberate
the whole technology stack, including libraries, frameworks, programming languages and their
tooling, operating systems, firmware, and importantly also hardware. A critical weakness of Europe
is the lack of a European institution which has the capability to produce hardware. While ASML is
based in Europe, we do not have European foundries using their advanced lithography machines to
make competitive chips.
Public institutions should pay LT developers instead of paying license fees for proprietary
technology. This could be done via direct employment or contracting. For a lot of technology, it
makes sense to have dedicated individuals and institutions who specialize in a certain technology,
and then get paid via support contracts to work on LT. This is a much better use of public funds than
spending them on license fees, since the result of the work will be publicly accessible for everyone,
meaning access to the technology cannot be revoked, and there is much less lock-in, since anyone
would be allowed to continue working on the technology.
For publicly-funded research and development, the results must be freely accessible to the public.
This should be facilitated by government-provided platforms, where the results need to be uploaded,
and can then be viewed freely by the public. These platforms could also offer free services for
developers, such as hosting of version-control, issue trackers, continuous integration, web hosting,
and software distribution. Much of this is currently offered by large corporations like Microsoft (via
GitHub). Having alternatives allows developers to stop relying on their proprietary offerings which
could be taken away at any moment. LT for this already exists, but it needs hardware resources to be
deployed, which is something which many smaller LT communities do not want to deal with.
LT would also benefit from improving incentives for continuing development of technology at
academic institutions beyond the usual proofs-of-concept.
Many LT developers are not keen on interacting with bureaucratic processes. Finding ways to
support them would be useful. One important step would be to make it easier to receive donations
for LT work, which is currently practically impossible in some countries in the EU.
The EU should also focus on supporting payment methods which provide anonymity for the payer,
like GNU Taler. Protecting the payer from being spied on is essential to protect personal freedom
and thus would result in much better acceptance by potential users. At the same time, such a system
still allows for taxation of the payees. Having such a system is essential for breaking the dependency
on private oligopolist digital payment providers.
Standards
Standards are essential for collaboration. For something to be considered a proper standard, it needs
to be freely accessible to the public, which is especially important for standards required in laws.
Having laws which mention standards which cannot be freely viewed by the public violate the
fundamental right to read and understand the law, and it reinforces the position of existing players
in the space by making it harder for new players to participate, reducing or even eliminating
competition.

Personal Rights
A free society is essential for a strong LT community. At the moment, there is a worrying trend in
the EU and many of its members to reduce freedom by increasing surveillance and undermining
privacy rights, such as Chat Control. This greatly harms society as a whole, but the LT community is
particularly affected, both because many of its members personally care about freedom a lot, and
because the technology they work on is negatively affected. Personally, I consider this one of the
greatest threats to society, and I am seriously considering leaving the EU over it. Some great LT
projects have already made moves to leave the EU, such as GrapheneOS recently withdrawing from
France, while others, such as Signal, have made it clear that they will leave the EU if Chat Control
becomes law.
It is vital that this repressive trend is reversed, lest we repeat some of the darkest chapters of history,
only this time with vastly more powerful technology. Personal privacy and data protection need to
be strengthened instead of undermined. Respect Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of
the EU and Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To be even more explicit, add a
fundamental right to secure cryptography including securely end-to-end-encrypted communication
at the European level. This includes the right to not run spyware. Equipping law enforcement
agencies with mass surveillance technology is asking for abuse and will inevitably result in police
states.

Regulations for Organizations
In order to ensure European sovereignty and the success of LT, it will be necessary to take
regulatory action.

Data Processing and Storage
The GDPR was a good step towards better data protection. Its protections need to be expanded,
rather than weakened as currently proposed in the Digital Omnibus. Do not reduce the scope of
what is considered personal data, and preserve existing limitations on how it may be processed.
The EU should ban processing of personal data by âAIâ systems, including for training. Only LT can
be considered secure. Proprietary technology cannot be properly audited and vendors could
introduce vulnerabilities or other undesirable behavior, and it would be very hard or even impossible
to notice. Additionally, and identified problems cannot be fixed without cooperation from the
vendor. Therefore, it must be required by law that processing and storage of personal data may only
happen when exclusively using LT for it. Proprietary technology must not be able to access any
personal data. For this to be enforceable, processors of personal data must disclose all technology
they use for processing personal data.
It is also essential that personal data does not leave the EU, which means that it must be stored in
the EU, by a European organization. Non-EU organizations storing personal data, even if they claim
that they only store it in the EU, is unacceptable, since they could at any time be compelled by their
governments to hand over data. In the USA specifically, the CLOUD Act is designed to force
companies to provide the government access to their data regardless of storage location.
To avoid lock-in and overcome network effects, data portability using open standards needs to be
mandated. Large providers of communication systems, such as âsocialâ media providers, should be
forced to federate, making content from one platform accessible on the others. Users should have the
right and capability to use a client of their own choosing to connect to these services. These clients
need to be able to provide their own way of filtering and prioritizing content, to the same extent that
the platformâs own software is capable of doing so. This includes the capability to use custom
recommendation algorithms.
One massive problem faced by small providers who host user-uploaded content is being criminalized
for illegal content. While it should be required to remove illegal content reasonably quickly after
being made aware of it, the providers should not have to proactively prevent the upload of
potentially illegal content. Such upload filters cannot be reasonably implemented. Manual filtering
takes substantial resources which small providers often do not have access to. Automated filtering
does not work and would result in false negatives, which would criminalize the providers. Trying to
mitigate this by making filters stricter would result in large amounts of legal content being filtered,
amounting to automated censorship. Therefore, the reasonable approach is to only penalize
providers if they fail to remove illegal content after being notified about it.
To take away a massive incentive for user tracking and general enshittification of the web,
personalized online advertising should be banned. That is, different advertisements may be shown
based on the content being viewed, but not based on who views it. To make this enforceable, require
that all technology used for showing ads needs to be LT and disclosed publicly. Alongside, ban the
use of user tracking technology, such as non-essential cookies. Collection of data not required for
performing user-desired actions should be illegal. The sale of personal data should be banned as
well.

Tenders
Tenders are an important process for procuring technology. It should be legal to require LT in
tenders and to exclude non-EU participants when hosting is involved. In some cases, LT might not
currently be available for satisfying a tender. To help with eventually transitioning to LT in these
cases, public tenders should require that if proprietary technology is used, a fixed percentage of the
amount of money paid to the winner of the tender must also be spent on developing an LT
alternative. This may not be done by the winner of the tender. Instead, the money must be given to
an independent organization which does not have conflicts of interest regarding the development of
an LT alternative. The amount given to LT development should exceed the amount spent on
proprietary technology, such that more resources are available for LT development, allowing the LT
to become better than the proprietary alternative.

Right to Repair
Unfortunately, we have laws preventing us from freely studying, repairing, and modifying
technology. These laws must be abolished. The result would be significantly improved competition.
Instead of companies holding their customers hostage, everyone would be allowed to repair
technology and modify it to better suit the users.
In addition to legal barriers, companies also try to prevent this by intentionally preventing their
products from working if independent repairs or modifications were performed. One recent high-
profile case of this is the Polish train company Newag preventing trains they sold from starting after
an independent workshop performed maintenance on the trains. The company which performed the
maintenance then contacted security researchers who managed to work around the restrictions built
into the trains by Newag and got the trains working again. As a result, nothing happened to Newag,
but the security researchers are faced with multiple lawsuits, which is absurd and appalling.
Similarly, John Deere remotely bricked agricultural machines after Russia stole them from Ukraine.
While this particular case might not be particularly objectionable, it shows the immense risk we are
exposed to due to digital restrictions management. At the press of a button, companies can severely
disrupt our food supply or transportation infrastructure, and then take legal action against the
people who try to get us out of the resulting disaster.
To prevent this, researchers must have better legal protection. In addition, we need to stop accepting
the practice of DRM entirely. Any hardware sold needs to be usable with fully LT software,
including firmware. This means that if the device is sold with software, or requires them to operate,
LT software must be provided by the vendor. In order for it to really be free, it must be possible to
run modified versions of the firmware and software on the device, so requiring that software is
signed by the vendor is not permissible. It also means that any compilers or other tools required for
building and installing the software and modified versions of it must be provided by the hardware
vendor.

Education
Education is essential for helping LT adoption. At the moment, most educational institutions are
immensely reliant on proprietary technology. This is a problem for the institutions themselves, due
to all the reasons proprietary technology is problematic, but in addition the students will become
familiar with proprietary technology instead of LT alternatives, which makes them much more
likely to continue using this proprietary technology outside the educational institutions.
One major contributor to this is the anti-competitive practice of offering proprietary technology at a
large discount or even for free to these institutions. While it may seem benign, or even charitable at
the surface, it is an insidious method employed by proprietary technology vendors to create a
dependency on them.
Therefore, it is especially important that proprietary technology is kept out of educational
institutions. The institutions should be banned from using proprietary technology, even if it is
available free of charge.
Curricula should be updated to teach students about LT and its numerous benefits. This should not
only focus on concrete technologies, but importantly on the broader impact and philosophy of LT.
To help any potential LT adopters, training material and courses could be offered, either by public
institutions directly, or by offering funding for it. To work well, this effort needs to be built upon
good documentation, so supporting the creation and maintenance of documentation is crucial.

Licensing
LT needs to be clearly defined. As a reaction to the Free Software philosophy, proprietary
technologist came up with the term âOpen Sourceâ, which is nowadays unfortunately often used
interchangeably by many people. But there is a fundamental difference in the stance on technology
these terms communicate. The core idea of freedom to use, distribute, study, and modify technology
should be emphasized in communication and legislation.
Technology is made available under specific licenses. When determining acceptable licenses, it needs
to be ensured that the licenses grant all the aforementioned freedoms. There is also a notable
difference between licenses which only grant these freedoms (permissive) and licenses which
preserve the freedoms, so they cannot be taken away in modified versions (copyleft). The latter is
much better, since it prevents building proprietary technology on top of LT.
Decentralization
Centralized systems are brittle and prone to disruption. For resiliency, it is important to build
decentralized systems which allow individual parts to fail while the rest of the system can continue
to operate and fulfill its purpose. This approach not only limits the impact of accidental failures, but
also makes it much harder for hostile actors to disrupt systems. If failures happen, their impact will
be much more limited, so the widespread outages caused by large cloud providers or Cloudflare
would be a thing of the past.
At the moment, there are several highly centralized gatekeepers of LT, such as software distribution
platforms, or, ironically, the proprietary, Microsoft-controlled platform GitHub, on which a large part
of LT collaboration happens. To improve this situation, alternatives with sufficient resources need to
be available. Federation and content mirroring are ways to decentralize systems and to make them
fault-tolerant. To help break network effects, force large platforms to federate with anyone who
wants to. The EU could offer resources and funding to help with development and operation of LT
alternatives.
If the EU decides to support LT, supporting only a single implementation for solving a problem
would also result in a form of centralization. Instead, focus on supporting standards with which
multiple implementations can all work together. Then, it also makes sense to support more than one
implementation. While this will undoubtedly cause some duplicated effort, it will result in a resilient
ecosystem, which is welcoming to new implementations, stimulating competition. Having multiple
options available already is a strength of LT and one of the many reasons why people like it.
It should also be noted that LT development is globally distributed, which is good and it should be
kept that way. While having a European strategy for LT makes sense, the strategy should not
exclude non-EU LT contributors. The great thing about LT is that everyone can come together to
work on it, and everyone can enjoy the results.

Legislative Process
In order to take meaningful action regarding LT and achieve good results, it is essential to actively
involve experts in the field into the legislative and other processes. Experts are the people who work
with LT, not lobbyists from proprietary technology companies who are incentivized to sabotage LT
efforts. Decades of ignoring experts who want to improve society and listening to lobbyists aiming
to increase the profits of private companies has resulted in the current situation of extreme
dependence on private entities, which cripples our sovereignty. Finally listen to LT experts and
allow us to get out of the current proprietary disaster and build free technology for a free society.
