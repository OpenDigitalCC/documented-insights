Extended Contribution: Towards a Sovereign Industrial Open Source Policy

From: Dr. Monique Calisti, CEO, Martel Innovate

Subject: Transitioning from Grassroots Support to a Sovereign Industrial Open Source Policy

Preamble: A Legacy of Building European Foundations

Martel Innovateâs contribution is grounded in a deep-rooted history of building the very foundations
of European open digital ecosystems. We do not just advocate for open source; we live it.

    â¢   Architectural Legacy: Key members of the Martel team, including our CIO Dr. Giovanni
        Rimassa, were among the original creators of JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework).
        JADE remains one of the worldâs most successful open-source agent middleware, proving our
        ability to build AI-based software that survives and scales for decades.

    â¢   Operational Commitment: Martel leads by example, deploying open-source software like
        Odoo to run our corporate operations and Nextcloud for secure collaboration. By using open
        source to run our business, we ensure our own digital sovereignty and avoid the vendor lock-
        in of global proprietary giants.

    â¢   Modern Leadership: This legacy continues through our driving role in FIWARE, our Orchestra
        Cities platform, and our coordination of strategic initiatives like EUCloudEdgeIoT.eu, NGI
        Commons, and Next Generation Open Source, besides direct collaboration with leaders like
        the SUSE, Eclipse Foundation, OW2, Apell, Linux Foundation Europe and RedHat.

    â¢   Technical Excellence in Projects: In our research and innovation projects, we utilize a
        professional open-source stackâincluding Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, and Open
        Policy Agent (OPA)âto build enterprise-grade, transparent, and auditable solutions for our
        partners.

1. The "European" Open Source Paradox: Governance over Geography

Open Source has no boundaries by definition. A strategic "European" approach must be defined by
Strategic Autonomy and Governance, not the origin of the code.

    â¢   Sovereignty of Governance: A project is "European" if its roadmap is governed by transparent,
        multi-stakeholder frameworks anchored in EU legal values. This prevents any single non-EU
        entity from unilaterally changing licenses or "unplugging" critical technology.

    â¢   Economic Retention: "Buying European" means investing in the local ecosystem of SMEs and
        experts who provide maintenance and customization. This keeps economic value and
        expertise within our borders.

2. Maintenance and Sustainability: The Bedrock of Cybersecurity

A major blind spot in current funding is the focus on "new" features over the maintenance of existing
foundations.

    â¢   Investing in Resilience: Cybersecurity is not a one-time patch; it is a continuous process of
        maintenance. Many critical European infrastructures rely on open-source libraries that are
        underfunded or maintained by volunteers.

    â¢   The Proposal: The EU must treat open-source maintenance as a strategic investment in
        cybersecurity. Directing funds toward the professionalized maintenance of core libraries is
        the most cost-effective way to reduce systemic vulnerabilities across the continent.

3. Living Hubs: Lowering Barriers via Coordination

Technology alone is not enough; we need the social and organizational glue to make it accessible.

    â¢   Strategic Coordination and Support Actions (CSAs): We advocate for the creation of "Living
        Hubs", dedicated coordination actions that act as mobilizers for both public and private
        organizations.

    â¢   The Role of Hubs: These hubs should grow awareness, provide technical and legal "help
        desks," and lower the barrier to entry for SMEs who may fear the complexity of open-source
        licensing or governance. They serve as the bridge between developers and industrial adopters.

4. Concrete Policy Levers for Market Transformation

    â¢   Public Procurement Reform: Procurement must favor open source by default and separate
        software costs from service/support costs. This empowers local SMEs to compete with global
        proprietary giants.

    â¢   Fiscal Incentives: We recommend tax deductions for European companies that transition to
        or actively contribute to sovereign open-source stacks.

    â¢   Education: Integrate open-source governance into core digital training to build a workforce
        capable of managing industrial-grade open digital ecosystems.

5. Realizing Autonomy: Beyond "Bragging" Against Big Tech

Regulation is a defensive tool; Open Source is an offensive strategy. The Commission has spent years
regulating Big Tech, yet our dependency has only increased. The only path to reducing this
dependency is to provide more competitive, sovereign alternatives. By treating open source as a
strategic industrial asset, the EU can build an auditable foundation immune to foreign vendor lock-in.

6. Regarding the EuroStack initiative, Martel Innovate views it as a necessary but high-risk ambition.
For it to succeed, it must avoid the trap of 'political protectionism.' A sovereign stack cannot be built
top-down by decree; it must be earned through technical excellence and developer experience. We
believe EuroStackâs role should be that of a curator and guarantor of interoperability, rather than a
creator of redundant tools. It should focus on the 'unglamorous' but vital work of ensuring that
diverse, best-of-breed European open-source componentsâfrom cloud-native infrastructure to AIâ
actually work together seamlessly at an industrial grade.

Conclusion:

Martel Innovate stands ready to help the EC move from "Open Source as a Research Topic" to "Open
Source as an Industrial Policy." By focusing on maintenance, coordination hubs, and SME
empowerment, Europe can finally turn its technical excellence into digital sovereignty.
