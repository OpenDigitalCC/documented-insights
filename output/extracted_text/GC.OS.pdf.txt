The German Center for Open Source AI is a Non-For-Profit with the goal to promote
democratically governed, sovereign European AI by a participative open source
approach. According to key open source KPIs, we are one of the leading, genuinely
European (not US dependent) organisations for open source AI software.

Our crucial role in Europe is unfortunately often overlooked by decision makers â and
played down with some success by adversarial lobbyists â due to âsupply chain
blindnessâ and âgovernance blindnessâ, etc, as discussed in point 1.

1. Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector; barriers to adoption,
maintenance, and sustainable contribution

Strengths

   â¢   The EU has strong technical talent, a long tradition of academic collaboration,
       and widespread use of open-source software across industry and public
       administration.

   â¢   There is broad political alignment around digital sovereignty, interoperability, and
       vendor-neutrality.

   â¢   Many EU companies build critical products and services on open-source
       components.

Weaknesses

   â¢   Supply chain blindness. Decision-makers tend to focus on visible applications,
       or AI âmodelsâ, while ignoring AI software libraries and distribution and software
       infrastructure (e.g. package repositories and CDNs such as PyPI administered by
       the US based, and tightly controlled Python Software Foundation). These layers
       are also overwhelmingly dependent on infrastructure and funding controlled by
       US hyperscalers, creating hidden but severe strategic dependencies that are not
       captured by current policy aims.

   â¢   Governance blindness. Open source is often treated as a monolith. In practice,
       governance models vary widely, and many âopen-sourceâ projects are effectively
       controlled by single companies or foundations with limited accountability, very
       often in the US. Ownership of trademarks, repositories, release processes, and
       infrastructure is rarely scrutinised, and âopen sourceâ is treated irrespective of
       governance. For instance, the German âSovereign Tech Fundâ directly funds US
       controlled projects

   â¢   Sustainability blindness, track record blindness. EU funding mechanisms
       prioritise novelty and research outputs over long-term maintenance, security
       hardening, track record, and operational continuity of widely-used open-source
       components. In particular, the track record of projects or applicants (e.g.,
       GitHub/OSS contribution record, number of downloads of packages) is routinely
       disregarded, in contrast to, say, academic credentials or bombastic claims. But
       funding a track record in sustainability is the most obvious way to ensure long-
       term sustainability of outcomes â similarly, a track record in delivery is the most
       obvious way to ensure delivery; and a publicly verifiable track record of
       competence is the most obvious way to ensure quality.

   â¢   Misallocation of funds via academia. Funding is frequently routed through
       academic institutions that lack actual AI competence, or operational
       competence in maintaining production-grade open-source infrastructure â more
       often than not glaringly visible through an inspection of public open-source track
       record (or lack thereof). This leads to fragmentation, short-term projects, and
       limited impact, while sidelining experienced maintainers. Also related to
       sustainability blindness: Projects created through academic grants often die
       immediately after funding ends.

Barriers

   â¢   No stable funding pathways for maintainers of critical open-source
       infrastructure.

   â¢   Misallocation of existing funding through barely controlled institutions such as
       the âSovereign Tech Fundâ, often academia or lobbyist influenced, along the
       above lines of âblindnessâ.

   â¢   Legal and procurement frameworks that do not distinguish between community-
       governed or public controlled projects on one side, and vendor-controlled or US-
       monopolist adjacent foundations on the other side. This is especially relevant
       when a project has a significant track record, but are covertly under US control.

   â¢   Procurement and grant award frameworks that completely disregard open-
       source track record.

   â¢   Over-reliance on non-EU infrastructure for distribution, CI/CD, and hosting of
       critical open-source assets, in particular content delivery networks such as the
       Python Package Index.

   â¢   There is a generally trend of US actors assuming direct control over the âblind
       spotsâ in the supply chain completely under the radar of the EU. This includes
       systemic attacks such as redirecting funding, and specific attacks at high-profile,
       EU-based or independent projects, up to creation of direct competitors or even
       targeted attacks at project infrastructure through abuse of supply chain
       dependencies or social engineering.

For comparison, China has long ago constructed their own parallel infrastructure and
has virtually no dependence on US controlled governance or distribution pathways.
2. Added value of open source for public and private sectors

Open source can deliver significant added value, but only when governance, control,
and infrastructure are properly understood.

Key sources of value

   â¢   Reduced lock-in: Open standards and open implementations reduce
       dependence on single vendors. However, this required addressing governance
       blindnes â and works only if the project is not de facto controlled by one company
       or US monopolists!

   â¢   Security and transparency: Open code enables inspection and audit, but this
       benefit collapses without funded maintenance, timely patching, and secure
       distribution channels!

   â¢   Innovation leverage: Open source accelerates innovation by allowing reuse of
       foundational components rather than duplicating effort. This advantage is only
       present if critical components are allowed to thrive.

   â¢   Cost efficiency: Upfront licensing costs are reduced, but long-term costs are
       often shifted onto unfunded maintainers or external actors. This advantage exists
       only under the open governance model: namely, if license changes or lock-in
       exploitation is prevented (e.g., as in the case of RedHat).

Concrete examples

   â¢   Widely used software stacks (e.g. PyTorch, NumFOCUS stack) underpin critical
       EU research and industrial systems, yet their sustainability depends on US-
       controlled infrastructure and corporate sponsorship.

   â¢   Public administrations adopting âopen-source solutionsâ often unknowingly rely
       on cloud services, CDNs, and build pipelines controlled by a handful of non-EU
       providers, re-introducing lock-in at a deeper layer. Vendors of âtaintedâ open-
       source of course are always happy to confirm how sovereign and independent
       their projects are.

3. Concrete EU-level measures to support open source, sovereignty, and
cybersecurity

The EU should move from symbolic support to structural intervention:

   1. Differentiate open-source governance models in policy and funding.
      Treat community-governed, asset-neutral projects differently from company-
      owned or US-controlled. Ownership of trademarks, repositories, infrastructure,
      and social control of communities, must be taken into account.
   2. Fund maintenance as critical infrastructure.
      Establish long-term funding instruments for maintainers of widely-used libraries,
      runtimes, and tools, independent of academic novelty cycles. Base this on track
      record in maintenance and sustainability rather than

   3. Secure the open-source supply chain.
      Invest in EU-based package distribution, mirrors, signing infrastructure, and CI
      systems for critical ecosystems. Most importantely, EU-based and completely
      independent mirrors of Python Software Foundation Infrastructure (e.g., PyPI)
      and secure build pipelines must be set up, similar to the Chinese ecosystem.

   4. Reduce dependence on hyperscalers and US venture capital networks.
      Avoid concentrating open-source infrastructure (hosting, CI, distribution) and de-
      facto package ownership on a small number of US-based providers.

   5. Reform procurement and compliance frameworks.
      Strictly require assessment of governance, control, and infrastructure
      dependencies when procuring or mandating open-source solutions. Strictly
      require track record checks when funding via grants.

4. Technology areas to prioritise

More priority should be given to foundational layers, not only end-user applications:

   â¢   Core software libraries and runtimes (e.g. data science, ML, AI, cryptography,
       networking).

   â¢   Software supply-chain infrastructure (package distribution and content delivery
       networks, package repositories, build systems, signing).

   â¢   Operating systems, virtualisation, and container ecosystems.

   â¢   Security-critical components (identity, encryption, update mechanisms).

These layers are widely reused, systemically important â yet they are almost exclusively
under US control, and currently underfunded relative to their strategic importance.

In all the above, both communities as well as technologies must be made resilient.

5. Sectors where increased open-source use could boost competitiveness and
cyber resilience

Anywhere, but especially in critical systems â e.g., public sector, healthcare, defense,
energy. Enough has already written about this by other parties in this call for evidence
(we do not disagree with the broad consensus).
