Call for Action:
European Open Digital Ecosystems
           by Diogo Vicente Mendes

1. Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector, and
barriers to adoption, maintenance, and sustainable contribution

Strengths

The EU open-source sector demonstrates strong technical depth in several
foundational areas, including digital infrastructure, security tooling, and standards-
based systems. Many projects benefit from proximity to research institutions, public
administrations, and regulated environments, which supports robustness and long-
term relevance.

The diversity of projects and governance models contributes to ecosystem resilience.
Unlike highly concentrated proprietary ecosystems, open-source development in the
EU is distributed across many actors, reducing single-point dependency and supporting
cross-border reuse when interoperability conditions are met.

Open source is structurally aligned with public sector needs where auditability,
modifiability, and long-term maintainability are important. When properly supported, it
enables administrations to retain technical visibility over systems that underpin public
services.

Weaknesses and structural gaps

A persistent weakness is the underfunding of maintenance, security hardening,
documentation, and governance work. These activities are essential to system reliability
but are often treated as voluntary or incidental, rather than as core infrastructure
functions.

Procurement and funding remain fragmented across Member States and institutions,
limiting continuity. Demand is often expressed through isolated projects rather than
sustained, coordinated support for shared components, which constrains long-term
planning and investment.

Adoption costs are often shifted onto public administrations. While code may be
available, many organisations lack the internal capacity to deploy, secure, and operate
it, leading to reliance on integrators who may themselves become new dependency
points, particularly where support contracts bundle operation, security, and roadmap
control.

Governance maturity varies widely. Some projects have well-defined stewardship,
security processes, and roadmaps, while others remain fragile due to concentration of
responsibility in a small number of maintainers.

Barriers to adoption and maintenance of high-quality, secure
open source

(i) Adoption and maintenance

Procurement frameworks frequently prioritise packaged solutions with clear liability
structures, even when this comes at the expense of long-term control. Evaluation
criteria often favour delivery certainty over auditability, substitutability, and exit
capacity.

Operational risk is sometimes perceived as higher for open source, particularly where
support models are unclear or internal skills are limited. This perception can persist
even when open solutions offer strong transparency and security properties.

Security assurance regimes are commonly designed around static products rather than
continuously evolving codebases and communities, creating a mismatch that
complicates adoption.

(ii) Sustainable contributions to open-source communities

There is a structural misalignment between beneficiaries and contributors. Public and
private actors may rely heavily on open-source components without contributing
resources upstream.

Funding cycles are typically short-term, whereas maintenance, security, and
governance require continuity. Essential work such as vulnerability triage, release
engineering, and documentation remains largely invisible and under-supported.

Reliance on a small number of maintainers creates systemic fragility within the
ecosystem itself, with burnout and turnover posing real risks to continuity.

2. Added value of open source for the public and private sectors

Added value for the public sector

Open source can strengthen exit capacity and substitutability. When systems are based
on open interfaces and formats, public administrations can change service providers
without losing operational continuity or institutional knowledge.

Auditability and verifiability are enhanced. Access to source code enables independent
security review, more effective incident response, and better alignment between
technical operation and legal accountability.

Open source can reduce governance exposure by limiting dependence on a single
vendorâs roadmap, pricing, or unilateral service changes. This is particularly relevant for
systems that support core public functions.

Interoperability and reuse across borders become more feasible, reducing duplication
of effort and supporting coherent digital public services within the internal market.

Concrete examples include shared identity and access components based on open
standards, document management systems using open formats that ensure long-term
archival access, and security tools where transparency enables faster detection and
remediation of vulnerabilities.

Added value for the private sector

Open-source lowers barriers to entry for European companies, particularly SMEs, by
providing shared building blocks that reduce the cost of developing and deploying
services.

It supports faster innovation by enabling firms to focus on integration, service quality,
and domain-specific value rather than recreating baseline infrastructure.

Open ecosystems encourage competition on trust, reliability, and service quality, rather
than on proprietary lock-in.

Factors for assessing added value

Assessment should consider:

    â¢    Lock-in and switching costs, including data portability, open interfaces, and
         availability of alternative providers.

    â¢    Security and resilience, such as transparency of vulnerability handling,
         dependency management, and patch practices.

    â¢    Operational sustainability, including governance maturity, maintainership depth,
         and funding for ongoing maintenance.

    â¢    Lifecycle cost, including deployment, skills, support, security updates, and long-
         term operation.

    â¢    Innovation and adaptability, particularly the ability to respond to policy change
         without full system replacement.

    â¢    Alignment between responsibility and operational control, ensuring accountable
         bodies retain meaningful authority over systems they operate.

The primary added value is not that open source is inherently cheaper, but that it can
restore conditions under which accountability and oversight remain practical over time.

3. Concrete EU-level measures to support development of the EU
open-source sector and contribute to technological sovereignty
and cybersecurity

Procurement and funding measures

EU-level guidance could encourage consideration of exit capacity, interoperability, and
substitutability alongside cost and delivery in procurement processes. Exit capacity
should be treated as a resilience and legitimacy requirement, not merely as a
contingency measure.

Targeted funding programmes should treat maintenance, security hardening,
documentation, and governance as public-interest infrastructure, particularly for widely
reused components supporting public services.

Procurement templates could encourage or require service providers to contribute
improvements and fixes upstream, reducing fragmentation and long-term maintenance
risk.

Security and assurance measures

EU support could strengthen shared security services for open-source projects,
including coordinated vulnerability handling, triage support, and responsible disclosure
processes.

Rather than introducing heavy certification, common baseline practices could be
promoted for publicly funded open source, such as documented dependency policies,
signed releases, and maintained threat models for critical components. Sustained
maintenance and transparent dependency management are increasingly recognised as
core cybersecurity concerns, not optional enhancements.

Investment in supply-chain transparency tooling would improve visibility and
management of dependencies across public digital systems.

Diogo Vicente Mendes                                                                      5
Interoperability and ecosystem measures

The Strategy could prioritise open standards and funding or supporting the development
of high-quality reference implementations to reduce integration burdens for adopters.

Mechanisms that support reuse across borders should be expanded, enabling
administrations to adopt shared building blocks without duplicating effort.

Federated approaches should be encouraged, allowing shared European baselines to
coexist with national and local implementation layers.

Capacity measures

Support for public sector capability building is essential, including training and
knowledge continuity in open-source operations and security skills.

Measures that strengthen EU-based service providers around open components can
help ensure that adoption does not default to non-EU platforms, reinforcing both
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity objectives.

Diogo Vicente Mendes                                                                 6
4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
Priority should be given to technology areas that underpin multiple public and private
services and where structural dependency creates systemic risk rather than isolated
inefficiency.

In particular:

    â¢    Core digital infrastructure components, including identity and access
         management, data exchange layers, messaging, logging, and orchestration.
         These components are deeply embedded across services, and limited
         substitutability can constrain both operational resilience and policy change.

    â¢    Security-critical software, such as cryptographic libraries, secure
         communications, and monitoring tools. Transparency, maintainability, and
         coordinated vulnerability handling are especially important in these areas.

    â¢    Interoperability layers and reference implementations that enable systems to
         communicate across organisational and national boundaries without imposing a
         single operational stack.

    â¢    Foundational AI-adjacent tooling, such as data processing pipelines, model
         management frameworks, and audit and logging components, where public
         accountability depends on technical visibility rather than black-box integration.

Prioritisation should be guided less by novelty and more by systemic reach:
technologies whose failure, withdrawal, or unilateral change would have
disproportionate impact across administrations or markets.

Diogo Vicente Mendes                                                                         7
5. In what sectors could an increased use of open-source lead to
increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
Increased use of open source can deliver the greatest competitiveness and cyber
resilience benefits in sectors where continuity, interoperability, and trust are critical,
and where dependency risks accumulate over time.

These include:

    â¢    Public administration and digital public services, where open standards and
         open implementations can support long-term maintainability, cross-border
         cooperation, and operational accountability.

    â¢    Healthcare and social services, where interoperability, auditability, and
         resilience are essential, and where vendor lock-in can constrain service
         evolution and data portability.

    â¢    Energy, transport, and other critical infrastructure sectors, where transparency
         and shared security practices contribute directly to resilience and incident
         response.

    â¢    Education and research, where open platforms reduce dependency, support
         skills development, and enable reuse across institutions.

    â¢    SME-driven digital services and industrial supply chains, where open
         foundations lower barriers to entry and allow European firms to compete on
         service quality rather than proprietary control.

Across these sectors, open source contributes to competitiveness not by eliminating
commercial activity, but by enabling multiple providers to operate on shared, trusted
foundations. Cyber resilience is strengthened where maintenance, security practices,
and dependency management are visible and collectively supported rather than
isolated within proprietary systems.

Closing observation

Open source should be understood as part of Europeâs capacity to retain operational
autonomy in critical digital systems. The effectiveness of the Strategy can be assessed
by whether public institutions are able to audit, adapt, and, where necessary, exit
systems without disproportionate disruption, aligning formal compliance with practical
operational control.
