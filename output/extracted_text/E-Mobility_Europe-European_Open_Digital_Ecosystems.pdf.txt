     European Open Digital Ecosystems

E-Mobility Europe represents the voice of the full electric mobility value chain in Eu-
rope, including vehicle manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, software de-
velopers, energy companies, mobility service providers, and research organisations.
Digital technologies and increasingly open-source software and hardware are critical
enablers of the green and digital transition of mobility.
Open source already underpins key layers of connected, electric and software-defined
vehicles, smart charging infrastructure, energy management systems, and mobility ser-
vices. Strengthening the EU open-source ecosystem is therefore essential for Europeâs
industrial competitiveness, technological sovereignty, cybersecurity and climate objec-
tives.

In this context, E-Mobility Europe provides the following responses to the consultation
questions, reflecting the experience and needs of the European electric mobility eco-
system and its reliance on open, interoperable and secure digital technologies.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are
     the main barriers that hamper (i) the adoption and maintenance of high-quality
     and secure open-source solutions, and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-
     source communities?
The European Union benefits from one of the largest and most active open-source
communities worldwide, with strong alignment to EU values such as openness, in-
teroperability, transparency and respect for fundamental rights. Open-source solutions
are already deeply embedded in Europeâs digital economy and are widely used across
sectors such as telecommunications, connectivity, embedded systems, energy sys-
tems, smart cities and industrial applications.
In the e-mobility and electric vehicle ecosystem, open source is increasingly used
across the value chain, including vehicle software, battery and energy management,
charging infrastructure, connectivity, data exchange and integration with energy sys-
tems and public infrastructure. There is increasing evidence across manufacturers, sup-
pliers, infrastructure operators and digital service providers that non-differentiating
software components are best developed collaboratively. This creates clear opportu-
nities to reduce costs, improve interoperability and accelerate innovation at ecosystem
level.

Despite these strengths, the EU faces persistent difficulties in scaling open-source ini-
tiatives into large, globally competitive ecosystems. Europe is strong in developing and
using open source, but often captures only a limited share of the resulting economic
and strategic value. In software-intensive and safety-critical sectors such as electric
mobility, adoption is further slowed by legacy industrial cultures, long product life cy-
cles, high regulatory and liability requirements, and fragmented governance across
transport, energy and digital domains.
The main barriers to adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source
include insufficient long-term funding for maintenance and security updates, limited
integration of open source into certification and approval frameworks, fragmented in-
itiatives without shared reference architectures, and risk-averse procurement prac-
tices in both public and private sectors.

Furthermore, the absence of standardized 'Security by Design' frameworks and feder-
ated identity management creates uncertainty regarding liability. This makes it difficult
for CISOs and procurement officers to validate open-source solutions against emerging
regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), leading to the misconception that they
are less secure than proprietary software.

Sustainable contributions to open-source communities are hampered by an over-reli-
ance on voluntary contributions for critical infrastructure, a lack of mature business
and sustainability models, limited institutional capacity in Europe to steward complex
and long-lived projects, and misalignment between regulatory obligations and open-
source development practices.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
    provide concrete examples, including the most important factors to assess this
    added value (e.g. cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation).
The added value of open source for both public authorities and private actors is well
established and supported by extensive research and market experience. Open source
enables cost efficiency and risk sharing by allowing multiple actors to jointly develop
and maintain non-differentiating software components. It supports interoperability
across systems and providers, reduces dependency on single vendors, and helps avoid
long-term lock-in.
Open source also contributes to improved cybersecurity and resilience through trans-
parency, auditability and shared responsibility for identifying and addressing vulnera-

                                2
bilities. In addition, open-source development often accelerates innovation and stand-
ardisation, as practical implementations can serve as reference points for wider adop-
tion.

Beyond transparency, open source enables verifiable 'Privacy by Design' implementa-
tions. By processing sensitive data at the edge and employing data minimization tech-
niques within open architectures, organizations can drastically reduce their regulatory
risk exposure (GDPR) and prevent mass surveillance, which remains difficult to audit in
'black box' solutions.

In the e-mobility and electric vehicle system, these benefits are particularly evi-
dent. Open-source solutions facilitate interoperability between vehicles, charging in-
frastructure, energy systems and digital services, which is essential for scaling electric
mobility across borders. They also enable closer integration with smart cities, energy
management and sustainability services, creating value that no single actor could de-
liver alone. Key factors to assess this added value include total cost of ownership, se-
curity and resilience, interoperability, innovation capacity and the ability to maintain
long-term control over digital assets.

3. What concrete measures and actions could be taken at EU level to support the
     development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
     technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?
At EU level, greater emphasis should be placed on supporting open-source ecosystems
rather than isolated projects. Funding instruments could more systematically address
the full lifecycle of open-source solutions, including long-term maintenance, security,
governance and integration into real-world deployments. This is particularly important
for software that underpins critical systems such as electric mobility, energy and
transport infrastructure.
The EU could also strengthen trusted, neutral governance structures capable of coor-
dinating collaboration among industry, public authorities and open-source communi-
ties, while ensuring compliance with competition, safety and cybersecurity require-
ments. Such structures are essential for managing shared roadmaps, reference archi-
tectures and long-term sustainability.
Regulatory frameworks should be designed and implemented in close dialogue with
open-source ecosystems. Early and systematic consultation can help ensure that legis-
lation supports, rather than unintentionally hinders, open-source adoption. In soft-
ware-intensive systems, there is scope to move from predominantly process-based

                                3
compliance towards approaches that place greater emphasis on demonstrable out-
comes and system behaviour. This can be achieved while fully maintaining high levels
of safety and security.

To ensure this, the EU should promote the development of 'Compliance as Code' tools
and fund the implementation of Secure Software Development Lifecycles (SSDLC) for
critical projects. This includes the mandatory integration of SBOM (Software Bill of Ma-
terials) generation, cryptographic supply chain signing, and automated security audits,
ensuring the ecosystem is ready for the Cyber Resilience Act by default.

Finally, EU-level coordination could help strengthen capacity at Member State level,
particularly in public procurement, certification and public-sector adoption of open-
source solutions. Greater alignment across Member States would reduce fragmenta-
tion and support the emergence of genuinely European open digital ecosystems.

4. Which technology areas should be prioritised and why?
Priority should be given to technology areas that are software-intensive, safety- and
security-critical, and essential for the functioning of electric mobility systems. These
include software-defined vehicles, battery and energy management systems, charging
infrastructure and interoperability layers, connectivity and data platforms, cloud and
edge computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, including software supply-
chain security.
The electric vehicle system brings together many of these technologies within a single,
highly integrated ecosystem. As such, it represents a strategic opportunity to
strengthen Europeâs digital capabilities, industrial competitiveness and technological
sovereignty, while supporting broader objectives related to sustainability and the
green transition.

5. In which sectors could an increased use of open-source lead to increased com-
     petitiveness and cyber resilience?
Increased use of open source can significantly enhance competitiveness and cyber re-
silience in sectors such as e-mobility and electric vehicles, energy systems and smart
grids, charging and transport infrastructure, smart cities and digital public services, and
industrial manufacturing.
For the European e-mobility ecosystem in particular, collaborative open-source devel-
opment is becoming essential to manage complexity, ensure interoperability and re-
main competitive in a global market. Given current geopolitical dynamics, multiple

                                4
global open-source ecosystems are likely to emerge. Ensuring that Europe plays a lead-
ing role in at least one major ecosystem is therefore critical for long-term resilience,
innovation and technological sovereignty.

For the European e-mobility ecosystem, open source is not a niche choice but a strate-
gic industrial enabler. A coherent EU open-source strategy, combining funding, policy,
procurement, governance and infrastructure, will directly support Europeâs technolog-
ical sovereignty, cybersecurity and industrial competitiveness, while accelerating the
green and digital transition of mobility. Such a strategy can help reduce fragmentation,
enable interoperability across the electric mobility value chain, and support the devel-
opment of trusted and secure digital foundations for vehicles, charging infrastructure,
energy systems and mobility services.
By strengthening European capacity to develop, maintain and govern critical open
technologies, the EU can improve resilience against external dependencies and en-
hance long-term control over key digital assets. Coordinated EU action can also facili-
tate alignment between regulatory frameworks, standardisation efforts and real-world
deployments, ensuring that open-source solutions can be safely and effectively inte-
grated into complex, software-intensive and safety-critical mobility systems.

E-Mobility Europe stands ready to contribute to the implementation of this strategy
and to collaborate with EU institutions, Member States and the broader open-source
community.
