Response to the European Open Digital
Ecosystems Strategy
Open Future welcomes the opportunity to contribute to this call for evidence, and welcomes
the focus of the proposed strategy on open source software and technologies as a way to
bolster digital sovereignty.

Digital sovereigntyâunderstood as the âindependent and self-determined use and design of
digital technologies and systems by the state, private organizations and individualsâ1 âis
not merely a technological aspiration. It is the foundation of the European Unionâs ability to
govern itself, safeguard democracy, foster prosperity, and lead the transition to a
decarbonised economy. Without sufficient control over its digital infrastructure, the EU is
sidelined in critical decisions about its future.

A thriving open source ecosystem is the best path towards building not (just) European
alternatives, but an ecosystem that supports alternative ways of developing technology that
serves the needs of society. This approach goes beyond technical and economic autonomy,
and towards a commitment to foundational values such as the respect for human dignity,
freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and human rights, as set out in Article 2 of the
Treaty on European Union and the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles.

In particular, in line with the recognition in the consultation of the key role played by the
Digital Commons EDIC, the open source ecosystem should be understood not just in terms
of products â openly licensed software code â but as digital commons. The call for evidence
correctly identifies digital commons as shared online resources that are collectively created,
maintained and governed by a community. Many of the open source development efforts
targeted by this initiative also function as a digital commons, with various forms of collective
or community governance.

Digital commons underpin critical layers of the digital stack, and include web server
software, programming libraries and protocols and operating system. Furthermore, open
source software is a foundation for various platforms and infrastructures that function as
digital commons. As an example, Wikipedia is built on open source code, a collectively
managed resource, but also a knowledge platform that plays a key infrastructural role for
various digital ecosystems, including the emergent generative AI ecosystem. Other

examples of digital commons include platforms like Matrix, Decidim, Mastodon, or DHIS2.2
These examples demonstrate that digital commons offer proven frameworks for scaling and
delivering public value.3

By fostering shared ownership and democratic governance, digital commons thus support
digital sovereignty, understood not just as a stateâs ability to act independently, but also as
providing individuals and communities with greater control over the digital environments on
which they rely.

The call for evidence emphasises the importance of a full cycle approach, considering the
need not just to develop software, but to sustain, scale, bring to the market or the public
infrastructures and solutions built on top of this software. This aligns with the framing of
open source technologies as digital commons, which helps shift the focus from
technological artefacts to the social and institutional conditions that sustain them. By
recognising community and stewardship as core infrastructural elements, this approach
provides the necessary foundation for sustaining, scaling, and deploying open technologies
over time.

Digital commons are also particularly suited for cooperation across Member States, as they
address challenges that individual countries or private actors cannot solve alone. By
enabling community-driven innovation and collective governance, digital commons provide
a model for developing public digital infrastructure at scale. They support interoperability
across borders, allow for cost sharing among governments, and enable national adaptation
without sacrificing coordination. Digital commons initiatives also have the capability to
bridge public and private sectors, while aligning with public interest goals.

In this context, we respond below to the specific questions raised by the consultation, with a
particular focus on mechanisms that support open source technologies, and the digital
commons built on their basis.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU
open-source sector? What are the main barriers that
hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and
secure open source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to
open-source communities?

Strengths and Value add of Open Source and Digital Commons
The strategy correctly identifies open source as an important way of building sovereignty,
premised on source code availability, interoperability, and non-lock in. From the perspective
of maintaining the self-determined use of technologies and the autonomy of institutions,
simply switching to European alternatives that still rely on extractive and proprietary
ecosystems that lock users into a relationship of dependence do not address the
fundamental challenge. Further, open source is a more resilient approach to building
meaningfully sovereign alternatives. European technology companies could still be bought
out or acquired by foreign companies, undermining the objectives of the current push
towards strategic autonomy. Open source based technologies in this case offer credible
exit: institutions and businesses can more easily switch to alternative (european) providers
without serious disruption to their activities.

Further, much of the contemporary digital infrastructure is built upon Digital Commons. More
than 70% of modern software depends on open source components. The European
Commission's 2021 study on the economic impact of open source software and hardware
recognized that open source software delivers a 3.5-fold return on investment and
constitutes a form of Digital Commons requiring commons-based governance rather than
purely market-based approaches.

Barriers to Adoption, Maintenance and Sustainability
We identify two main barriers that hamper development, adoption, and sustainability of
open source and digital commons initiatives.

Sustainable Contributions and Funding

While the EU funds digital research and innovation through several programmes, the current
model of support tends to be project-based, with limited support for continuity or scaling.
Such a model does not meet the long-term needs of maintaining digital infrastructures. Such
funding structures tend to incentivize feature development over critical tasks related to
governance and sustainability. This risks leaving maintenance, security, documentation, or

                                            3/11
community building undervalued and underfunded. This gap not only undermines the
growth of individual initiatives but prevents the emergence of sustainable Digital Commons
that can strengthen the EUâs digital sovereignty.

Beyond building technical infrastructure, deploying viable alternatives to dominant platforms
also requires alternative business models and stewardship arrangements. Findings from the
NGI Commons project suggest that Digital Commons rarely follow a single blueprint for
organisational structure or governance. They evolve through processes of collective
experimentation, in which communities iteratively develop governance and operational
arrangements that fit their context and scale. This requires support for experimentation with
alternative models such as cooperative ownership, public utility approaches, or
community-governed infrastructures that can enable open technologies to mature into
viable, sustainable alternatives.

       Support for Critical Infrastructures

Findings from the NGI Commons project indicate that while some digital commons may
generate revenue through provisioning services, many foundational infrastructures may be
unable to create viable income streams due to their open and shared nature. These
infrastructures require direct, sustained public funding. As noted, open source and digital
commons underlie much of the contemporary digital infrastructure, with up to 70% of
modern software depending on open source components.

While many such open source projects benefit from private contributions or commercial
ecosystems, numerous othersâespecially small but widely used componentsâoperate
under severe resource constraints. A 2024 survey found that 60% of European open source
maintainers are unpaid, and most are sole maintainers of their projects. The consequences
can sometimes manifest in the form of security vulnerabilities and governance deficits.

As with any critical infrastructure, the digital systems underpinning social and economic life
require predictable, long-term funding throughout their entire lifecycle. Public investment,
best suited to supporting infrastructures that do not fully align with market logic, should
enable the development, maintenance, and democratic governance of such shared digital
resources, over their entire lifecycle, recognizing that digital commons can provide
foundational infrastructure.

Adoption Challenges

The EU, through programmes such as NGI, already funds promising open source
technologies with the potential for public value. However, these technologies also need
demand side impetus to scale. Competing against dominant players with significant network
effects and lock-in, as well as large amounts of capital, requires sustained and strategic

                                              4/11
procurement support. Public funding can help EU-based and open source providers scale
and become more competitive, and more attractive avenues for further private investment.

Unfortunately, current procurement practices favour established, non-EU technology
providers and proprietary solutions, reinforcing vendor lock-in and limiting opportunities for
European open source alternatives. By prioritizing short-term cost savings over long-term
strategic objectives, including interoperability and autonomy, these practices de facto
subsidize foreign technology with public funds.

In the absence of a clear framework preferencing open source, as well as support and
guidance on implementation, contracting authorities default to proprietary technologies and
platforms. This perpetuates a dynamic where public bodies become further entrenched in
proprietary ecosystems, public funds are not used strategically, and local or open-source
solutions fail to receive support beyond pilot stages.

Frameworks for procuring open solutions are also not tailored to the dynamics of open
source development and address the sustainability of the ecosystem. For instance, in the
context of open source software, public entities typically may not procure the software itself,
which is already available under an open licence, but rather services related to support,
operation, customisation, or further development.

Overly narrow procurement criteria, such as an exclusive focus on price, can create
incentives for practices such as underpricing tenders without allocating sufficient resources
to in-house development or maintenance, excessive reliance on unpaid community
contributions, or failing to contribute modifications back to the shared codebase. This
results in value extraction from open source ecosystems and their contributing communities,
rather than reciprocal and sustainable participation. It also places providers that invest in the
long-term sustainability of open source ecosystems at a competitive disadvantage.
Procurement frameworks should therefore include conditionalities that reward sustainable
contribution practices and ensure that publicly funded improvements are made available
upstream.

and private sectors? Please provide concrete examples,
including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security,
innovation, among others) that are most important to
assess the added value.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at
EU level to support the development and growth of the EU
open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?
Reforming Funding Frameworks
We support the key objective identified in the call, of continuing development and ensuring
appropriate visibility of EU high-quality and secure open-source solutions and
demonstrating their added value. To address issues of âdeployment, usability, software
supply chain security and governance, maintenance of code and project sustainability to
ensure take-up and upscalingâ, the EUâs approach to funding research and innovation
requires reorientation, in alignment with the lifecycle of open source technologies and digital
commons.
This reorientation requires an integrated approach to funding: one that supports early
experimentation; but also values maintenance and governance on par with technical
innovation; and that provides medium- and long-term funding for scaling and stewardship of
digital commons that underlie essential infrastructures.

The NGI programmeâs cascade funding model is well adapted to the decentralised nature of
open source communities, enabling a wide ecosystem of innovation and experimentation
while maintaining alignment with EU priorities. The NGI model, which disburses funding
through intermediaries embedded in the ecosystem, allows these organisations to leverage
their understanding of community-driven development and domain-specific expertise. They
can offer deeper support to applicants and grantees by providing guidance and mentorship,
constructive feedback, and access to relevant networks.

The impact of this model would be significantly strengthened if its principles were
embedded in design choices across the EUâs wider funding architecture. This includes, for
instance, eligibility requirements preferencing openness and interoperability, evaluation
criteria that value governance and community sustainability, and funding instruments that
support long-term stewardship rather than short-term delivery.

Strategic Funding for Scale and Competitiveness

In addition to support for experimentation and early-stage development, public funding
should enable scaling and maturation of Digital Commons and public digital infrastructures
that have the potential to become viable alternatives to dominant, extractive platform
models. The focus should be on targeted and strategic support that allows commons-based
initiatives in transitional phases to develop sustainable organisational and economic models.

                                             6/11
Commons-based alternatives must compete with incumbent platforms that benefit from
entrenched network effects, access to capital, and closed ecosystems that externalise costs
onto users and institutions. In this context, strategic public funding can play a
market-shaping role by supporting scaling pathways that prioritise openness,
interoperability, and public value, rather than extractive growth strategies.

This requires funding mechanisms that go beyond short-term project grants and include
time-bound operational support, and blended financial instruments that enable
organisations to professionalise operations and invest in maintenance and reliability.

This calls for staged or tiered funding pathways that allow successful initiatives to graduate
to larger, multi-year support, based on rewarding maturity and governance capacity. By
enabling promising Digital Commons to transition from prototypes into robust, competitive
infrastructures, such mechanisms reduce dependency on closed and proprietary
ecosystems while fostering genuinely competitive alternatives aligned with public-interest
objectives.

Support for Critical Infrastructures
We support proposals for an EU-level instrument, such as an EU Sovereign Tech Fund
(EU-STF), to address critical dependencies in the EUâs digital infrastructure, particularly by
supporting strategically important open source components.

Such an instrument should focus on five core activities:

   ââ Systematically map open source dependencies across critical infrastructure to
      identify under-maintained, vulnerable, or strategically important components.
   ââ Procure and support maintainers to carry out essential upkeep of strategically
      relevant open source projects.
   ââ Fund security audits and expert-led interventions, delivered through trusted
      intermediaries, to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of critical open source
      components.
   ââ Provide dedicated funding to enable widely used projects to improve, evolve, and
      scale in line with strategic priorities.
   ââ Support coordination, capacity-building, collaboration, and training across the open
      source ecosystem to reinforce long-term sustainability.

In addition to a focus on critical technical components, the scope of such an instrument
should encompass the governance and community structures required to sustain Digital
Commons over time. Addressing technical dependencies without investing in the social and
organisational foundations that maintain these infrastructures risks reproducing fragility,
rather than achieving meaningful and durable technological sovereignty.

                                            7/11
Critical open source infrastructure also underpins a resilient and pluralistic digital public
space, including decentralized and interoperable communication platforms that support
independence from proprietary, surveillance-driven platforms. Dependence on such
platforms creates strategic vulnerabilities and threatens the integrity of public discourse. The
scope of an instrument for critical open source infrastructure should squarely include
support for decentralized alternatives to closed social media platforms.

Public Procurement Support
Public procurement can be a substantial strategic lever for digital sovereignty and support
for digital commons. Through strategic procurement, public bodies can channel investment
into open-source technologies, while also shaping markets in line with public values. The
Digital Decade programme puts in place a target of moving all key public services online by
2030. Without a coordinated digital sovereignty strategy, procurement practices can
consolidate the dominance of proprietary Big Tech providers, instead of strengthening the
digital commons and European industry.

Public procurement reform can be central to the objective of promoting best practice and
encouraging the public sector, specialised business sectors and large customers to
contribute to and adopt open source. Adoption by the public sector can facilitate further
demand from the private sector, along with being a powerful market shaping strategy to
ensure that public funds maximise public value, through conditionalities.

Strategically leveraging public procurement, can also address gaps in research and
innovation funding, which often prioritizes early pilots over long-term sustainability and
integration into infrastructure. Pre-commercial procurement provides a tool to steer research
and innovation toward commercially viable solutions aligned with public needs and already
on a pathway to adoption.

The public procurement framework should embed openness, interoperability, and
non-locking as guiding principles. This approach is central to a more assertive industrial
policy that reframes procurement from simply a purchasing exercise into a strategic
market-building effort.

To advance this objective, procurement reform should prioritize: favor open-source solutions
and avoid proprietary requirements that exclude open alternatives; mandate interoperability
and exit rights, requiring that purchased systems can work together and integrate with other
providers' services, preventing long-term dependency; demonstrable switching capability:
for complex IT services, providers must demonstrate during the bidding process that they
can actually transfer systems to competitors.

Frameworks for procuring open solutions must also be tailored to the dynamics of open
source development and address the sustainability of the ecosystem. Overly narrow

                                             8/11
procurement criteria, such as an exclusive focus on price, can create incentives for practices
such as underpricing tenders without allocating sufficient resources to in-house
development or maintenance, excessive reliance on unpaid community contributions, or
failing to contribute modifications back to the shared codebase. This places providers that
invest in the long-term sustainability of open source ecosystems at a competitive
disadvantage. Procurement frameworks should therefore include conditionalities that reward
sustainable contribution practices and ensure that publicly funded improvements are made
available upstream.

Implementing a framework that encourages (sustainable) open source procurement also
requires providing additional guidance and support to contracting authorities, along with
modifications to procurement rules to meaningfully prioritize open-source providers.

Conditionalities related to cloud sovereignty and ecosystem sustainability need not operate
as eligibility criteria for participation in tenders, but may instead be structured as contractual
obligations to be fulfilled during execution. This limits excessive barriers to participation in
tender processes, especially for SMEs, while enabling public bodies to iteratively shape
markets and create incentives in the direction of strategic outcomes.

The Digital Commons EDIC as a Coordination Vehicle
The Strategy already recognises the synergy with the Digital Commons EDIC. The EDIC can
play a role in meeting the objective of âsupporting market integration, especially with legacy
systems and policy alignment.â

While EU funding has launched many innovative digital projects, the absence of a stable,
long-term institutional home for governance and stewardship means that many promising
initiatives fail to achieve lasting impact or scalability. Alongside sustained investment in
research and innovation, Digital Commons in particular depend on durable governance
frameworks to ensure their continued development and uptake. Without such frameworks,
the impact of public investment risks remaining fragmented and failing to translate into
sustainable deployment.

The Digital Commons EDIC provides the legal and operational framework for Member States
to jointly develop, govern, and sustain digital infrastructure, enabling long-term policy
alignment and shared cost management.

The Digital Commons EDIC could act as an institutional anchor by: hosting critical projects
and coordinating multi-country initiatives; managing funding flows to ensure continuity from
research to deployment; maintaining shared digital tools and infrastructure for the public
good; providing one-stop ecosystem support to both suppliers and users of open source
technologies.

                                              9/11
For the Digital Commons EDIC to effectively fulfil this role, it must be backed by adequate,
predictable, and sustainable resources.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why? 5.
In what sectors could an increased use of open source
lead to increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
As noted, open source technologies and Digital Commons that underpin critical digital
infrastructures should receive priority. These components represent the greatest vectors of
risk from a sovereignty and cybersecurity perspective if left without sustained support.

In addition, the deployment of open source and Digital Commons solutions in the public
sector should be prioritised, as the dependence of public institutions on proprietary
ecosystems poses a clear threat to their autonomy and ability to perform public functions.
Change in the public sector can also have catalytic effects, channeling demand and
investment from the private sector towards open technologies, ensuring sustainability of
open source ecosystems, and contributing to broader shifts in market behaviour.

Open and interoperable communication platforms are central to digital sovereignty. Digital
communication platforms that shape public discourse in Europe are currently concentrated
among a small number of dominant corporations whose advertising-driven business models
prioritise engagement over democratic values. These platforms amplify disinformation,
contribute to declining institutional trust, and weaken societal cohesion, posing significant
challenges to democratic discourse.

While regulatory instruments such as the Digital Services Act address platform
accountability, they do not create the structural alternatives needed for genuinely
democratic digital public spaces. There is therefore a need to recognise sovereign digital
communication spaces as critical public digital infrastructure and to invest in open, publicly
governed, interoperable, and decentralised alternatives to prevent corporate or state
capture.

In addition the EU should support a holistic public AI approach that combines measures
related to the provision of compute, data, and AI models. Public AI represents a vision of
open source AI development that prioritises the public interest and operates under public
control or ownership. The AI Continent Action Plan (including Apply AI and Data Union
strategies) includes actions that contribute to such a strategy for Europe. However, a key
element remains missing: robust and sustained support for the development of
state-of-the-art European open-source AI models. This gap can be explicitly addressed and
foregrounded through the Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy.

                                            10/11
Strategically prioritising open source and interoperable technologies also has important
implications for the cloud sector. Even with greater adoption of open source software, cloud
infrastructure remains the foundational layer upon which other elements of public digital
infrastructure, from government services to communication platforms, are built. At present,
this critical layer is largely controlled by non-EU providers.

Public procurement reform can create an enabling environment for directing investment to
âsovereignâ cloud providers, by leveraging procurement at the software and platform layers
to strategically channel demand towards providers meeting defined criteria related to the
infrastructural layers. This can shift the cloud market towards service unbundling, mandatory
interoperability and data portability and guaranteed migration capabilities, and transparent
pricing. This aligns with the recognition in the call for evidence that there are synergies with
this strategy and the upcoming cloud and AI development act.
