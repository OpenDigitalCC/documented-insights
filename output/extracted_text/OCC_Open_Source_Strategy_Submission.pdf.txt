    Open-by-Design:
 Enabling multi-cloud for
European competitiveness

                         February 2026
The Open Cloud Coalition (OCC) â an alliance of cloud providers and users â welcomes the
European Commission's call for evidence on the European Open Digital Ecosystem
Strategy. We agree that open-source solutions are key to improving Europeâs
competitiveness. Openness in software environments and markets more broadly will be a
critical prerequisite for ensuring Europe can compete globally, enabling genuine
technological sovereignty.

The OCC supports a European cloud market that is fair, competitive, and resilient,
creating skilled jobs and boosting our digital economy. European governments and
businesses currently rely on two dominant cloud providers, which deploy anti-
competitive practices such as restrictive licensing, technical lock-in, forced bundling, and
cloud credits. These practices create dependency and supply chain risk by making it
prohibitively expensive for organisations to meaningfully choose among innovative cloud
alternatives, including from Europe. This concentrates the market and the attack surface
for malicious actors.

Recent cloud outages have shown the risks of relying on just a few providers: in late 2025,
failures in three global platforms disrupted large parts of the Internet. Open software
environments that support multi-cloud use reduce dependency and increase resilience.
Multi-cloud strategies put users in the driving seat, allowing them to pick and combine
solutions based on quality, security, and performance, not the providerâs origin. This
spreads workloads across multiple providers, including EU-based alternatives, ensuring a
breach or outage in one system doesnât simultaneously expose all sensitive assets or
cause cascading failures across sectors.

To build a truly sovereign and secure digital ecosystem, Europe needs widespread use of
open, interoperable, multi-cloud solutions that reduce systemic risks. Resilience requires
genuine competition, where European cloud alternatives succeed by competing on merit
in open, global markets, not by regulatory protection that dampens innovation,
undermining the competitiveness that would make the European cloud market more
resilient and sovereign.
Policy recommendations

  Public procurement:
     Mandate cloud-neutral and technology-agnostic procurement frameworks across
     all EU institutions and member states
     Implement transparent whole-life cost assessments that reveal true costs of
     vendor lock-in
     Subject all cloud purchasing to fair and accountable decision-making with
     published evaluation criteria
     Require procurement decisions to be based on outcomes, performance, and
     security requirements rather than provider origin
     Establish procurement guidelines that actively promote multi-cloud strategies for
     critical systems

  Interoperability and portability:
     Establish technical standards for configuration portability enabling workloads to
     move between providers
     Mandate comprehensive data portability between cloud providers through
     technical standards
     Create unbundled pricing disclosure requirements allowing accurate cost
     comparisons across providers
     Develop open standards for API compatibility reducing switching costs

  Support European cloud alternatives through enabling conditions that create a level
  playing field rather than picking winners:
     Invest in technical infrastructure supporting interoperability standards that
     European providers can leverage
     Fund development of open-source tools reducing barriers to entry for new
     European cloud providers
     Support sector-specific data spaces operating independently of specific cloud
     vendors
     Provide resources for European SMEs to achieve certifications and compete in
     public procurement
     Create innovation programs connecting European cloud startups with enterprise
     customers
