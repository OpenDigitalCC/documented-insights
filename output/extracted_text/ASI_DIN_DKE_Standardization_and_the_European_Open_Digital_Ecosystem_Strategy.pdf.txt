Strengthening Europeâs Open
Source Ecosystem through
Standardization
A Standardization Perspective on better
Regulation, Interoperability and Digital
Sovereignty

                                                     1
â   Executive Summary
European standardization forms the backbone of Europeâs digital infrastructure,
providing trusted frameworks that ensure interoperability, legal certainty, market
access, and scalability. Standards are essential for maintaining a coherent,
reliable, and efficient technological ecosystem across Europe.
Open Source Software (OSS/FLOSS) can serve as a powerful complement to this
system by enhancing innovation capacity, supporting practical implementation,
and contributing to Europeâs technological sovereignty. When aligned with
European standardization, Open Source can help translate normative
requirements into interoperable, secure, and reusable solutions that are easier to
adopt in practice.
From a standardization perspective, the current separation between
standardization and Open Source represents a missed opportunity. Better
integration can significantly improve regulatory effectiveness, implementation
quality, cybersecurity, and industrial uptake, while also strengthening the
sustainability of Open Source communities themselves. At the same time, many
Open Source maintainers currently lack clear incentives, pathways, and
recognition to engage in formal standardization processes, despite pursuing
closely aligned technical objectives.
This paper argues for a systematic coupling of European standardization and
Open Source through:
    â¢   Integrating Open Source communities into European standardization
        processes in a structured and sustainable way.
    â¢   Complementing stable standards with Open Source reference
        implementations to support adoption and trust in regulated markets.
    â¢   Establishing EU-level funding mechanisms to sustain standardization-
        related Open Source activities, including long-term maintenance and
        security.
Such an approach directly supports EU priorities such as Better Regulation, the
Digital Product Passport (DPP), the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and Europeâs
broader digital sovereignty agenda.

                                                                                     2
1.       What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU Open Source sector?
         What are the main barriers?
Strengths
     â¢   Europe benefits from a strong research and innovation landscape, with
         significant contributions from academia, publicly funded research
         programmes, public administrations, and a dynamic SME ecosystem that
         actively develops and uses Open Source solutions.
     â¢   Open Source Software already plays a central role in many critical digital
         infrastructures, including cloud platforms, data spaces, cybersecurity
         solutions, AI frameworks, and embedded systems, making it a de facto
         foundation of Europeâs digital economy.
     â¢   At policy level, there is increasing recognition of Open Source as a strategic
         asset for technological sovereignty, resilience, and reduced dependency on
         single vendors, as reflected in recent EU strategies and legislative
         initiatives.
Weaknesses
     â¢   Open Source implementations are often developed in a fragmented manner
         across sectors, projects, and Member States, resulting in duplication of
         effort and limited interoperability.
     â¢   Many Open Source projects lack sustainable funding models, clear
         maintenance responsibilities, and long-term stewardship, which can affect
         quality, security, and continuity.
     â¢   There is insufficient alignment between Open Source projects, regulatory
         requirements, and harmonised European standards.
     â¢   Public procurement and regulated markets often lack trusted reference
         points, such as recognised or certified implementations, making it difficult
         to rely on Open Source solutions in compliance-critical environments.
Barriers
     â¢   There is currently no EU-wide programme dedicated to the long-term
         maintenance, security auditing, and lifecycle management of strategically
         relevant Open Source components.
     â¢   Incentives for industry and public administrations to contribute upstream
         to Open Source projects remain weak, even though such contributions are
         essential for sustainability and security.
     â¢   Mature governance models for Open Source projects that are formally
         recognised at EU level are largely missing, which limits trust, adoption, and
         systematic integration into regulatory and standardization frameworks.

                                                                                      3
Standardization Perspective:
Standardized interfaces, data models, and conformity frameworks for Open
Source projects can significantly enhance their integration into regulated
environments. The structural challenges need to be addressed. The alignment
of Open Source initiatives with standardized practices holds the potential to
drive growth and facilitate cooperation across diverse industries.

2.       What is the added value of open source for the public and private
         sectors? Please provide concrete examples, including the factors (such
         as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation, among others) that are most
         important to assess the added value.
Public Sector Benefits:
     â¢      Lower costs and reduced vendor lockâin: Interoperable, modifiable
            solutions reduce longâterm dependency.
     â¢      Transparency and auditability: Essential for DPP, eGovernment, identity
            systems and CRA compliance.
     â¢      Rapid implementation of legal requirements: OSS reference
            implementations can validate regulatory feasibility (âBetter Regulation
            through Codeâ).
Private Sector Benefits:
     â¢      Accelerated innovation: OSS shortens development cycles and enables
            shared R&D.
     â¢      Improved interoperability: Standardized OSS APIs, formats and
            protocols reduce integration burdens.
     â¢      Lower compliance costs: OSS reference implementations enable early
            validation of the applicability of standards and upcoming regulatory
            obligations.
     â¢      Security improvements: Community review and rapid patch cycles
            strengthen supplyâchain resilience.

                                                                                   4
Role of Standardization:
Standards amplify this value by:
â¢    providing stable, technology-neutral specifications,
â¢    enabling interoperability between multiple Open Source and proprietary
     implementations,
â¢    creating legal and procedural certainty for adoption at scale,
â¢    adding another layer of trust.

3.       What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to
         support the development and growth of the EU Open Source sector and
         contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and cybersecurity
         agenda?
From a standardization perspective, the following actions are recommended:
a. Systematic integration of Open Source into European standardization
processes
     â¢     Early involvement of Open Source communities and foundations in
           standardization committees, while fully respecting the principles of
           national delegation.
     â¢     Refined participation and contribution requirements for liaison partners,
           enabling project-based engagement of Open Source initiatives.
b. Reference implementations linked to Standards
     â¢     Use of Open Source reference implementations developed alongside
           stable standards and specifications as practical implementation
           guidance, validation tools, and technical baselines for testing and
           conformity.
     â¢     By translating normative requirements into executable artefacts,
           reference implementations can lower implementation barriers, reduce
           misinterpretation, and support the broader adoption of harmonised
           standards.
c. Funding
     â¢     Align Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, IPCEI, and national funding with
           standardization-linked Open Source activities.
     â¢     Longâterm funding for critical OSS components, explicitly supporting
           activities that connect Open Source development with standardization
           processes and outcomes.

                                                                                    5
4.       What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
Based on regulatory pressure, market relevance, and societal impact, priority
areas include:
     â¢   Digital Product Passport (DPP) & Circular Economy
     â¢   Cybersecurity & software supply chain security
     â¢   Data spaces and interoperability frameworks
     â¢   Cloud-to-edge infrastructures
     â¢   AI and trustworthy AI toolchains
     â¢   Quantum technologies
These domains require compatible implementations, cross-border
interoperability, and trusted governance, which cannot be achieved by regulation
or Open Source alone.

5.       In what sectors could an increased use of Open Source lead to
         increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
Increased and coordinated use of Open Source and standards can significantly
boost competitiveness and cyber resilience in:
     â¢   Cybersecurity
     â¢   Public administration and eGovernment
     â¢   Manufacturing, Industrial Automation and supply chains
     â¢   Mobility, Energy & Critical Infrastructure
     â¢   Healthcare
     â¢   Emerging deep-tech sectors (AI, quantum, advanced materials)

6.       Towards a New Model: Standards Ã Open Source
This paper proposes a shift from a document-centric view of standardization
towards a âstandards + implementationâ model, where:
     â¢   Standards define what is required,
     â¢   Open Source reference implementations demonstrate how it can be
         implemented,
     â¢   and governance ensures trust, neutrality, and sustainability.
Such a model strengthens both ecosystems:
     â¢   Open Source gains legitimacy, adoption, and regulatory compatibility.
     â¢   Standardization gains relevance, implementability, and real-world impact.

                                                                                     6
7.       Conclusion
European standardization is a cornerstone of Europeâs digital single market,
providing trusted, inclusive, and stable frameworks for interoperability, legal
certainty, market access, and scalability. In an increasingly software-driven and
regulated environment, ensuring that standards remain implementable, secure,
and widely adopted is essential for Europeâs competitiveness and digital
sovereignty.
Open Source Software is not a competing system, but a natural and powerful
complement to standardization. When properly aligned, Open Source enables
standards to be translated into practical, interoperable, and reusable
implementations, supporting regulatory effectiveness, industrial uptake, and
cybersecurity. The continued separation of both ecosystems limits their collective
impact and weakens Europeâs ability to turn regulation into innovation.
From a standardization perspective, deeper engagement with Open Source
ecosystems is therefore not a departure from established principles, but a
necessary evolution. It requires targeted adjustments to participation models,
governance frameworks, and licensing approaches in order to accommodate
Open Source contribution practices while safeguarding the neutrality, legitimacy,
and trust embedded in European standardization.
To realise this potential, Europe should pursue a coherent âStandards Ã Open
Sourceâ approach, focused on the following key actions:
     â¢   Systematically integrate Open Source communities and foundations into
         European standardization processes.
     â¢   Establish Open Source reference implementations linked to stable
         standards, serving as implementation guidance, validation instruments, and
         trusted reference points for regulated markets and public procurement.
     â¢   Create EU-level funding mechanisms that jointly support standardization-
         related Open Source activities, including long-term maintenance, security
         audits, and lifecycle management of critical components.
     â¢   Develop recognised governance models that connect policy objectives,
         standards development, and Open Source implementation, enabling trust,
         scalability, and cross-border interoperability.
By pursuing these measures, Europe can strengthen both standardization and
Open Source, ensuring that standards remain implementable, Open Source gains
legitimacy and sustainability, and regulatory objectives translate more effectively
into secure, interoperable, and competitive digital solutions. DIN, DKE, and ASI
stand ready to contribute normative expertise, coordination capacity, and
practical implementation pathways to support this transformation in close
alignment with European policy priorities.
