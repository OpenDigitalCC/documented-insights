Response from CNLL to the âEuropean
Open Digital Ecosystemsâ Consultation

Respondent: Conseil National du Logiciel Libre (CNLL)
Subject: Contribution to the European Commissionâs upcoming Open Source Strategy

Introduction
For over 15 years, the Conseil National du Logiciel Libre (CNLL) has served as the representative body
for the French Open Source professional ecosystem, speaking on behalf of over 300 innovative SMEs and
mid-caps that drive employment, local value creation, and digital independence in France. We view Open
Source Software (OSS) not merely as a technical methodology, but as the strategic imperative for
Europeâs digital sovereignty and industrial competitiveness.
Our position, fully aligned with our European partners at APELL, is that the era of âlaissez-faireâ in digital
policy is over. While the immediate political mandate for action stems from vulnerabilities to
extraterritorial laws and supply chain shocks, the root causes are systemic. Europe faces a critical choice:
continue to suffer from deep technological dependency and structural economic imbalancesâwhere value
is extracted by non-EU hyperscalers rather than reinvested locallyâor become an active producer and
steward of its own digital infrastructure.
To address these systemic failures, the Commission must transition to a robust industrial policy that
moves beyond soft encouragement to active market shaping. As detailed in this response, this strategy
rests on three fundamental pillars:
1. A âRisk-Basedâ Technological Doctrine: Europe must replace naive openness with a rigorous
   Sovereignty Risk Assessment Framework. Technology adoption must be conditional on legal
   immunity from extraterritorial jurisdictions, supply chain security, and enforceable interoperability,
   distinguishing between safe digital public goods and captured ecosystems.
2. A Transformed Public Procurement Strategy: We advocate for a binding âOpen Source Firstâ
   principle combined with a strict âEuropean Preferenceâ for service providers, and additional
   measures (promotion, trainingâ¦) to ensure that this preference is actually enacted. This must include
   specific mechanisms (like Allotment) to ensure public funding reaches the creators of the software
   (Open Source software vendors / Ã©diteurs de logiciels libres) rather than being captured solely by
   integrators, thereby fixing the broken value chain.
3. Structural Funding for the Digital Public Goods: We must operationalize this strategy by
   leveraging existing assets (Horizon/Digital Europe) while deploying necessary new capabilities:
   specifically, the establishment of an EU Sovereign Tech Fund to secure the maintenance of critical
   infrastructure (ODBTs) and the mobilization of the DC-EDIC as a technical assistance facility to de-risk
   adoption.
By aligning its regulatory power (procurement) with its investment capacity (funding), Europe can secure
its digital future.
A. Current state of the EU open-source sector
1. Strengths and Weaknesses of the EU Open-Source Sector
Strengths: A Sovereign, High-Value Industrial Base
The European open-source ecosystem is characterized by a unique level of industrial maturity in âdeep
techâ sectors. Unlike the consumer-centric software models often seen elsewhere, European SMEs and
mid-caps have established themselves as global leaders in critical infrastructure layers such as Embedded
Systems, Industrial IoT, Edge Computing, and Cloud Infrastructure. As detailed in the Cloud-Edge Alliance
Roadmap, European open-source frameworks are already the operational backbone of Industry 4.0, smart
cities, and public utilities across the continent.
Furthermore, the European sector offers a unique âsovereignty value propositionâ that non-European
competitors cannot match. European open-source software (OSS) naturally aligns with the regulatory
requirements of the GDPR and the Data Act by offering full code auditability and options for strict data
residency. This capability provides public and private entities with what we call a âsovereignty premiumâ:
the ability to guarantee legal immunity from extraterritorial jurisdictions (such as the US CLOUD Act or
FISA). This is a competitive advantage that is intrinsic to the European model and critical for strategic
autonomy.
Finally, the sector acts as a powerful economic multiplier. Investment in open source generates high
returns that remain largely anchored within the EU economy. Unlike the license revenues of non-EU
proprietary giants which often flow offshore, the economic value of OSS is captured through high-skilled
jobs in R&D, consulting, and integrationâjobs that are rooted in local territories and cannot be easily
outsourced.

Weaknesses: Asymmetric Value Extraction
Despite these strengths, the European open-source ecosystem faces a critical imbalance in value
distribution. While it is home to technically advanced SMEs and micro-enterprises, these actors often lack
the financial resources to compete with non-EU tech giants. The problem is not their capability but a
âStrategic Blindnessâ among European National Champions. Large European integrators and
industrial groups (in sectors like Telco, Defense, and Aerospace) frequently bypass the local ecosystem.
Instead of contracting directly with the European SMEs that create and maintain the software, they often
prefer to source âEnterpriseâ distributions or cloud services from US vendors or integrate the Open Source
components themselves without contributing financially to the original creators.
This behavior creates a severe economic imbalance. If European industrial leaders sourced their
open-source needs directly from local creators (Vendors/Ãditeurs), the ecosystem would be self-
sustaining. Instead, the current purchasing behavior of Europeâs own champions effectively subsidizes
foreign competitors or starves the local R&D base, weakening the very economic fabric they rely on for
sovereignty.

2. Main Barriers to Adoption and Maintenance of High-Quality Open
Source
The barriers preventing the wider adoption of open source are rarely related to the quality of the software
itself. Instead, they are primarily the result of cultural inertia and flawed procurement methodologies.

The âDefensive Buyingâ Syndrome and Risk Aversion
Public procurement is heavily influenced by a culture of risk aversion. Public buyers often default to large,
non-EU proprietary vendors not because they offer superior technology, but due to a perceived sense of
safety and habitâthe ânobody gets fired for buying the incumbentâ syndrome. There are currently
insufficient incentives for public procurers to take the perceived âriskâ of choosing sovereign, open
European solutions, despite the long-term strategic benefits.

Flawed Economic Metrics in Procurement
Tenders are frequently structured around metrics that disadvantage open source. Procurement processes
typically focus heavily on the initial license priceâwhich is often zero for OSSâwhile ignoring the Total
Cost of Ownership (TCO) over the projectâs lifecycle. Crucially, they fail to account for exit costs.
Proprietary solutions often hide massive, unpredictable costs required to migrate away or retrieve data,
whereas OSS offers near-zero exit costs and greater long-term flexibility. By ignoring the cost of âlock-in,â
public tenders skew the market in favor of proprietary vendors.
âOpen Washingâ and Lack of Enforceable Standards The marketplace is confused by âopen washing,â
where vendors claim openness while retaining control over standards and interoperability. Without strict,
enforceable open standards that mandate genuine data portability and API neutrality, the theoretical
benefits of OSS adoptionâsuch as market fluidity and the ability to switch providersâcannot be realized in
practice.

3. Main Barriers to Sustainable Contributions: The Intermediary Value
Trap
The most critical threat to the sustainability of the European open-source ecosystem is economic. It stems
from a broken value chain where the funding provided by public and private consumers does not reach the
producers of the technology.

The âIntegrator vs. Creatorâ Disconnect
The central structural failure in the public sector is that administrations rarely contract directly with the
companies that actually produce and maintain open-source software (the Creators or Ãditeurs). Instead,
public procurement is dominated by massive framework contracts that favor large Systems Integrators and
generalist IT consultancies.
When a public administration deploys an open-source solution, they pay significant sums to these
Integrators for deployment, customization, and support. However, these Integrators capture the vast
majority of this value. They rarely pass a fair share of the revenue back to the SME Publisher that writes,
secures, and maintains the core software product.
This creates a parasitic dynamic: the public sector âconsumesâ the innovation and stability provided by the
Publisher but pays the Integrator. This starves the creators of the software of the recurring revenue needed
for R&D, security hardening, and maintenance. It weakens the very supply chain the public sector relies
on, turning European OSS Publishers into fragile entities despite the widespread use of their products.

Regulatory Chill and Liability Risks
European SMEs face increasing anxiety regarding legal liability. Well-intentioned regulations, such as
initial drafts of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), create a climate of uncertainty where smaller players fear
that publishing open code could expose them to disproportionate financial penalties if a vulnerability is
discovered. This âregulatory chillâ discourages the release of innovation, hampers the collaborative model
that defines open source, and even prevents European Open Source technologies to be sold on the
European market.

The Dual Tragedy of the Commons
Finally, the ecosystem suffers from a âdual tragedy of the commons.â On one side, there is under-provision:
a chronic lack of resources for the maintenance of critical infrastructure due to the value trap described
above. On the other side, there is over-exploitation: an ever-increasing demand from users and
corporations who integrate free code into commercial products without reinvesting in the upstream
communities. This imbalance leads to security vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure where essential
components rely on under-funded, over-stretched individuals and teams.

B. Added value of Open Source Software (OSS) for the
European public and private sectors
Our core position is that the added value of open source has shifted. While historically valued primarily for
cost reduction (no license fees), its primary value today lies in strategic risk management: specifically,
the mitigation of geopolitical risk, vendor lock-in risk, and supply chain security risk.

1. Digital Sovereignty and Legal Immunity
The most critical added value for the public sector today is the assurance of digital sovereignty and
legal immunity. As detailed in the Cloud-Edge Roadmap, reliance on non-EU proprietary technology
providers exposes European data to extraterritorial jurisdiction, such as the US CLOUD Act or FISA 702.
Proprietary software acts as a âblack boxâ where the user cannot verify if data is being exfiltrated or if
âbackdoorsâ exist.
Open source provides a unique remediation to this risk through full auditability. Because the code is
transparent, European administrations can independently verify security claims and host the software on
sovereign infrastructure (e.g., SecNumCloud in France) without dependency on the original vendorâs cloud.
This creates a âsovereignty premiumâ: the ability for an organization to guarantee that its digital
infrastructure is subject only to European law. This is not merely a technical feature but a prerequisite for
the autonomy of European institutions and the protection of industrial secrets.

2. Mitigation of Vendor Lock-in and Exit Costs
For both public and private sectors, the most economically significant factor is the reduction of vendor
lock-in and the associated exit costs. In proprietary models, the cost of migrating away from a vendor
(the exit cost) is often prohibitively high due to proprietary data formats, obscure APIs, and licensing traps.
This effectively eliminates market competition once a vendor is selected.
Open source radically alters this economic dynamic. By adhering to open standards and allowing access to
the source code, OSS enables interoperability and portability. An administration using an open-source
solution (e.g., for document management or cloud infrastructure) retains the freedom to switch service
providersâmoving from a global integrator to a local SME, or bringing the service in-houseâwithout
losing data or having to rebuild the software stack. This restores the buyerâs negotiating power and fosters
a competitive service market, as opposed to a rent-seeking license market.

3. Security through Transparency and Supply Chain Resilience
The added value regarding security stems from the principle that transparency outperforms obscurity.
As noted in the APELL Feedback and the OFE Feasibility Study, the complexity of modern software supply
chains makes vulnerabilities inevitable. In a proprietary model, the user is entirely dependent on the
vendorâs willingness and timeline to patch a flaw.
In the open-source model, security is a collective endeavor. Vulnerabilities can be identified and
remediated by a global community of security researchers, independent auditors, and peer organizations.
Furthermore, open source enables the generation of accurate Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs),
which are essential for mapping dependencies and managing supply chain risks (a key requirement of the
Cyber Resilience Act). This capability allows organizations to proactively manage their risk posture rather
than passively trusting a vendorâs marketing claims.
4. Permissionless Innovation and Economic Competitiveness
For the private sector, particularly SMEs, the primary added value is âpermissionless innovation.â The
European digital economy is built upon open source foundations (Linux, Python, PHP, PostgreSQL,
MySQL, etc.). These technologies provide a standardized, high-quality industrial base that companies can
leverage instantly without negotiating legal contracts or paying upfront license fees.
This accelerates time-to-market and lowers barriers to entry for European startups. Instead of reinventing
the wheel, European companies can focus their R&D budget on high-value vertical applications (the
âEuroStack industryâ) while relying on shared open source building blocks for the infrastructure layer.
This collaborative model prevents the duplication of effort and allows European SMEs to compete globally
by standing on the shoulders of the open-source ecosystem.

5. Environmental Sustainability and Hardware Longevity
Finally, open source creates significant value in the context of the Green Deal and circular economy.
Proprietary software often drives âplanned obsolescenceâ by artificially limiting support for older hardware
(e.g., Windows 11 hardware requirements rendering hundreds of millions of perfectly functional PCs
obsolete).
Open source operating systems and applications are typically much more resource-efficient and can be
maintained on older hardware for significantly longer periods. This extends the lifecycle of IT equipment,
drastically reducing electronic waste and the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing new devices.
For public administrations managing vast fleets of hardware, this represents a massive ecological and
financial saving, aligning digital strategy with environmental responsibility.

C. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at
EU level to support the development and growth of the EU
open-source sector?
We propose in this document 28 concrete measures, while referring to the roadmap âThe Open Source
Way to EU Digital Sovereignty & Competitivenessâ published by the European Alliance for Industrial Data,
Edge and Cloud last year for additional propositions. All of these measures stem from discussions
conducted during workshops at CNLL, APELL and at the Commission (e.g. âOpen Source Beyond 2020â in
2019 and âOpen Source Sustainability Workshopâ in 2021) over the last 10+ years.

Pillar 1: Technological Strategy & Industrial Sovereignty
Strategic Objective: Move Europe from a posture of âpassive consumptionâ to âactive stewardshipâ of the
digital infrastructure. This pillar acknowledges that code is global, but jurisdiction, governance, and
supply chain security are local.

1. Implement a âSovereignty Risk Assessment Frameworkâ
Context: A simplistic âBuy Europeanâ rule for software code is technically unfeasible (modern software
supply chains are global) and potentially counter-productive (cutting Europe off from global innovation
like Linux or the Python ecosystem). However, blindly adopting non-EU technology creates unacceptable
legal risks.
â¢ The Proposition: The Commission must establish a standardized Risk Assessment Framework (a
  âSovereignty Scorecardâ) for software components used in critical public infrastructure.
â¢ Detailed Criteria:
  â£ Extraterritorial Exposure: Is the software vendor or the foundation controlling the project subject
    to extraterritorial laws (e.g., US FISA 702, CLOUD Act, Chinese National Intelligence Law) that could
    compel data access or backdoors?
  â£ Export Control Risk: Is the software subject to export administration regulations (e.g., US EAR) that
    could allow a foreign government to unilaterally revoke Europeâs right to use or update the software
    (the âkill switchâ scenario)?
  â£ Governance Autonomy: If the main vendor disappears or sanctions are imposed, can the project be
    legally and technically âforkedâ and maintained by European entities? (This requires a minima OSI-
    compliant licensing + availability of build scripts/documentation).
  â£ Supply Chain Auditability: Does the project provide a complete Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
    and reproducible builds to verify no tampering occurred between source code and binary?
  â£ Expertise in Europe: Does a sufficiently robust ecosystem of European developers, vendors and
    service providers exist that can maintain, patch, and evolve the software? Sovereignty is not just legal
    ownership of the code; it is the operational capability to intervene on it (Level 3 support) without
    relying on the original non-EU vendor.
â¢ Nuance: High-risk components (e.g., non-EU encryption modules) might be banned for Critical systems
  (Defense, Health) but acceptable for General use if mitigated by European support contracts.
â¢ Sources: CNLL Doctrine on Legal Immunity; Cloud-Edge Alliance Roadmap (Pillar 5 - Governance).

2. Develop Sector-Specific Reference Architectures
Context: Fragmentation is Europeâs weakness. If every Member State builds its own custom âsovereign
cloudâ or âsmart cityâ stack from scratch, the market remains too small for any European vendor to scale.
â¢ The Proposition: The Commission should fund the definition and maintenance of Open Source
  Reference Architectures for critical verticals (Healthcare, Education, Smart Cities, Energy Gridsâ¦).
â¢ Detailed Action:
  â£ Standardization by Code: Instead of just writing PDF standards, fund the integration of existing
    European open source components into deployable âReference Stacksâ.
  â£ Interoperability by Design: These architectures must mandate specific open APIs for all internal
    modules, ensuring that components can be swapped (e.g., replacing one chat module with another) to
    prevent lock-in even within the open stack.
  â£ Industrialization: These architectures serve as the âblueprint.â European SMEs and integrators then
    compete to deploy, host, and maintain these specific stacks for public administrations, creating a
    unified market demand.
â¢ Sources: Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 1); EuroStack (Industrialization).

3. Secure the Supply Chain via an EU Sovereign Tech Fund (EU-STF)
Context: The âInnovation Trap.â Public funding (Horizon Europe) loves ânewâ features. It rarely funds the
unglamorous work of maintaining 15-year-old libraries (like OpenSSL or Log4j) that run the internet. This
under-funding creates security holes that threaten European industry.
â¢ The Proposition: Establish a dedicated financial instrument (EU-STF), modeled on the German
  Sovereign Tech Fund, with a budget of at least â¬350M over 7 years.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Focus on ODBTs: Funding is strictly restricted to Open Digital Base Technologies (foundational
    libraries, protocols, build tools, kernels). It is not for building commercial products.
  â£ Direct Procurement of Maintainers: Unlike grant-based research projects (which are
    administratively heavy), the EU-STF should use agile procurement to pay maintainers (individuals or
    non-profits) directly for specific tasks: security audits, refactoring legacy code, writing documentation,
    and generating SBOMs.
  â£ Security as a Public Good: This acts as a subsidy to the security of the entire European economy,
    fixing vulnerabilities âupstreamâ so every European company benefits âdownstream.â
â¢ Sources: OFE Feasibility Study; APELL; Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 4).

4. Mandate âEnforceable Interoperabilityâ
Context: âOpen Washing.â Non-EU hyperscalers often claim to support open standards while subtly
breaking interoperability (e.g., âembrace, extend, extinguishâ tactics) or using âFRANDâ (Fair, Reasonable,
and Non-Discriminatory) patent terms that are incompatible with Open Source licensing.
â¢ The Proposition: Move from âencouraging standardsâ to âEnforceable Interoperabilityâ legislation.
â¢ Detailed Action:
  â£ Strict Definition (EIFv1): Mandate that âOpen Standardâ in public procurement must mean: Royalty-
    Free, specifications publicly available, and no constraints on reuse (making them compatible with, e.g.,
    GPL/MIT/Apache licenses).
  â£ Data Portability Rights: Grant public administrations a legal right to bulk data extraction in a
    standard format (with metadata) within a set timeframe (e.g., 48 hours) to ensure reversibility is real,
    not theoretical.
  â£ Anti-Lock-in APIs: For cloud services, mandate the implementation of standard, vendor-neutral APIs
    (like S3 for storage, or OIDC for identity) rather than proprietary APIs that force code rewrites during
    migration.
â¢ Sources: CNLL Position on Interoperability; Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 1).

5. Support âPermissionless Innovationâ in AI
Context: The AI âBlack Box.â If the future of software is AI, and AI models are closed, European sovereignty
is dead. Relying on âOpen AIâ (the company) is the opposite of Open Source.
â¢ The Proposition: Ensure that EU industrial policy actively discriminates in favor of Open Science AI
  to prevent monopolization.
â¢ Detailed Action:
  â£ The âThree Opensâ: EU funding for AI must require: Open Weights (the model), Open Data (the
    training set description/access), and Open Code (the training/inference scripts).
  â£ Sovereign Training Infrastructure: Guarantee affordable access to EuroHPC supercomputers for
    European open source AI developers, on the condition that their output remains open (preventing the
    privatization of public compute resources).
  â£ Legal Clarity: Explicitly clarify in the AI Act implementation that open source developers and non-
    commercial researchers are in a âSafe Harborâ regarding liability, to prevent a chilling effect on EU AI
    innovation.
â¢ Sources: CNLL/APELL positions on AI Act; Cloud-Edge Roadmap.

6. Facilitate a âTechnical Assistance Facilityâ
Context: The âCapability Gap.â A small municipality or hospital wants to use sovereign open source, but
lacks the engineering talent to integrate disparate components. They default to Microsoft/Google because
itâs an âintegrated suite,â even if illegal (Schrems II).
â¢ The Proposition: Create a mechanism (potentially via the DC-EDIC) to act as a Technical Assistance
  Facility for the public sector.
â¢ Detailed Action:
  â£ Migration Coaching: Fund experts to help public administrations map their current dependencies
    and design migration paths to open source.
  â£ The âWhite Listâ (Solutions Directory): Maintain a dynamic catalog of verified, industrial-grade
    European Open Source solutions that meet the âSovereignty Risk Assessmentâ (Point 1). This de-
    risks the choice for public CIOs.
  â£ Pre-Packaged Distributions: Fund the packaging of the âReference Architecturesâ (Point 2) into
    easy-to-deploy distributions that competing European hosters can offer as a managed service.
â¢ Sources: EuroStack position on DC-EDIC; Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 3).

Pillar 2: Public Procurement as a Market Shaper
Strategic Objective: Leverage the massive purchasing power of the European public sector (approx. â¬2
trillion/year, or 14% of GDP) to de-risk the market for European SMEs, break vendor lock-in, and enforce
digital sovereignty through the âpower of the purse.â

7. Enact âOpen Source Firstâ Legislation (The âComply or Explainâ Principle)
Context: Voluntary guidelines (like the EIF) have failed to shift market behavior significantly. Public buyers
exhibit âdefensive buyingâ inertia, defaulting to large proprietary incumbents due to perceived safety,
despite the long-term risks of lock-in and data leakage.
â¢ The Proposition: Elevate âOpen Source Firstâ from a recommendation to a binding legal principle in
  public procurement directives.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Reversal of the Burden of Proof: Public buyers should default to Open Source solutions. If a
    proprietary solution is chosen, the buyer must publish a âComply or Explainâ justification.
  â£ Public Justification Requirements: The explanation must explicitly address why an existing open
    source alternative was rejected. It must quantify the Exit Costs (cost to migrate away in the future)
    and verify the Data Sovereignty status of the chosen proprietary tool.
  â£ Transparency: These justifications should be publicly searchable to allow scrutiny by civil society
    and the OSS ecosystem, creating accountability for lazy procurement.
â¢ Sources: APELL (Measure 3); Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 3); CNLL Position.

8. Mandate âEuropean Preferenceâ in Service Procurement
Context: While software code is global, the legal jurisdiction of the service provider is local. Buying
maintenance, support, or cloud services for open source software from a non-EU company negates the
sovereignty benefits, as the service remains subject to extraterritorial laws (e.g., FISA 702).
â¢ The Proposition: While the software code can be international, the contracting entity for integration,
  hosting, maintenance, etc., should ideally be European.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Jurisdictional Tenders: Tenders for critical systems should require the prime contractor to be
    headquartered in the EU/EEA and not subject to extraterritorial control orders from foreign
    governments.
  â£ Economic Value Retention: This ensures that tax revenues and high-skilled jobs (support engineers,
    R&D) remain in Europe. Even if the core software is global (e.g., Linux), the value-added layer (security
    hardening, integration, managed services) is provided by European industry.
  â£ Legal Recourse: A European public administration must have legal recourse under EU law against its
    critical IT suppliers, which is difficult when contracting with EU subsidiaries of foreign entities
    shielded by parent company jurisdictions.
â¢ Sources: Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 3); CNLL Doctrine on Strategic Autonomy.

9. Implement Binding âSovereignty Criteriaâ (Pass/Fail)
Context: Current tenders often focus purely on feature lists (âfunctional requirementsâ) which are easily
gamed by incumbents, ignoring the strategic risks of the supplierâs origin.
â¢ The Proposition: Introduce mandatory non-functional criteria related to digital sovereignty in all
  public tenders for critical digital infrastructure.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Legal Immunity: For critical data, the vendor must guarantee immunity from non-EU extraterritorial
    data access requests. This acts as a de facto filter against US hyperscalers for sensitive sovereign
    clouds.
  â£ Data Residency & Control: Mandatory location of data and metadata within the EU, with operations
    performed by EU-cleared personnel (sovereign operations).
  â£ Full Code Auditability: The vendor must be able to provide the full source code for security
    auditing. This effectively disqualifies proprietary âblack boxesâ where the client cannot verify security
    claims.
â¢ Sources: EuroStack (Criteria definition); APELL; CNLL.

10. Break the âIntermediary Value Trapâ (Allotment Strategy)
Context: This is the most critical economic failure identified by the CNLL. Public administrations sign
massive framework contracts with large Systems Integrators (ESNs - Entreprises de Service du NumÃ©rique).
These integrators deploy Open Source software but keep the margin, paying zero or negligible amounts to
the actual Software Vendors (Ãditeurs) who create and maintain the code. This starves the producers of the
technology.
â¢ The Proposition: Issue specific guidance on Allotment (Allotissement) to ensure value flows to the
  creators.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Separation of Concerns: Public tenders involving OSS should be split into at least two distinct lots:
    1. Lot 1: Software Subscription/Support: Contracted directly with the Software Publisher (or their
       authorized distributor). This covers âVendor Support,â security patches, roadmap influence, and
       R&D funding.
    2. Lot 2: Integration & Managed Services: Contracted with Systems Integrators for deployment,
       customization, and training.
  â£ Fair Share: This ensures that the SME writing the code receives recurring revenue, allowing them to
    invest in security and innovation, rather than the Integrator capturing all the value while contributing
    nothing to the upstream maintenance.
â¢ Sources: CNLL (15+ years of market observation); Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Growth & Investment).

11. Mandate âPublic Money, Public Codeâ
Context: The public sector often pays for custom software development (e.g., a new portal for a ministry)
but allows the contractor to keep the IP or simply forgets to publish the code. This is a waste of public
funds and prevents reuse by other member states.
â¢ The Proposition: Software developed specifically for the public sector with public funds must be Open
  Source by Default.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Default Licensing: Contracts for custom development must mandate delivery under an OSI-approved
    license (e.g., EUPL).
  â£ Repository Requirement: The delivered code must be published in a public repository (e.g.,
    code.europa.eu or national equivalent) before final payment is released.
  â£ Exemptions: Exceptions for security-sensitive logic (e.g., fraud detection algorithms) or third-party IP
    must be justified and minimized (e.g., segregating sensitive configuration from the open codebase).
    Exemptions should concern only the sensitive parts, and not be used as an excuse to not publish
    anything at all.
â¢ Sources: FSFE; APELL; Cloud-Edge Roadmap.
12. Support a âWhite Listâ / Solutions Directory (Industrial Grade)
Context: Public buyers are risk-averse. They fear âabandonwareâ or hobbyist projects. They need a trusted
signal that a specific European OSS solution is enterprise-ready.
â¢ The Proposition: The Commission (potentially via the DC-EDIC, or another structure dedicated to the
  promotion of Open Source) should support the maintenance of a Catalog of Industrial-Grade
  European Open Source Solutions.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Vetting Criteria: Inclusion in the catalog is not automatic. Solutions must pass the âSovereignty Risk
    Assessmentâ (Pillar 1) and demonstrate Industrial Maturity (active maintenance, existence of a legal
    entity for support, GDPR compliance, SBOM availability).
  â£ Not a Repository, a Buyerâs Guide: This is not GitHub. It is a procurement aid that lists: âHere is the
    software, here is the European company that provides enterprise support, here are the references in
    other public administrations.â
â¢ Sources: Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 3); EuroStack Directory Project.

13. Mandate TCO Calculation including Exit Costs
Context: Proprietary vendors often win tenders with low initial prices (discounted licenses) but trap
administrations with massive price hikes later. Because migration is technically difficult (lock-in),
administrations cannot leave.
â¢ The Proposition: Procurement rules must require a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculation that
  includes the Exit Strategy.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Reversibility Cost: Tenders must evaluate the cost of extracting data and migrating to a rival
    solution at the end of the contract.
  â£ The OSS Advantage: Since OSS uses open standards and has no license fees, its âExit Costâ and long-
    term TCO are significantly lower. Making this calculation mandatory exposes the hidden costs of
    proprietary lock-in.
â¢ Sources: CNLL; Cloud-Edge Roadmap.*

14. Leverage Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP)
Context: Sometimes, the market does not yet offer a sovereign solution for a specific need (e.g., a specific
AI tool for healthcare).
â¢ The Proposition: Use Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) instruments to co-fund the development
  of missing open source building blocks.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Market Creation: The public sector acts as the âfirst customer,â defining the need and funding the
    R&D phase for a consortium of European SMEs to build the solution.
  â£ Open Output: The resulting IP is released as Open Source, creating a new âcommonâ that the private
    sector can then commercialize and support.
â¢ Sources: Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 3).

Pillar 3: Investment & Financing the Digital Public Good
Strategic Objective: Solve the âDual Tragedy of the Commonsâ (under-provision of maintenance
resources vs. over-exploitation by commercial free-riders) and the âInnovation Trapâ (funding only new
features, never maintenance) through structured, long-term financing.
15. Operationalize the EU Sovereign Tech Fund (EU-STF)
Context: The current EU funding landscape (Horizon Europe, Digital Europe) is designed for Innovation
(creating new technologies/features) and Research. It is structurally incapable of funding Maintenance
(security hardening, refactoring, bug fixing, documentation) of existing, mature technologies. This leaves
critical infrastructure (Open Digital Base Technologies - ODBTs) vulnerable (e.g., the Log4j crisis).
â¢ The Proposition: Establish a permanent financial instrument, the EU Sovereign Tech Fund, modeled
  on the successful German Sovereign Tech Fund.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Scope: Strictly focused on âUpstreamâ technologyâlibraries, protocols, build chains, and kernels that
    underpin the European digital economy. It excludes commercial âDownstreamâ products (apps).
  â£ Modality: Unlike research grants (which are slow and bureaucratic), the EU-STF must use agile
    procurement to contract directly with maintainers (individuals, non-profits, or SMEs) for specific
    roadmaps.
  â£ Budget: A recommended minimum of â¬350M over 7 years to ensure critical mass.
  â£ Implementation: This could be implemented via a dedicated agency or by leveraging the DC-EDIC
    as a vehicle to pool Member State contributions alongside Commission funding.
â¢ Sources: OFE Feasibility Study (Comprehensive design); Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 4); German STF
  experience.

16. Incentivize Private Co-Investment (Tax Credits & Matching)
Context: Large non-EU corporations generate billions in revenue using Open Source components but often
contribute little back to the European maintenance ecosystem (âFree-Ridingâ). Voluntary contribution
models have proven insufficient.
â¢ The Proposition: Use fiscal policy to incentivize private companies to invest in the open source
  builiding blocks they rely on.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Tax Credits for Contribution: Introduce a specific tax credit (similar to the R&D Tax Credit in
    France) for developer time spent contributing to recognized Open Source projects or foundations.
  â£ Matching Funds: Create a mechanism where the EU matches private donations to qualified European
    Open Source Foundations (e.g., Eclipse, OW2, Apache Europe). If a European SME donates â¬50k to
    secure a library, the EU adds â¬50k, doubling the impact.
  â£ Conditionality: These incentives must be tied to public code contributions or direct financial
    support to the project governance, not internal R&D that remains proprietary.
â¢ Sources: OFE Feasibility Study; Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Growth & Investment).

17. Establish a European Open Source Investment Platform (EOSIP)
Context: European investors (VCs) often struggle to understand Open Source business models. They look
for âIP ownershipâ and âLicensing moats,â whereas Open Source business models rely on service, support,
and âOpen Coreâ strategies. This leads to a funding gap for OSS startups in the scale-up phase.
â¢ The Proposition: Create a specialized investment platform or âFund of Fundsâ to de-risk investment in
  OSS SMEs.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Education for Investors: Provide training to European investment banks and VCs on how to value
    Open Source companies (valuing community traction and adoption over IP locking).
  â£ De-Risking: Use InvestEU guarantees to back private funds that specialize in Open Source
    technologies (Deep Tech).
  â£ Sovereignty Clause: Investment agreements should include clauses preventing the transfer of critical
    IP or governance control to non-EU entities during future exit/acquisition events (preventing the âbuy
    and closeâ strategy of US competitors).
â¢ Sources: Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 4).

18. Support and Institutionalize âBlue Hatsâ Communities
Context: The âBlue Hatsâ concept (civil servants contributing code back to the digital public goods) is
currently a collection of informal initiatives or best practices (e.g., in Franceâs DINUM). It lacks
institutional weight, budget, and legal clarity.
â¢ The Proposition: Transform âBlue Hatsâ from a community of practice into a funded institutional
  program.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Legal Framework: Provide clear legal guidelines (or a directive) allowing public sector employees to
    contribute code and time to external Open Source projects during working hours without intellectual
    property friction.
  â£ Time Budgeting: Encourage public administrations to allocate a specific percentage of IT staff time
    (e.g., 10%) to upstream contribution, recognizing this as âpreventative maintenanceâ for their own
    infrastructure.
  â£ Recognition: Create EU-level awards and recognition for public administrations that are top
    contributors, fostering a culture of prestige around code contribution.
â¢ Sources: CNLL; DINUM (France); Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 2).

19. Redirect and Earmark Horizon / Digital Europe Funds
Context: Billions are spent on research (Horizon Europe), but the software outputs often become
âabandonwareâ once the grant ends because there is no funding for the transition from âResearch
Prototypeâ to âIndustrial Product,â nor for the maintenance of the underlying grassroots ecosystem. Large
consortia monopolize funding, while the SMEs and individual maintainers building the actual Digital
Commons are excluded by administrative complexity.
â¢ The Proposition: Rebalance existing funds to support the lifecycle of software (maintenance) and
  grassroots innovation (small players).
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Institutionalize âCascade Fundingâ (FSTP): The Commission must make Financial Support to
    Third Parties (Cascade Funding) a standard instrument across Digital Europe and Horizon Europe. As
    proven by the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiativeâwhich successfully funded over 1,000
    projectsâthis is the only mechanism agile enough to reach the deep-tech SMEs and maintainers who
    build the Open Internet Stack. Abandoning this model would sever the lifeline of the European
    grassroots ecosystem.
  â£ Earmarked Maintenance Calls: Launch calls dedicated exclusively to the maturation,
    documentation, and security hardening of existing European OSS prototypes. Banning the
    development of ânew featuresâ in these calls forces a focus on stability and industrial readiness.
  â£ The âSustainability Checkâ: Require all software-heavy Horizon Europe projects to include a
    funded plan for transfer to an Open Source Foundation or continued community maintenance after the
    project ends.
  â£ Open Science Default: Mandate that software produced by EU-funded research must be Open Source
    (Open Science), preventing the privatization of public research results.
â¢ Sources: Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 4); CNLL Position on NGI (2024).

Pillar 4: Skills, Education & Workforce
Strategic Objective: Build a sovereign talent pipeline to reduce reliance on non-EU expertise and correct
the âvendor lock-in of the mindâ that occurs when students are trained solely on proprietary platforms.
20. Integrate OSS into STEM Curricula (Primary to University)
Context: Currently, many European educational institutions act as sales channels for non-EU hyperscalers
(e.g., âGoogle Classroomâ, âMicrosoft for Educationâ), training students to be consumers of specific
proprietary products rather than digitally literate citizens. This creates a long-term cultural lock-in.
â¢ The Proposition: Mandate the integration of Open Source principles, development practices, and legal
  frameworks into national computer science and civic education curricula.
â¢ Detailed Action:
  â£ Digital Civics: Teach the concepts of open standards, data privacy, and digital sovereignty as part of
    general digital literacy, using OSS tools to demonstrate transparency.
  â£ Technical Curricula: Computer Science degrees must include mandatory modules on OSS
    Licensing (IP law), Community Governance, and Distributed Development (Git flows, peer
    review).
  â£ Infrastructure: Encourage schools and universities to use open source software for their own
    operations (LMS, cloud), serving as a real-world example to students (âPractice what you teachâ).
â¢ Sources: Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 2); CNLL Advocacy; APELL.

21. Create EU-Recognized Certifications (Countering Proprietary Standards)
Context: HR departments and public tenders often require certifications like âAWS Certifiedâ or âMicrosoft
Certified Professional.â There is a lack of recognized credentials for European/Sovereign technologies,
making it hard for European engineers to prove their value and for companies to hire them.
â¢ The Proposition: Develop and promote a standard framework of European Digital Sovereignty
  Certifications.
â¢ Detailed Action:
  â£ Standardization: Collaborate with industry bodies to create certifications for key roles: âCertified
    European Cloud Architect,â âSovereign Identity Specialist,â or âOpen Source Compliance Officer.â
  â£ Recognition: Ensure these certifications are recognized in public procurement tenders as valid proof
    of technical capacity, equivalent to or preferred over vendor-specific proprietary certifications.
  â£ Focus on ODBTs: Certifications should focus on the underlying open technologies and standards
    (e.g., POSIX/Single Unix Specification/Linux Standard Base/â¦, Matrix, etc.) rather than a specific
    vendorâs implementation, promoting workforce mobility and resilience.
â¢ Sources: Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 2 - Skills Development).

22. Launch âOpen Source Businessâ Vocational Training
Context: Europe produces brilliant code but often fails to build sustainable businesses around it. Many
creators give up or sell to US companies because they lack expertise in Open Source Business Models
(e.g., Open Core, SaaS, Support subscriptions) and IP strategy.
â¢ The Proposition: Create targeted vocational training programs for entrepreneurs, SME managers, and
  incubator cohorts.
â¢ Detailed Action:
  â£ Curriculum: Focus on monetization strategies that respect open source values while ensuring
    revenue (avoiding the âfree workâ trap). Teach defensive IP strategy and community management.
  â£ Target Audience: Deep-tech startups, university spin-offs, and SMEs looking to pivot from a âcustom
    developmentâ service model to a âsoftware publisherâ product model.
  â£ Public Purchasers Training: Crucially, extend this training to public procurement officers so they
    understand the difference between purchasing a license and purchasing a subscription/maintenance
    contract for OSS.
â¢ Sources: CNLL (PME support); Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 2).
23. Establish âCentres of Excellenceâ in Universities
Context: The maintenance of critical âdeep techâ layers (kernels, compilers, cryptography) requires highly
specialized skills that are becoming rare. There is a risk of a âbrain drainâ of these specialists to non-EU
tech giants.
â¢ The Proposition: Fund university-based Centres of Excellence for Open Digital Infrastructure.
â¢ Detailed Action:
  â£ Research & Maintenance: These centres should not just do abstract research but actively participate
    in the maintenance of critical global projects (e.g., the Linux Kernel, GCC, cryptographic libraries),
    ensuring Europe retains âmaintainer seatsâ at the global table.
  â£ Dual Track: Offer tracks for both academic research and applied engineering, allowing students to get
    academic credit for contributing to major open source projects.
â¢ Sources: Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Pillar 2); EuroStack.

24. Promote Diversity & Inclusion in the Contributor Community
Context: The open source contributor base is historically homogenous. This limits innovation and excludes
large segments of the European population from the digital economy.
â¢ The Proposition: Create specific grant programs and mentorship initiatives to support under-
  represented groups.
â¢ Detailed Action:
  â£ Fellowships: Provide stipends for women and under-represented minorities to work on open source
    projects, mirroring successful programs like âOutreachyâ but with EU funding and a focus on
    European strategic projects.
  â£ Safe Spaces: Enforce Codes of Conduct in EU-funded projects to ensure welcoming environments for
    diverse contributors.
â¢ Sources: APELL; General ecosystem best practices.

Pillar 5: Governance & Regulatory Coherence
Strategic Objective: Move from a fragmented landscape to a unified European voice. Ensure that the legal
environment provides certainty and protection for open collaboration, preventing âregulatory chill.â

25. Implement a Mandatory âOSS Checkâ (Impact Assessment)
Context: Recent legislative initiatives (e.g., the Cyber Resilience Act, the Product Liability Directive) created
near-existential crises for the open source ecosystem because they were initially drafted with proprietary,
vertical business models in mind. They failed to account for the decentralized, often non-commercial
nature of open source production.
â¢ The Proposition: Introduce a systematic, mandatory Open Source Impact Assessment for all new
  digital legislation before it enters the legislative process.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Structural Evaluation: Every Digital DG proposal must evaluate its impact on: non-profit
    foundations, individual developers, and SME-led open source projects.
  â£ The âSovereignty Testâ: Legislation must be checked to ensure it does not inadvertently advantage
    non-EU hyperscalers (who have large compliance departments) over European open source SMEs
    (who do not).
  â£ Consultation Protocol: Mandatory consultation with representative bodies of the OSS industry (like
    APELL/CNLL) during the drafting phase, not just the public consultation phase.
â¢ Sources: APELL (Measure 4); CNLL Response to CRA.
26. Appoint an âOpen Source Envoyâ
Context: Open Source touches competition policy (DG COMP), industrial strategy (DG GROW), research
(DG RTD), and internal IT (DG DIGIT). Currently, responsibility is fragmented, leading to policy
incoherence (e.g., funding open source in Horizon Europe while threatening it with liability in the CRA).
â¢ The Proposition: Designate a European Open Source Envoy, a high-level official with a political
  mandate to champion the sector.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Cross-Directorate Mandate: The Envoy coordinates between DGs to ensure the â1-2-3
    Principleâ (Open Source First, European Preference, Risk Assessment) is applied consistently.
  â£ Ambassador Role: The Envoy represents the EUâs open source strategy to Member States, urging
    them to align national policies, and serves as the primary interlocutor for the ecosystem.
  â£ Sovereignty Guardian: This role specifically oversees the âSovereignty Risk Assessmentsâ to ensure
    they are not diluted by foreign lobbying.
â¢ Sources: APELL (Measure 3); Cloud-Edge Roadmap (Governance).

27. Formalize and Fund the Network of OSPOs
Context: The European Commissionâs OSPO is a success, as are national initiatives like Germanyâs ZenDiS
or Franceâs Mission Logiciels Libres. However, they operate largely as a loose coalition of the willing.
â¢ The Proposition: Institutionalize the European Network of OSPOs as a funded, operational body.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Connecting the Layers: Create a formal structure linking the EC OSPO, Member State OSPOs, and
    Regional/City OSPOs.
  â£ Mutualization: Use this network to share code (Inner Source becoming Open Source), procurement
    templates, and legal analysis. If one country audits a piece of software, the result is shared instantly
    across the network.
  â£ Capacity Building: Provide funding to help smaller Member States establish their own national
    OSPOs.
â¢ Sources: CNLL Position Paper on OSPOs; OFE; Cloud-Edge Roadmap.

28. Create Legal âSafe Harborsâ for Maintainers
Context: The fear of liability is a massive barrier. If an individual or an SME publishes code for free, they
should not be liable for millions of euros in damages if a bank uses it and gets hacked. Without clear
boundaries, European developers will stop publishing code or move to jurisdictions with better
protections.
â¢ The Proposition: Explicitly codify the âUpstream Exemptionâ in EU law.
â¢ Detailed Mechanism:
  â£ Commercial vs. Non-Commercial: Clear legal definitions distinguishing between âplacing a
    product on the marketâ (commercial activity subject to liability) and âpublishing codeâ (free speech/
    scientific contribution exempt from liability).
  â£ Steward Protection: Specific legal protections for non-profit Open Source Foundations (Stewards)
    that host infrastructure but do not control the commercial use of the software.
â¢ Sources: APELL; OFE Feasibility Study; CRA

D. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
Based on the ârisk-basedâ doctrine and the industrial analysis provided by the Cloud-Edge Alliance
Roadmap and EuroStack, the prioritization of technology areas should not be based on âtrends,â but on
Strategic Dependency and Industrial Potential.
The Commission must prioritize areas where Vendor Lock-in is currently highest (posing an economic
threat) and where Extraterritorial Risk is most acute (posing a sovereignty threat).
We propose prioritizing four strategic clusters:

1. The Cloud-Edge-IoT Continuum (The Industrial Backbone)
Context: As detailed in the Cloud-Edge Alliance Roadmap, this is the battlefield for Industry 4.0. Currently,
the market is dominated by non-EU hyperscalers, creating a risk that European industrial data (factory
data, energy grids, mobility) becomes captured in proprietary silos subject to foreign jurisdiction.
â¢ Priority Technologies:
  â£ Orchestration & Containerization: cloud orchestration and management tools that allow workloads
    to move freely between clouds (reversibility).
  â£ Edge Computing Operating Systems: Lightweight, secure open OS for industrial controllers and
    IoT gateways, preventing a âAndroid-izationâ of European industry by non-EU platforms.
  â£ Federated Data Infrastructure: Connectors and dataspace components (based on DSBA standards)
    to enable secure data sharing without centralization.
â¢ Why Prioritize?
  â£ Sovereignty: To ensure European industrial data remains under EU jurisdiction.
  â£ Resilience: Edge computing requires autonomy; a factory must keep running even if the connection
    to a US cloud is severed.

2. The Digital Workplace & Collaboration (The Public Sector Lock-in)
Context: This is the primary source of value leakage in the public sector. As noted by the CNLL, public
administrations are massively dependent on Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. This creates a âdefaultâ
lock-in that dictates identity management, document formats, and communication channels, making it
nearly impossible to switch.
â¢ Priority Technologies:
  â£ Sovereign Collaboration Suites: Platforms combining file storage, document editing, chat, and video
    conferencing (e.g., XWiki, Matrix-based solutions, Jitsi/BigBlueButton/Galene, etc.).
  â£ The âSovereign PCâ (EU Linux / EU OS): A secure, Linux-based desktop operating system for
    public servants (as proposed in the EU OS project presentation) to break the hardware-software
    obsolescence cycle mandated by proprietary vendors (e.g., Windows 11 requirements).
  â£ Interoperable Office Formats: Strict enforcement of ODF (Open Document Format) over proprietary
    OOXML to ensure long-term archival sovereignty.
â¢ Why Prioritize?
  â£ Economic Efficiency: Stopping the massive outflow of license fees for âcommodityâ software.
  â£ Legal Immunity: Ensuring citizen data processed by civil servants (emails, documents) is never
    exposed to extraterritorial scanning.

3. Cybersecurity, Identity & Supply Chain (The Trust Layer)
Context: Security cannot be a âblack box.â The implementation of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and
eIDAS 2.0 requires technologies that are fully auditable. Relying on proprietary security tools from non-
EU vendors to protect European infrastructure is a strategic paradox.
â¢ Priority Technologies:
  â£ Digital Identity Wallets (EUDI): The reference implementations for the European Digital Identity
    Wallet must be fully open source to ensure citizen trust and prevent capture by private platforms
    (Apple/Google).
  â£ Supply Chain Security Tools: Automated tooling for generating Software Bills of Materials
    (SBOMs), vulnerability scanning, and reproducible builds.
  â£ Post-Quantum Cryptography: Open implementations of PQC algorithms to prepare European
    infrastructure for the quantum threat without relying on NSA-approved black boxes.
â¢ Why Prioritize?
  â£ Trust: Only open source allows for the collective verification required for critical identity and security
    infrastructure.
  â£ Compliance: To enable European SMEs to comply with the CRA without prohibitive costs.

4. Open Source AI & Data Infrastructure (The Future Frontier)
Context: There is a high risk that Artificial Intelligence becomes a âduopolyâ controlled by US and Chinese
tech giants. If the foundational models are proprietary, European innovation will be limited to âfine-
tuningâ rented models, creating a permanent dependency rent.
â¢ Priority Technologies:
  â£ Open Weights Models: Foundational models where the weights are public and the license permits
    commercial use without restrictions.
  â£ Open Training Datasets: Curated, legally cleared, multilingual European datasets (High-
    Performance Language Technologies) to train models that respect European cultures and languages.
  â£ AI Toolchains: Open source libraries for training and inference (e.g., PyTorch, scikit-learn) to ensure
    Europe retains the capability to build AI, not just use it.
â¢ Why Prioritize?
  â£ Permissionless Innovation: Preventing a scenario where European startups must ask permission
    (and pay API fees) to a non-EU gatekeeper to innovate.
  â£ Cultural Sovereignty: Ensuring AI models reflect European languages and values, not just English-
    centric data.

Summary of Priorities based on the â1-2-3 Doctrineâ
 Priority Area              Strategic Goal                    Key âSovereignty Criterionâ
 Cloud & Edge               Industrial Autonomy               Data Residency & Reversibility
 Digital Workplace          Public Sector Independence Legal Immunity & Zero Exit Costs
 Cybersecurity/ID           Trust & Compliance                Full Code Auditability
 Artificial Intelligence Future Competitiveness               Open Weights & Open Data

E. In what sectors could an increased use of open source
lead to increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
Based on the sectoral analysis provided in the Cloud-Edge Alliance Roadmap and the strategic
priorities identified by the CNLL and APELL, we identify five strategic sectors where the shift to Open
Source is not merely an IT upgrade, but a prerequisite for survival, sovereignty, and competitiveness.
In these sectors, the âRisk-Based Approachâ (Pillar 1) is paramount: reliance on âblack boxâ proprietary
software creates unacceptable systemic risks.

1. Public Administration: The Anchor of Sovereignty
Context: Public administrations are the largest collectors of citizen data. Currently, the sector suffers from
high fragmentation and massive value leakage through licensing fees to non-EU vendors (e.g., the
Microsoft Office monopoly).
â¢ Cyber Resilience Gains:
  â£ Continuity of Public Service: Open Source ensures that public services cannot be âswitched offâ by
    a foreign entity via sanctions or license revocation.
  â£ Auditability: As highlighted by the EU OS project, government workstations and servers are critical
    targets. Open source allows for collective security auditing of the code running the state, replacing
    blind trust with verification.
â¢ Competitiveness Gains:
  â£ Local Economic Multiplier: Shifting budget from âGlobal Licensesâ to âLocal Servicesâ (integration,
    maintenance) reinjects tax money into the European SME ecosystem (addressing the Intermediary
    Value Trap).
  â£ Interoperability: Mandating open standards prevents data silos between ministries, reducing
    administrative friction and cost.

2. Industry 4.0 & Manufacturing: Protecting the Value Chain
Context: Europe is a global leader in industrial machinery. As factories become software-defined, there is a
risk of âvalue captureâ where non-EU hyperscalers provide the âsmartâ layer (Cloud/AI), reducing
European manufacturers to mere hardware assemblers (âcommoditizationâ).
â¢ Cyber Resilience Gains:
  â£ Edge Autonomy: Factories must continue to operate even if the connection to the cloud is severed.
    Open source Edge Computing (as detailed in the Cloud-Edge Roadmap) allows for local, autonomous
    processing of industrial data.
  â£ Security through Obscurity is Dead: Industrial control systems (ICS) are prime targets for
    cyberwarfare. Open source stacks allow manufacturers to patch vulnerabilities instantly without
    waiting for a legacy vendorâs timeline.
â¢ Competitiveness Gains:
  â£ Avoiding the âAndroid-izationâ of Industry: By controlling the open source platforms (e.g.,
    Eclipse-based industrial IoT stacks), European manufacturers retain control over the data interface,
    preventing non-EU platforms from extracting the industrial data value.

3. Healthcare: Data Privacy and Research Velocity
Context: Health data is the most sensitive category under GDPR. The sector is currently plagued by
proprietary vendor lock-in that makes sharing patient data between hospitals technically and legally
difficult.
â¢ Cyber Resilience Gains:
  â£ Data Sovereignty: Open source Electronic Health Records (EHR) and infrastructure allow data to be
    hosted strictly within sovereign bounds (SecNumCloud, etc.), ensuring immunity from extraterritorial
    data access (FISA).
  â£ Long-Term Access: Medical records must remain readable for decades. Open standards guarantee
    that data is not lost if a proprietary vendor goes bankrupt or sunsets a product.
â¢ Competitiveness Gains:
  â£ Accelerated Research: Open source AI models and data frameworks allow research institutions to
    collaborate on drug discovery and diagnostics without navigating complex IP licensing webs for every
    tool used.
4. Energy & Utilities: Securing the Green Transition
Context: The transition to Smart Grids and renewables requires connecting millions of devices (solar
inverters, EV chargers, smart meters) from different vendors. Proprietary silos inhibit this necessary
orchestration.
â¢ Cyber Resilience Gains:
  â£ Supply Chain Transparency: Critical infrastructure requires a complete Software Bill of Materials
    (SBOM). Only open source allows utilities to fully map their software dependencies and assess risks
    (e.g., identifying a compromised library in a smart meter fleet).
â¢ Competitiveness Gains:
  â£ Standardization of the Edge: An open source âenergy operating systemâ (like the projects under the
    Linux Foundation Energy) allows European utilities to standardize device communication, lowering the
    barrier to entry for European hardware startups and integrators.

5. Education & Research: The Talent Pipeline
Context: As noted many times over the years by the CNLL, education is currently a primary vector for
vendor lock-in. Students trained exclusively on proprietary non-EU platforms enter the workforce with a
bias that perpetuates dependency.
â¢ Cyber Resilience Gains:
  â£ Privacy by Design: Schools handle data of minors. Open source platforms (e.g., Moodle,
    BigBlueButton) allow this data to be kept within school districts or national clouds, protecting children
    from data profiling by advertising giants.
â¢ Competitiveness Gains:
  â£ Deep Tech Skills: Students learning on Open Source systems can inspect the code and understand
    how it works. This produces engineers and creators, whereas proprietary tools produce mere users.
    This is the foundation of the future workforce required for Pillar 4 (Skills).

General Conclusion
The Conseil National du Logiciel Libre (CNLL), representing the French Open Source industry, urges the
European Commission to recognize that the era of âlaissez-faireâ in digital policy is over. The shift to Open
Source is no longer a matter of technical detail or a ânice-to-haveâ option; it is a structural macro-
economic imperative.
It represents the fundamental choice between a Europe that rents its digital future from foreign entitiesâ
remaining vulnerable to extraterritorial laws, price hikes, and supply chain shocksâand a Europe that
owns, secures, and maintains its own critical infrastructure.
The path to sovereignty requires moving from observation to industrial action. By implementing the
measures outlined in this consultation response, the Commission can unlock the immense potential of the
European ecosystem.
The time for fear and lamentation is over. The tools, the strategies, and the will exist. What we need now is
action. The Commission has the power to reshape Europeâs digital landscapeâto move from dependency
to sovereignty, from fragmentation to cohesion, and from observation to leadership. The European Open
Source industry is mature, aligned with European values, and ready to deliver. We call on the Commission
to provide the industrial policy framework that matches this ambition. The future of our digital
sovereignty is in our handsâletâs build it.
