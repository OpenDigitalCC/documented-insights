                              Contribution by RIOS

         to the Call for Evidence on European Open Digital Ecosystems
                  A Complementary Contribution to the OSBA Submission

Nature and Scope of This Contribution
RIOS (Rete Italiana Open Source) is the Italian network of open source companies. As a member of
APELL (Association Professionnelle EuropÃ©enne du Logiciel Libre), RIOS works in close coordination
with peer organisations across Europe, including the Open Source Business Alliance (OSBA) in
Germany.

This contribution is designed as a complement to the OSBA submission. RIOS fully endorses the
OSBA response to this Call for Evidence, which provides detailed answers to the five guiding
questions posed by the Commission. Rather than restating those answers, this document focuses
on three areas where we believe additional emphasis or different framing can strengthen the
European open source position.

The three themes addressed below are:

   1. Open source as a political choice - reframing open source from development methodology
      to sovereignty instrument
   2. The strategic role of OSPOs - moving beyond technical coordination toward decision-
      support capability
   3. Aggregation as a prerequisite for scale - reinforcing networks, foundations, and
      collaborative structures

1. Open Source as a Political Choice
The argument
Open source has proven to be one of the most effective methods for technological development.
But open source alone does not guarantee independence or sovereignty. Large US-based
technology companies use open source extensively while concentrating value extraction and
strategic control around proprietary platforms. China channels open source development with the
State as the primary beneficiary.

The European Union has followed a different path, placing people, rights, and communities at the
centre of its socio-economic model. This is a genuine alternative and should be reflected in EU
digital and industrial policies.

Open source should be recognised as a policy instrument supporting the Unionâs objectives on
technological sovereignty, competitiveness, and resilience. Framed this way, open source
becomes a means to pursue a European "third path": neither capital-centric nor state-centric, but
oriented towards collective benefit, pluralism, and democratic accountability.

Proposals
   â¢   Open source as structural competition policy: Open source prevents concentration by
       design: no artificial scarcity, no permanent lock-in, competition on service rather than on
       code ownership. The Commission should recognise this by coordinating industrial policy
        with competition policy: in concentrated markets, funding open source alternatives is
       competition policy.
   â¢   Contribution to digital commons in public contracts: Public procurement contracts that
       deploy open source components should include a "commons sustainability" clause: a small
       percentage of contract value (e.g., 1-2%) earmarked for the maintenance of upstream
       open source components used in the solution. This could flow through recognised
       foundations, maintainer funds, or the proposed EU Sovereign Tech Fund.
   â¢   Annual dependency assessment: The Commission should publish an annual report
       measuring EU dependency on non-European proprietary software in critical infrastructure,
       tracking progress toward open alternatives.

From policy intent to implementation: an organisational gap
In some Member States, including Italy (CAD art. 68&69), open source preference is already
embedded in national frameworks, yet often bypassed in practice through procurement design.
This highlights the need for an internal governance functionâsuch as an OSPOâcapable of
translating policy principles into concrete tender criteria and of ensuring accountability through
traceable assessments.â

2. The Strategic Role of OSPOs
The argument
The OSBA submission rightly stresses the importance of Open Source Program Offices and calls for
strengthening the EC OSPO. RIOS supports this and wants to add a point: OSPOs should not be
seen as technical units alone, but as strategic decision-support structures.

A common limitation in open source strategies is the focus on adoption without matching
investment in organisational capacity. Technological sovereignty does not derive solely from the
use of open source software. It comes from the ability to understand, govern, evolve, andâwhen
neededâreplace the technologies an organisation depends on. OSPOs are the institutional
embodiment of this capacity.

When adequately resourced and positioned, OSPOs can support evidence-based decision-making
in areas such as procurement, risk management, vendor relationships, and long-term
sustainability. Their relevance goes beyond public administrations to large enterprises, where
technology dependencies and supply-chain risks matter just as much. The work done within
structures such as TOSIT (The Open Source I Trust) shows how coordinated approaches to open
source governance can help large organisations align operational needs with strategic autonomy.
To maximise their systemic impact, OSPOs should be supported not only as internal organisational
units, but also as a shared interface between public administrations and enterprises operating
within the European open source ecosystem.
At Commission level, this could be achieved through a dual approach: on the one hand, by
financially supporting the creation and consolidation of OSPOs within public bodies; on the other
hand, by introducing incentive mechanisms in EU programmes and calls that recognise and reward
the presence of structured OSPOs within participating companies.
This would facilitate interaction between organisations that share a common governance
language, comparable objectives, and a long-term commitment to open source sustainability. In
this model, OSPOs become the mechanism through which strategic priorities, contribution
practices, and risk-sharing arrangements can be aligned across public administrations and
industry, as already demonstrated by coordinated initiatives among large enterprises.

Proposals
   â¢   Mandatory OSPOs for large public entities: EU institutions and agencies, and Member
       State administrations above a defined threshold (e.g., >1,000 IT staff), should be required
       to establish an OSPO within 3 years.
   â¢   OSPO competence framework: The Commission should develop a standard competence
       framework for OSPO staff, covering technical skills but also procurement law, licence
       compliance, community governance, and strategic planning. A certification programme
       should follow.
   â¢   Support for existing OSPO networks: Rather than creating new structures, the Commission
       should provide resources to existing networksâOSPO Alliance, CURIOSS, TODO Groupâto
       develop shared tooling, a common knowledge base, and regular coordination among
       institutional OSPOs across Europe.
   â¢   Strategic KPIs for OSPOs: OSPOs should be evaluated not only on operational metrics
       (projects tracked, licences reviewed) but on strategic outcomes: reduction in vendor lock-
       in, successful technology transitions, contributions to upstream projects, and procurement
       diversification. These indicators directly reflect the organisational capabilities that
       underpin technological sovereignty: the ability to switch, to sustain, to contribute
       upstream, and to avoid structural lock-in.
   â¢   OSPO-to-OSPO cooperation programme: A dedicated EU funding line should support
       bilateral and multilateral cooperation between OSPOs across Member Statesâjoint
       procurement, shared maintenance of critical components, staff exchanges.

3. Aggregation as a Prerequisite for Scale
The argument
A structural problem for European open source is fragmentation. Individual projects, companies,
or administrations often lack the scale to compete with global proprietary platforms or to sustain
long-term maintenance. Aggregation and cooperative models are needed to reach critical mass.

These models already exist:
   â¢   Networks of enterprises: RIOS, OSBA, CNLL and other APELL members aggregate
       professional open source companies at national level, creating trust frameworks and
       quality benchmarks.
   â¢   Open source foundations: Linux Foundation Europe, Eclipse Foundation, and others
       provide neutral governance and long-term stewardship for critical projects.
   â¢   OSPO networks: OSPO Alliance, TODO Group, and CURIOSS enable knowledge sharing
       among institutional open source offices.

Supporting these aggregation layers is a prerequisite for turning innovation into lasting European
capacity, shared standards, and reusable solutions.

The AI challenges
The rapid diffusion of artificial intelligence makes the question of scale unavoidable and highlights
three distinct approaches. In the United States, scale is largely driven by massive private capital
and vertically integrated platforms; in China, by state-directed coordination, including strong
support for open source as a strategic instrument.
Europe should pursue a third path: building scale through cooperation rather than concentration.
This implies promoting AI development models inspired by mature open source projects, where
structured governance, transparent contribution processes, and sustainable business models
coexist.
Such an approach is consistent with the Unionâs commitment to trustworthy and human-centric
AI, as reflected in the AI Act, and positions aggregation and open collaboration as practical
mechanisms to achieve scale while preserving pluralism, accountability, and long-term autonomy.

Proposals
   â¢   Recognise national OS enterprise networks as policy interlocutors: The Commission
       should establish criteria for recognising national networks of open source enterprises
       (RIOS, OSBA, CNLL, and others) and their European coordination (APELL) as qualified
       interlocutors for policy consultations and intermediaries for EU programmes.
   â¢   Quality certification framework: Recognition of quality certification in procurement: EU
       procurement guidelines should recognise certification by established networks and
       foundations as valid evidence of technical capacity and quality standards, on equal footing
       with vendor-specific certifications. This would reduce perceived risk for contracting
       authorities and create incentives for professional quality without distorting competition.
   â¢   Preferential procurement for certified providers: EU procurement guidelines should allow
       contracting authorities to use certification by recognised networks as a selection or award
       criterion, reducing risk and rewarding professional quality.
   â¢   European Open Source SME Fund: A dedicated equity or grant instrument should support
       growth-stage open source companies in Europe, addressing the documented gap in access
       to scale-up capital.
   â¢   Support AI development models inspired by mature open source projects, where
       structured governance, transparent contribution processes, and sustainable business
       models coexist, enabling European actors to aggregate capabilities and achieve scale in line
       with the AI Act.
Conclusion
European open digital ecosystems will not be strengthened by technology choices alone. They
require deliberate policy framing, organisational capacity, and collaborative structures capable of
operating at scale.

By recognising open source as a strategic policy asset, investing in OSPOs as decision-support
structures, and reinforcing aggregation models across enterprises, foundations, and OSPO
networks, the European Union can transform its existing strengths into long-term technological
sovereignty grounded in European values.

RIOS reiterates its endorsement of the Open Source Business Alliance submission and offers this
contribution in the same collaborative spirit that underpins the open source ecosystem. Additional
perspectives from other APELL members, including CNLL, further elaborate on procurement value-
chain dynamics and regulatory coherence.

RIOS remains available to contribute to continued, structured dialogue throughout the policy
lifecycle, from design to implementation.
