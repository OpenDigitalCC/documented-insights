Current state of the European Open Digital Ecosystem

Essential Concepts and Strengths
In this document, the term âOpen Digital Ecosystemâ will be used to designate
the set of actors, techniques, procedures, norms and technologies that work
together for the creation of modern infrastructures with these goals:
      â¢     achieve sustainable growth and development
      â¢     solve actual societal issues faced by people
      â¢     empower citizens to network and forge their own solutions
      â¢     create and share actionable knowledge to the citizens
      â¢     highly durable, environment-friendly and reusable
      â¢     secure
      â¢     privacy-preserving
      â¢     low maintenance
      â¢     highly interoperable
      â¢     flexible and adaptable to changing requirements and regulations
      â¢     efficient consumption of energy, people, and others resources
      â¢     with abundant documentation and training materials
      â¢     eased supplier switchover
      â¢     increase end user satisfaction
      â¢     easily used and adaptable to different languages and cultures
      â¢     follow to the Charter of Human Rights
      â¢     contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals

Main weaknesses of the Open Digital Ecosystem
Currently, the Open Digital Ecosystem, in Europe and elsewhere, faces several
challenges which reduce or hinder their growth and acceptance.
      â¢     Visibility
            Most communities and solutions lack, or are denied, visibility reducing
            the scope of situations in which they could be called upon to help, and

            also reducing their ability to acquire the funds and support for their
            self-sustenance
      â¢     Education
            Thereâs a lack of educational resources that hinder citizensâ ability to be
            active contributors to the ecosystems and better collaborate with
            existing actors
      â¢     Maintenance
            Most actors in the Ecosystem fail to gather enough resources to
            support the ongoing costs of the infrastructure required to maintain a
            continuous and consistent action and presence
      â¢     Fair Payment
            Most actors find their work is being used in commercial settings and
            products without any fair return and no visibility
      â¢     Fair Appraisal
            Most actors find themselves, their contributions, and their proposals
            consistently under evaluated, either as contributions in Society or, in a
            commercial setting, as sound and consistent offers
      â¢     Lack of Contributions
            Many organizations are found to be unable or unwilling to contribute
            back the Ecosystem, in any form or kind, even when they acknowledge
            its importance their for existence, reducing re-usability and
            improvements that could benefit all parties
      â¢     Locked Ecosystems
            The Open Digital Ecosystem is severely hampered by other ecosystems
            which preclude any free and fair access to their knowledge with
            patents, paywalls, terms of services, rights management, proprietary
            standards, and a lack of publicly available information, and other
            means, removing any possibility of interoperability, repair, re-usability
            and vendor replacement
      â¢     Knowledge
            Current knowledge of the Open Digital Ecosystem is still partial and
            incomplete, lacking the interest, funding and willingness of Academia
            to further analyze it and propose more consistent approaches to their
            actions

      â¢     Collaboration
            The Open Digital Ecosystem needs further collaborative initiatives with
            all Societal actors, mainly the Public and Private sector
      â¢     Accessibility and User Experience
            Thereâs a shortage of professionals for Accessibility and User
            Experience in the Ecosystem, hindering user adoption

The Added Value of the Open Digital Ecosystem
The Ecosystem has already been proven as an important player in all manners
and situations, being the main factor of improved and sustained quality in the
Software and Hardware Industries.
      â¢     Itâs present in the vast majority of software in use today, either as the
            main component or in many of internal components;
      â¢     Contributes to inter and intra industrial sector collaborations (e.g.
            FINOS, Eclipse SDV)
      â¢     Promotes the adoption of Open Standards, fostering interoperability
      â¢     Facilitates the creation on Open Data initiatives, in the Public and
            Private sectors
      â¢     Lowers the barriers of access to knowledge and training at all schools
            levels, and outside of the school system
      â¢     Forces organizations to be more transparent with their data acquisition
            and transformation processes
      â¢     Offers organizations and users more flexibility and choice of use and
            adaptation to their needs

Supporting the Open Digital Ecosystem
Some measures of support require little to no changes to current Public
Strategies or Law, while others might require a more complex and
comprehensive sequence of initiatives
Most the required measures are evident from weaknesses showed before, but
there others which benefit from a more explicit definition.
      1. Create a favorable fiscal regime to contributions, donations and other
         forms of support given by organizations;
      2. Adopt open standards and specifications not encumbered by patents
         or other restrictions to their study and use;
      3. Adopt procurement practices through multi-annual acquisitions, which
         include the costs of migration, archiving, training, certification and
         renewal of equipment;
      4. Enforce a practice of sharing and reuse of technological resources;
      5. Reject all the bids to Tenders which do not include the listing of all
         Open Source components;
      6. Prefer vendors whose contributions to the Open Source components
         used are shown to be more effective;
      7. Remove all legal barriers to anti-circumvention procedures and reject
         any vendor proposals that include them;
      8. Promote the creation of open access to all public administration data,
         by all citizens;
      9. Create a global and free privacy-preserving mechanism of secure
         authentication and signing to all European citizens, enterprises and
         organizations, shielded from manipulation from Governments and
         Private Enterprises;
      10. Create mechanisms for fiscal benefits to Private Sector organizations
          that follow Public Administration practices outlined above;
      11. Increase the EC OSPO budget, and allow it more influence on EU
          organizationsâ IT architecture, management and planning

      12. Increase the EC OSOR budget, and allow it to further extend its mission
          with partnerships in all EU countries, with grants and scholarships, and
          to include some of its metric in to the EUROSTAT system.

Conclusion
ESOP is deeply impressed with the work the European Commission has done
in the last decades supporting the Open Digital Ecosystem, but much more
has yet to be done, as the amount of suggestions in this Call for Evidence
demonstrates.

Only the empowerment of citizens is a guarantee of a long and lasting
strategy for an sovereign Europe, and we hope to have showed Open Source
can be a very useful tool in that regard.

As always, ESOP is available for further consultation and contributions that
the European Commission may deem necessary to request.
