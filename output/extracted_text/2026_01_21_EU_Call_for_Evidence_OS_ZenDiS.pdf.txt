EU Call for Evidence: European Open Digital Ecosystems

    â¢   What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are the
        main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure
        open source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

Europe is a major contributor to global open-source development, with around 30% of active
contributors on GitHub in 2021 based in Europe (Wachs et al., 2022). 1 This reflects strong
technological capacity in the EU. In recent years, the sector has also become more
professionalised, with more European companies building business models around open source
and offering off-the-shelf products and services. Moreover, many large European, including
German, companies such as Bosch and Mercedes-Benz have established dedicated Open Source
Program Offices (OSPOs). At the same time, the EU open-source ecosystem remains fragmented,
with many small and mid-size organisations and projects operating at national level. This
fragmentation makes it difficult to achieve scale and to compete with international hyperscalers.
Moreover, while Europe strongly promotes open code and open standards, there is in practice a
large number of standards, which limits interoperability.

On the adoption side (i), there is sometimes a lack of complementary services, e.g. integrated
cloud services comparable to those provided by major hyperscalers, which may make open-
source solutions less attractive for organisations seeking turnkey offerings. Moreover, users and
customers are often hesitant to change established products due to switching costs, reluctance
to opt for less-known solutions and perceived risks (e.g. compliance questions). Scaling up open-
source products to meet enterprise-level demand can also be challenging. Procurement practices
are another major barrier, as it is often unclear to organisations how to procure open-source
software, how to evaluate it fairly against proprietary solutions, or how to account for support
and additional services in procurement frameworks, particularly in a fragmented market. Open
source solutions may also lack functionalities of proprietary solutions and offer a less polished
user experience.

Barriers to sustainable contributions (ii) are closely linked to funding. Open-source software is
widely used across the economy and public sector, but its development and maintenance are
frequently underfunded. Many critical projects depend on a small number of maintainers and

volunteers, which creates long-term sustainability and security risks. This imbalance between
widespread use and limited financial support needs to be addressed through longer-term
investment and more systematic contributions from companies and public organisations that
rely on open-source software. Public spending could be a powerful lever to address this
imbalance, however, the vast majority of public IT expenditure currently flows into proprietary
solutions, depriving the open-source ecosystem of an important potential source of funding.
Without such sustained support, it is difficult to ensure the long-term quality and resilience of
open-source ecosystems in Europe. It should be noted that we have made important advances in
open source funding and procurement practices. For example, the German Sovereign Tech
Agency has shown how long-term funding in essential software components provides baseline
assurances that larger Enterprise Solutions and market-based approaches, like ZenDiSâs
openDesk, can rely on.

   â¢   What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
       provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in,
       security, innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added
       value.

Open-source software delivers clear added value for both the public and private sectors. By
enabling reuse, open source lowers total cost of ownership (over time) and avoids duplication of
development efforts. Public administrations can share and adapt solutions across institutions
and borders, while private companies can build on existing components to accelerate
development and market entry. Interoperability and open standards further lower barriers to
entry and support competition in the private sector.

Open source also reduces strategic risks by limiting dependence on single vendors, provided that
a robust ecosystem of IT providers and community support exists. Access to source code ensures
long-term control over digital systems and enables switching service providers if needed. Security
is strengthened through transparency, as open code allows independent review and faster
detection and remediation of vulnerabilities, which is particularly important in regulated and
sensitive sectors. Open source also contributes to more secure software supply chains, making it
easier to verify and track components across the development lifecycle. Open source further
enhances resilience by reducing exposure to external interference. At the EU level, it contributes
to digital sovereignty by decreasing one-sided technological dependencies and strengthening
long-term technological capacity.

   â¢   What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
       development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
       technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

The EU should focus on sustained investment, regulatory clarity, strategic procurement and
standard-setting â what we call: Invest, Buy, Clarify, Lead.
Invest: Long-term investment in the maintenance and development of critical open-source
components is essential, to ensure security and resilience but also to transform foundational
software into enterprise-ready âbuilding blocksâ that multiple operators can adopt and scale into
advanced services. By funding open source â and by earmarking dedicated resources in the
upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) â the EU can reduce structural fragility in
software supply chains and create a fertile ecosystem for innovation. Cascade funding, i.e. using
existing organisations like the newly established Digital Commons EDIC to distribute funding, can
reduce administrative hurdles.

Buy: The EU should leverage its own procurement power to drive adoption, establishing open
source as the default option wherever feasible, beginning with the European Commission and
extending to EU-funded projects. This creates more predictable demand and encourages
cooperative development across companies, plus it aligns with broader policy objectives of
interoperability and reduced vendor lock-in. Open source should continue to be treated as the
preferred solution in regulations, reinforcing its strategic role across public digital services and
enabling European operators to compete on a level playing field with global providers.

Clarify: Regulatory and legal clarity around developing, procuring and commercialising open-
source software is critical. Clear liability and compliance frameworks reduce uncertainty and thus
support both development and adoption. This is especially important when turning software into
widely usable modules that meet enterprise and compliance needs. There is a need for clear
guidance on how open-source projects and products can meet compliance and documentation
requirements without undue burden.

Lead: The EU should continue to lead by example in defining standards and interoperability
profiles and promoting secure, transparent software supply chains. For example, the Cyber
Resilience Act demonstrates how the EU can mandate Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs),
treating them as lifecycle security assets anchored in international standards. Similar approaches
can be applied more broadly to open-source ecosystems. Initiatives such as the EU Cloud
Sovereignty Framework can help set de-facto standards for sovereign IT.

    â¢   What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

The EUâs open source strategy should focus on supporting a set of technological building blocks
(Fermigier, 2025).2 These include:

     â¢ Foundation layers like network infrastructure, compute, storage, and core internet
        standards and protocols

     â¢ Enabling capabilities such as identity and trust, cybersecurity, data and AI management,
        service operations, and software development frameworks

     â¢ Interaction and application layers including collaboration and communication tools, digital
2   https://euro-stack.com/blog/2025/5/tbb-for-open-internet-stack
       market services, and domain-specific applications

By supporting development of these building blocks as open source components with common
standards and interoperability profiles, the EU can ensure they work together and are reusable
across sectors. At the same time, attention must go beyond code. To increase usability of open
source solutions, we need a modular approach to packaging, selling and delivering services that
covers deployment, integration, maintenance and support.

   â¢   In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
       competitiveness and cyberresilience?

Open source has the potential to enhance competitiveness and cyber resilience across virtually
all sectors. However, to maximise impact and reduce systemic risks, critical sectors should be
prioritised, including government, essential infrastructure, finance, research, and defense.
Focusing on these areas ensures that open source delivers the greatest strategic benefit while
laying a foundation for wider adoption across the economy.
