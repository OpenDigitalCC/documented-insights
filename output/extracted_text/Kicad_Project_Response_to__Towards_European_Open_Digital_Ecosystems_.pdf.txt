Kicad Project Response to âTowards
European Open Digital Ecosystemsâ
Introduction
KiCad is a European-born, open-source electronic design automation (EDA) suite used
by more than 200,000 weekly users in the EU. We welcome the Commission's
consultation and offer this response based on three decades of experience developing
and distributing critical engineering software as a public good.
This response addresses the Commission's five consultation questions directly.

Question 1: Strengths, Weaknesses and Barriers
Strengths. Europe hosts one of the world's largest open-source developer communities
[1]. The 2021 Fraunhofer study found that EU companies invested approximately â¬1
billion in open-source software in 2018, generating an estimated â¬65â95 billion impact
on EU GDPâa cost-benefit ratio exceeding 1:4 [2]. Open-source projects like KiCad
demonstrate that European institutions can incubate globally competitive tools. The
transparent, collaborative development model aligns with European values of openness
and produces software that users can use, audit, modify, and host locally.
Weaknesses. Much of the economic value generated by European open-source
contributors is captured outside the EU, primarily by large technology firms that
integrate community-developed code into proprietary products and services [3].
European open-source companies and foundations struggle to scale because they lack
access to growth capital, and because public procurement opportunities are structurally
biased toward incumbent vendors [3]. Encouraging vendors to identify and support their
open source supply and dependency chains in public procurement calls would
fundamentally alter the landscape of support for open source projects. Where larger
companies rely on the free work of open source, that reliance should be championed
and supported not just by supporting open source companies but by requiring traditional
companies that use open source to price in support of their toolchains during bids for
public contracts.
Barriers to adoption and maintenance. Public procurement processes often default
to proprietary solutions due to risk perception and the convenience of bundled
commercial support. Open-source alternatives face high entry barriers even when they
offer lower total cost of ownership and greater flexibility [3]. At KiCad, we see this
regularly. One way to approach this perception is to publicly call out open source
alternatives in CfPs as acceptable choices alongside their commercial counterparts.
Barriers to systematic contribution. Regulation designed for commercial software
vendors can impose disproportionate burdens on volunteer-maintained projects. The
Cyber Resilience Act's original drafts would have treated unpaid maintainers of
widely-used libraries as "manufacturers" subject to compliance obligations they cannot
realistically meet [4]. While later revisions addressed some concerns [4], the pattern
illustrates a systemic problem: legislation drafted without open-source input tends to
assume a vendor-driven model and inadvertently penalizes community development.
KiCad's development model illustrates this tension. We release frequent updates
containing both new features and bug fixes. Users upgrade at no cost and with no loss
of functionality, so the barrier to receiving security patches is minimal. Regulations
requiring long-term version-based support that are designed to pressure commercial
vendors into maintaining products they would prefer to abandon conflict with this
continuous-release model. When every release is free and upgrades are simple,
mandating multi-year support for old versions creates compliance overhead without
improving security outcomes. The regulatory intent is sound, but the mechanism
assumes commercial software economics.

Question 2: Added Value of Open Source
Cost reduction. The Fraunhofer study found that public sector adoption of open-source
software reduces total cost of ownership by avoiding license fees, enabling competitive
service procurement, and, critically, eliminating vendor lock-in [2]. A 10% increase in EU
open-source contributions would generate an estimated 0.4â0.6% annual GDP growth
and create over 600 new technology startups per year [6].
Vendor independence. Proprietary software creates dependency on a single supplier's
pricing decisions, product roadmap, and continued operation. Open-source software
can be maintained, forked, or transferred to alternative service providers if
circumstances change. For KiCad's over 200,000 weekly EU users, this means their
PCB designs remain accessible regardless of any single company's business decisions.
Many KiCad users will make copies of their KiCad software and archive it with individual
projects, ensuring future availability. This process is unimaginable with proprietary
software and facilitates long term support of hardware products at reasonable cost.
Customized solutions. Businesses that use open source software can modify the
software to meet their specific needs. Rather than attempting to fit their needs into the
existing proprietary offerings, open source software allows businesses to hire labor
locally to make specific changes to existing software, developing value both for the
specific business and for the wider EU community. This is particularly relevant as
modifications made by EU-based businesses are more likely to address concerns that
are specific to the EU and are less likely to be supported by foreign proprietary software
vendors.
Security through transparency. Open source software can be and frequently is
audited by any interested party. Not just company internal audits. Vulnerabilities
discovered in open-source components can be patched by the community and deployed
immediately, without waiting for a vendor's release schedule. The Commission has
recognized that open-source technologies "enable greater control over digital
infrastructure" and "support cybersecurity vulnerability management" [3]. The
EU-FOSSA program demonstrated this value by funding security audits of widely-used
open-source tools [7]. In the case of KiCad, visibility into the hardware design level
ensures a silicon-to-bits reliability, allowing KiCad users to protect their proprietary
designs without needing to engage in legal action to discover how proprietary software
behavior may leak designs (intentionally or unintentionally).
Innovation speed. Startups and small/medium enterprises (SMEs) use open source
software to build complex products without reinventing basic capabilities. Companies
that rely on open source can focus their efforts on building the best widget or service
without needing to re-invent the wheel to support it. Open-source software constitutes
70â90% of code in typical applications [8], meaning that European startups depend on
this shared infrastructure. A European electronics company can design
professional-quality circuit boards using KiCad rather than paying substantial license
fees for commercial EDA tools, directing those resources toward product differentiation
instead.
Concrete example. KiCad enables European engineers, researchers, and small
companies to design printed circuit boards using software they can inspect, modify, and
redistribute. CERN contributed to KiCad's development and remains a significant user.
The tool competes globally with commercial products costing thousands of euros per
seat. Without KiCad, many small European hardware companies and research
institutions would face a choice between expensive foreign software or inferior
capabilities.

Question 3: Recommended EU Actions
Include open-source stakeholders in regulatory development. The CRA and AI Act
both required substantial revision after open-source communities identified unworkable
provisions [4][9]. Formalizing consultation with open-source foundations and project
maintainers during the drafting process would produce better-calibrated rules from the
start. Compliance obligations should target commercial deployers who profit from
integrating open-source components, not volunteer maintainers who publish code as a
public good [4].
Distinguish development models in regulatory design. Regulation should account
for different software distribution models. Version-based support mandates make sense
for commercial products sold under restrictive licenses. They create perverse incentives
for continuously-updated open-source projects distributed at no cost, where the simplest
path to security is upgrading to the current release.
Reform procurement to remove bias against open-source solutions. Public
procurement should evaluate open-source options on equal terms with proprietary
alternatives. Additionally, all procurement agencies should require open source
disclosure and funding plans. When vendors use open source software as part of their
bid, they should both be required to disclose this usage as well as provide a planned
funding for the respective open source projects as part of their bids. A public good
without public support cannot survive. This requires adjusting tender requirements to
force the provision of a percentage of funding to the projects needed to make the
proposal viable in the first place.
Fund open-source infrastructure and maintenance. Research grants have
supported open-source development through programs like Horizon 2020 and Next
Generation Internet, but these mechanisms are time-limited and do not address
long-term maintenance and scaling [3]. The Commission should establish mechanisms
similar to Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund [7]. These provide sustained funding for
critical open-source projects, security audits, and infrastructure services
(European-hosted repositories, package registries, continuous integration platforms).
Support open-source foundations as institutional partners. Open-source
foundations provide governance, legal, and infrastructure services that enable
sustainable project development. EU funding programs should recognize foundations as
eligible recipients and partners, not merely as aggregations of individual contributors.
Recognize open-source contributions as academic and professional output.
Contributions to widely used open-source projects should be recognized similarly to
publications, teaching materials, or infrastructure work in performance evaluations and
funding decisions.

Question 4: Priority Technology Areas
Electronic design automation. European hardware innovation depends on design
tools. KiCad provides a European-developed alternative to a commercial EDA software
landscape dominated by non-EU vendors. Investment in open EDA tools supports the
semiconductor and electronics manufacturing sectors identified in EU industrial
strategy[5].
Industrial applications. The Commission's consultation specifically mentions
automotive and manufacturing [3]. Open-source software-defined vehicle platforms and
industrial control systems support European competitiveness in these sectors. The EU
has already invested in open hardware through RISC-V development and open
software-defined vehicle stacks under the Chips Joint Undertaking [3]. Extending this
investment to the rest of the stack would be a consistent choice.
The common factor across these areas is strategic autonomy. Technologies where
European users currently depend on foreign proprietary vendors represent both security
vulnerabilities and economic leakage. Open-source alternatives in these domains give
Europe control over critical infrastructure.
Question 5: Sectors for Increased Open-Source
Adoption
Electronics and semiconductor design. Europeâs push for semiconductor
sovereignty should include the design tools used to create both circuit boards and their
chips. KiCad demonstrates that open-source electronics design software can serve
professional engineering needs. Broader adoption in this sector reduces dependence
on foreign tool vendors and supports the full hardware development stack.
Education and research. Universities and research institutions benefit from software
they can study, modify and share with students. Open source tools also enable
reproducible research by allowing others to inspect and use the exact software used in
published work.
Critical infrastructure. Energy, transportation and telecommunications systems should
not depend on opaque foreign software. Open source components in these sectors
enable security auditing and reduce supply chain risks.
In each of these sectors, the value of open source derives from the same key ideas.
Transparency enables security verification. Independence from single vendors
eliminates lock in. And the ability to adapt software and hardware to European
standards without permission from foreign gatekeepers.

Conclusion
Open source software is infrastructure. It requires sustained investment and
appropriate regulatory frameworks that account for its unique characteristics. The
Commission's consultation recognizes this reality.
KiCad's experience illustrates both the potential and the challenges. A
European-developed tool serves hundreds of thousands of users and competes globally
with commercial alternatives. It exists because of collaborative development and
institutional support, not venture capital or license revenue. It faces regulatory
uncertainty when rules designed for commercial software vendors apply to community
projects without adaptation.
The Commission can strengthen Europe's open-source ecosystem by including
open-source stakeholders in policy development, funding maintenance and
infrastructure alongside research, reforming procurement to enable fair competition, and
designing regulation that supports all development models. These actions would help
Europe capture more of the economic value its open-source contributors create and
reduce strategic dependence on foreign technology providers.
