I represent Zabbix SIA, a mid-size company from Latvia dedicated to development and
support of Free and Open Source Monitoring and Observability solution called Zabbix. I
personally was involved in Open Source for more than 30 years.

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is not a niche alternative, it is the foundation on
which nearly all modern software and major business are built.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-
source sector? What are the main barriers that hamper (i)
adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open
source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source
communities?
Strengths
   Open source fits EU priorities: digital sovereignty, privacy (GDPR), transparency, and
   citizen rights
   Strong tradition of collaborative research and standards bodies
   Major projects and well known vendors with EU origins: Linux kernel contributions, KDE,
   GNOME, MariaDB, Nextcloud, XWiki, Zabbix, and many others
   Research institutions contribute significantly

Weaknesses
   27 member states with different languages, procurement rules, and priorities
   No unified market for open-source services
   Fewer open-source companies scaling globally compared to US
   VC funding for open-source business models lags behind
   US companies offer higher compensation, pulling contributors away
   Brain drain in both development and open-source business expertise
   Critical reliance on US-controlled platforms (GitHub, npm, PyPI, cloud providers)
   Limited EU-based alternatives at scale

What is the added value of open source for the public and private
sectors? Please provide concrete examples, including the factors
(such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation, among others)
that are most important to assess the added value.
Added value for the public sector

Cost efficiency
   No licensing fees; budgets shift from vendors to customization and support
   Shared development costs across agencies and governments

Transparency and trust

   Auditable code builds public confidence, especially for voting systems, tax platforms, and
   identity services
   Easier compliance verification for security and accessibility standards

Sovereignty and control

   Reduces dependency on foreign vendors
   Data stays under government control; no forced cloud migrations or vendor lock-in

Interoperability

   Open standards ease data exchange between agencies
   Citizens aren't forced to use specific proprietary software

Sustainability

   Code survives vendor bankruptcy or product discontinuation
   Knowledge remains in-house rather than locked in contracts

Added value for the private sector

Speed and flexibility

   Build on existing components rather than starting from scratch
   Modify software to fit exact business needs

Talent and recruitment

   Developers prefer working with open-source stacks
   Public contributions serve as portfolio/reputation building

Security

   Many eyes reviewing code (though this requires active maintenance)
   Faster vulnerability disclosure and patching in well-maintained projects

Avoiding lock-in

   Switch providers or bring operations in-house without rewriting systems
   Negotiate from stronger position with service vendors

Innovation
   Access to cutting-edge technology (AI/ML frameworks, databases, cloud-native tools)
   Collaborate with competitors on shared infrastructure while competing on products

What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to
support the development and growth of the EU open-source
sector and contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and
cybersecurity agenda?
   Require public bodies to evaluate open-source alternatives and document rejection
   reasons ("comply or explain")
   Prohibit tender specifications that name proprietary products without allowing equivalents
   Reform evaluation criteria to include sovereignty, portability, and long-term maintainability
   in scoring
   Identify strategic open-source components and ensure EU maintenance capacity exists
   Create open-source competence centers at EU and member state levelSupport
   university programs that involve students in maintaining real projects
   Promote open standards and resist standards capture by proprietary interests
   Clarify that public sector employees can contribute to open-source projects

What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
These technology areas are critical priorities for open source adoption and development:

   Operating Systems (including mobile devices!) & Core Infrastructure
   Cryptography & Security Libraries
   Identity & Authentication
   Industrial Control Systems / OT Protocols
   Network Infrastructure
   Monitoring and Observability

In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to
increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
Open source delivers benefits across all sectors. However, the following should be prioritised
given their critical role in infrastructure, security, and economic competitiveness:

   Public Sector / Government
   Critical Infrastructure
   Healthcare
   Financial Services
   Defense / Aerospace
