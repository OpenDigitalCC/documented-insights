             Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems

Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source ecosystem

The European Union benefits from a large, technically sophisticated, and increasingly
institutionalised open-source ecosystem that spans individual developers, SMEs, scale-ups, large
enterprises, foundations, universities, public research organisations, and public administrations.
Open source is not a peripheral component of Europeâs digital landscape. Empirical evidence from
open-source security and software supply-chain studies consistently shows that approximately
seventy to ninety percent of modern software codebases rely on open-source components, often in
mission-critical roles. This reality underpins the Commissionâs correct framing of open source as
a strategic asset for technological sovereignty, competitiveness, cybersecurity, and resilience.

Open source derives much of its strategic value from its role in enabling open standards and
permissionless innovation. By removing access permissions imposed by proprietary gatekeepers,
it lowers barriers to entry, supports contestable markets, and allows European SMEs and scale-ups
to build, iterate, and scale without structural dependence on a small number of dominant platforms.
In this sense, open source functions not only as a sovereignty tool, but also as a market-entry
mechanism and a competition enabler within the Digital Single Market.

Beyond code production, the EU possesses several structural strengths that are particularly
conducive to open-source development. These include a strong public-sector awareness of the
strategic importance of open source, an advanced regulatory culture that prioritises trust, security,
privacy, accountability, and resilience, and a deep pool of technical talent supported by
universities, research laboratories, and engineering communities. The Union has also developed a
set of institutional mechanisms that directly support open-source adoption and security, including
initiatives focused on software assurance, licensing, cybersecurity coordination, and publicly
funded digital innovation. Together, these elements provide a solid normative and institutional
foundation for transparent, auditable, and interoperable digital systems.

These strengths are especially visible in the blockchain and distributed-ledger domain. Core
infrastructure layers, including cryptographic libraries, protocol clients, node software, developer
tooling, and middleware, are predominantly developed as open source. This has enabled the
emergence of a global commons of reusable building blocks, accelerated innovation cycles, and
cross-border interoperability by design. Blockchain ecosystems illustrate how open source can
function simultaneously as technical infrastructure, governance infrastructure, and an innovation
substrate shared across jurisdictions and sectors.

Despite these strengths, the EUâs weaknesses in open source are largely structural rather than
technical. High-quality research output and human capital do not consistently translate into
sustainable deployment, long-term maintenance, or economic value capture within the Union. A
recurring pattern can be observed across sectors: open-source projects are launched and developed
through time-limited public research or innovation grants, but once this funding ends, maintenance
capacity deteriorates, security updates and documentation become sporadic, governance structures
weaken, and adoption pathways into procurement or regulated markets fail to materialise. The
result is a broken lifecycle in which European innovation exists, but long-term stewardship and
scaling do not.

Fragmentation exacerbates these challenges. Divergent national procurement frameworks,
heterogeneous regulatory interpretations, fragmented capital markets, and uneven public-sector
adoption practices place EU-based open-source projects at a disadvantage relative to large non-
EU technology firms with greater scale, financial resources, and integrated market access. At the
same time, private-sector engagement in open-source maintenance and governance remains
comparatively weak in Europe. Empirical surveys consistently show that while most European
firms rely heavily on open-source software, only a minority contribute meaningfully to its upkeep.
This contrasts sharply with the United States, where open source is treated as a core
competitiveness lever and is systematically funded and staffed by major technology companies
because doing so is economically rational relative to proprietary in-house development.

This asymmetry has strategic consequences. While Europe generates a substantial share of high-
quality open-source innovation, economic value, operational leverage, and platform control are
frequently captured outside the EU through dominant hosting providers, repositories, cloud
integration layers, and downstream productisation. The challenge for EU policy is therefore not to
stimulate more open-source development per se, but to repair the structural conditions under which
existing innovation can be sustained, secured, and scaled within the Union.

Added value of open source for the public and private sectors

Open source delivers concrete and measurable value to both public and private sectors by
reshaping cost structures, governance models, and risk profiles across the full lifecycle of digital
systems. For public administrations, open-source adoption reduces vendor lock-in and dependency
risks, improves substitutability, and strengthens long-term control over critical infrastructure. It
enables independent verification of security properties and compliance-relevant behaviour, which
is particularly important for foundational public services that must remain trustworthy and
adaptable over extended time horizons.

These characteristics are especially relevant in regulated digital sectors, including financial
services, digital identity, and crypto-asset markets. In such contexts, open-source foundations can
support compliance by enabling traceable change management, independent audits, and
interoperability with global infrastructure. Rather than undermining regulatory objectives, open
source can reinforce them by shifting supervisory focus away from opaque proprietary
implementations and toward verifiable outcomes and risk controls.
The Linux Foundation Europe and Linux Foundation Research published the study Open Source
as Europeâs Strategic Advantage, based on a survey of 316 organisations and industry
representatives conducted in the first quarter of 2025. At the sectoral level, 58 percent of
respondents reported that open-source software is a key driver of innovation, while 54 percent
highlighted its role in improving interoperability and standards. Approximately half of respondents
also identified open source as contributing meaningfully to greater transparency, lower operating
costs, and improved collaboration across organisations.

The study also examined how frequently organisations experience specific benefits from using
open-source software. Respondents were asked to indicate whether these benefits arise often,
sometimes, rarely, or whether they were unable to assess them. The results show that a substantial
share of organisations report that open source often delivers tangible value, particularly by
increasing productivity, reducing vendor lock-in, lowering costs, and providing access to higher-
quality software.

In blockchain and distributed-ledger systems, open source is also a practical precondition for cross-
border interoperability. Open-by-default architectures allow multiple independent
implementations, transparent upgrade processes, and resilience through client diversity rather than
reliance on a single vendor or stack. This model aligns well with EU objectives related to resilience
and systemic risk reduction. Public-sector initiatives increasingly reflect this logic, particularly
where public digital infrastructure is designed to remain compatible with widely used public
permissionless ecosystems. Such compatibility allows public projects to leverage global developer
communities, security research, and innovation capacity while retaining public governance
objectives.

For the private sector, open source commoditises the base layer of technology and enables
competition and innovation at higher layers of the value chain. SMEs and start-ups benefit from
lower entry costs, improved interoperability, and access to high-quality software components
without negotiating access with platform gatekeepers. Empirical industry surveys support this
assessment. A majority of organisations report that open source contributes directly to innovation
capacity, interoperability, cost reduction, reduced lock-in risk, and access to better software.
Importantly, firms increasingly perceive open source not merely as a cost-saving measure, but as
a catalyst for innovation, differentiation, and long-term competitiveness.
Measures and actions at EU level to support growth and sustainability

EU policy must address the entire lifecycle of open source, from early development through long-
term maintenance, security hardening, deployment, and market integration. The principal
bottleneck is no longer the generation of new code, but the sustainable stewardship of software
that already underpins critical systems across the economy.

Security evidence strongly reinforces this diagnosis. Large-scale audits of commercial codebases
across industries consistently reveal a high prevalence of severe vulnerabilities, widespread
reliance on outdated components, and significant use of dependencies that are no longer actively
maintained. These findings point to systemic risk arising from under-resourced maintenance rather
than from malicious development. Policy responses should therefore prioritise maintenance
capacity, vulnerability management, secure-by-design practices, and supply-chain transparency
for widely used open-source components, including cryptographic libraries, protocol software, and
developer frameworks.

Funding architectures must evolve accordingly. One-off research grants are insufficient to support
the transition from innovation to sustainable deployment. Instead, multi-stage funding models are
needed that allow promising open-source projects to progress from research into production,
adoption, and long-term maintenance. Incremental continuation funding tied to clearly defined
milestones would help stabilise mature projects, while explicit funding for documentation, security
response, and governance would address some of the most persistent sustainability gaps.

At the same time, incentives between public funders and private users should be better aligned.
Matching-grant mechanisms can encourage industrial users to co-fund or directly contribute
engineering resources to the open-source projects on which they depend. Such arrangements help
ensure that critical dependencies are not maintained solely by fragile volunteer capacity and can
foster a culture of shared responsibility across ecosystems.

Legal clarity is equally important. The EU should provide explicit guidance distinguishing open-
source software development, publication, and maintenance from the provision of regulated
services. This distinction is particularly critical in areas such as blockchain infrastructure and
cryptographic tooling, where legal uncertainty can discourage EU-based maintainers and
middleware providers despite their purely technical role. Regulatory frameworks should remain
neutral with respect to development models and focus on outcomes and risk rather than licensing
form.

Public procurement practices should also be adapted to better reflect the value of open source.
Evaluations should take into account total cost of ownership, auditability, interoperability, and
resilience over the lifecycle of systems, rather than defaulting to proprietary solutions. Sustainable
governance structures, including foundations, service ecosystems, and public-private partnerships,
should be supported as vehicles for long-term stewardship.
Finally, open source must be recognised as a human-capital-intensive system. Talent attraction
and retention are therefore strategic policy concerns. Labour-market and migration policies should
be aligned with Europeâs technological priorities, particularly in light of shifting global dynamics
affecting technical migration. Universities, research institutions, and innovation hubs should be
more tightly integrated into this strategy, linking education, research, open-source communities,
and routes to market.

Priority technology areas

Priority should be given to open technologies that function as horizontal infrastructure across
sectors, create systemic lock-in risks if controlled by a small number of non-EU providers, and
underpin security, resilience, and interoperability. This includes internet technologies, cloud and
edge infrastructure, cybersecurity tooling, open hardware, and blockchain and distributed-ledger
technologies.

In the blockchain domain specifically, priority areas include open cryptographic libraries and
secure primitives, core protocol clients and node software, interoperability layers, identity and
verifiable-credential infrastructure, wallet software and secure key management, privacy-
preserving technologies, and compliance-adjacent tooling that enables deployment in regulated
environments without centralising control.

Blockchain systems illustrate particularly clearly why openness matters. Public permissionless
networks rely on multiple independent implementations to validate protocol rules, reducing
monoculture risk and increasing resilience through diversity. At the same time, modular open-
source frameworks enable sector-specific deployments while preserving shared, auditable
foundations that support interoperability and trust.

Competitiveness, resilience, and interoperability

Open-source adoption can materially enhance EU competitiveness and cyber resilience by
reducing dependency on proprietary stacks and enabling a broader ecosystem of SMEs to innovate
on shared infrastructure. Recent supply-chain incidents have demonstrated that opacity and
neglected dependencies act as systemic risk multipliers. Coordinated maintenance, transparent
upgrade pathways, and improved visibility into software dependencies should therefore be treated
as core policy objectives.

Interoperability must be approached as a first-order design principle rather than an afterthought.
EU measures should avoid unintentionally privileging closed or permissioned architectures where
public permissionless systems could meet policy objectives through open standards, risk-based
controls, and privacy-preserving mechanisms. In the blockchain context, this implies supporting
interfaces that integrate with EU digital building blocks, including identity frameworks, data
spaces, and public-sector interoperability layers, while remaining compatible with global public
ecosystems where innovation and security research are concentrated.
All of these objectives ultimately depend on the continued openness of the internet itself. Open,
uncensored access to the internet underpins competition, innovation, and fundamental freedoms,
and is essential to the functioning of the Digital Single Market. Unwarranted interference with
connectivity risks undermining both economic activity and societal trust in digital systems.

Concluding remarks

Open source is best understood as strategic digital infrastructure rather than merely a licensing
model. It shapes where technical capabilities accumulate, who controls upgrade and security
cycles, and whether digital ecosystems remain contestable over time. The Commissionâs initiative
is therefore well positioned to focus on governance, sustainability, maintenance capacity, and
market integration, particularly in domains such as blockchain where open protocols already
underpin both public and private innovation.

The EUâs opportunity lies in converting its strong open-source base into durable strategic
advantage by combining lifecycle funding and maintenance support, procurement and deployment
pathways, legal clarity and regulatory neutrality, and interoperability and standardisation aligned
with global public infrastructure. In doing so, the Union can strengthen competitiveness, resilience,
and digital sovereignty without creating closed silos, ensuring that European open-source
innovation can scale, sustain itself, and anchor value creation within Europe.
