    BSA CONTRIBUTION ON THE EUROPEAN OPEN
         DIGITAL ECOSYSTEMS STRATEGY
Response to the European Commissionâs Call for Evidence

The Business Software Alliance1 welcomes the opportunity to provide input to the European Commissionâs
Call for Evidence on the future European Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy.

BSA is the global trade association of the enterprise software industry, representing companies that are
leaders in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and other cutting-edge and breakthrough
technologies, including quantum computing. We operate in over 20 markets in the US, Europe, and Asia,
advocating for policies that build trust in technology so that every industry sector and the public can benefit
from innovation.

BSA supports the EUâs ambition to review its approach to open source by releasing a new Strategy, updating
the framework introduced by the EU Open Source Strategy 2020â2023. We strongly believe in the importance
of boosting the development and competitiveness of the EU open source sector, as well as in encouraging
open-source uptake by private and public users. We support the goals of strengthening the position of start-
ups in the innovation ecosystem and of pushing organizations to contribute to open-source development.
However, to meet these objectives, careful attention should be paid to the nature of open source, which
heavily relies on global cooperation and on the portability and reusability of software, and appropriate
consequences should be drawn.

BSAâs contribution on the European Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy

BSA calls for a balanced approach to the future strategy on EU open source, grounded in real-life examples
and aiming for efficiency. In this context, BSA recommends the following:

      âª   Aim for collaborative and interoperable innovation, without geographic restrictions that conflict
          with open source principles, as well as global cooperation to adopt best practices for open source

      âª   Expand the scope of the 2020-2023 Open Source Strategy while maintaining a form of
          technological neutrality that does not prioritize open-source solutions over proprietary software,
          but instead focuses on organizations leveraging the best available solutions

      âª   Integrate the OSI definition of open source, and support the ecosystem through targeted funding
          of open-source infrastructure

      âª   Engage in structured dialogue with global open source foundations and other stakeholders while
          strengthening existing initiatives, including cooperation with ENISA

      âª   Promote open source in strategically important technologies and across the digital stack, without
          focusing on specific applications, as well as developing strong public-private partnerships.

Open Source in the European Union: Powering Innovation, Collaboration, and Growth
High-quality, secure, and sustainable open source depends on collaborative and interoperable innovation,
without geographic restrictions that conflict with open source principles, as well as global cooperation to
develop and adopt best practices for open source.

Open-source ecosystems foster cooperation at scale, accelerate innovation, and enable the creation of new
businesses and services. The vast majority of software deployed today already relies on open-source
components. By its very nature, open source is a borderless and collaborative model, enabling
community-driven quality assurance and interoperability across platforms and sectors. This ensures
portability and reusability of software, allowing algorithms and applications to be deployed seamlessly,
regardless of whether they originate from European or non-European providers.

The âopen source communityâ is large and diverse. It ranges from multinational, enterprise software
companies to individual volunteers. Community members include both those who develop and maintain
open-source software and those who consume open-source software, although in many instances,
community members develop, maintain, and consume open-source software all at once. Open-source
software projects may be funded, organized, governed, and sustained by organizations (e.g. governments,
multinational corporations, academic institutions, non-profits) or individuals (who themselves may be
affiliated with or supported by organizations).

Open source development takes place through a variety of models. In some cases, it emerges organically,
for example when projects are launched on open-source platforms, gain community traction, and gradually
evolve into widely adopted and strategically important software. More commonly, however, industry
participants of all sizes engage in open source by initiating or contributing to projects governed by established
open source foundations, such as the Linux Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, the Apache Software

                                                                                                               2

Foundation, and others. These foundations provide robust governance frameworks and play a critical role in
ensuring long-term maintenance, quality assurance, security, and sustainability of open source projects.

To foster the adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source, as well as to promote
sustainable contributions to open source communities, BSA suggests that the European Commission:
    â¢ promote innovation that is global, collaborative, and interoperable by design, and avoid geographic
       constraints or forms of lock-in that contradict the fundamental values of open source
    â¢ cooperate with public authorities around the world to develop and adopt best practices in open
       source.

Building European Open Source on a Decade of Innovation
The scope of the 2020-2023 Open Source Strategy should be expanded while maintaining technological
neutrality, integrating the OSI definition of open source, and supporting the ecosystem through targeted
funding of open source infrastructure.

In the European Union, open source has been a central driver of innovation over the past decade,
underpinning technological progress and entrepreneurial growth across industries. Europe hosts one of the
worldâs largest open-source foundations, the Eclipse Foundation, which includes several BSA members
among its contributors. Furthermore, Europeâs capital hosts every year the Free and Open Source Software
Developersâ European Meeting (FOSDEM), one of the most prominent open source conferences at the global
level, a landmark initiative which further illustrates both the vitality of the European open source community
and its global impact.

The EU Open Source Strategy 2020â2023 established a strong and comprehensive foundation for promoting
open source development and adoption across Europe. The core principles articulated in the 2020â2023
strategy remain sound and do not require revision. However, greater clarity is needed regarding the
definition of open source.

To that end, BSA suggests that the European Commission:
    â¢ build on its current achievements by extending the strategy beyond its previous scope in its future
        Open Digital Ecosystems strategy
    â¢ maintain a neutral approach that promotes the best-fit solution and does not prioritize open-
        source solutions over proprietary software (or vice-versa).
    â¢ explicitly adopt the Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition as its reference point, so as to avoid
        confusion with alternative software models and licensing approaches that do not align with open
        source principles
    â¢ fund open source infrastructure and the broader OS ecosystem, as suggested by the EU Sovereign
        Tech Fund.

                                                                                                            3

Strengthening Europeâs Digital Autonomy Through Open Source
A structured dialogue with global open source foundations and other stakeholders is essential to support
EU policy objectives in the future Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy. Existing initiatives, including
cooperation with ENISA, should also be strengthened.

Open source is a foundational element for effectively promoting Europe's technological leadership. The
openness and freedom of choice it provides are essential to ensuring long-term autonomy and resilience in
digital infrastructures.

Open-source software enhances competitiveness by providing organization choice, control and
interoperability, as well as enabling users to retain long-term autonomy over their technology decisions.
Reference and compatibility implementations in open source reduce costs and development efforts by
making high-quality software broadly accessible. This is particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized
enterprises in Europe, which can more easily leverage open source to access, adopt, and actively contribute
to innovation.

More broadly, open source lowers barriers for researchers, developers, public authorities, and businesses
alike, facilitating the development of algorithms, the simulation of complex systems, including quantum
systems, and the execution of advanced experiments.

As an example, cybersecurity has been a sustained and central focus of open source development. A
notable example is the Linux Foundationâs OpenSSF initiative, which addresses software security across the
open-source ecosystem and ensures continuous attention to security best practices throughout the
software lifecycle. The European Commission and ENISA are already engaged with these efforts, and this
cooperation could be further strengthened.

BSA suggests that the European Commission:
   â¢ establish a coordinated and structured dialogue with leading global open source foundations
       and other stakeholders and organizations that host and govern open source projects. Such
       engagement would help build mutual awareness and understanding of EU policy objectives and
       identify practical ways to reflect and support these objectives within global open-source ecosystems
   â¢ look into how to strengthen existing initiatives (such as cooperation with ENISA) for the
       development of an effective strategy on open digital ecosystems
   â¢ participate actively in the open-source software projects that develop or maintain software of
       particular value or interest to their government agency missions.

Unlocking Europeâs Digital Competitiveness Through Open Source
Open source should be promoted across the digital stack, adopted in strategically important technologies,
and be at the center of strong public-private partnerships.

For more than fifteen years, open source has been a major driver of innovation across a wide range of sectors.
Open source already plays a significant role in the deployment of software across Europe, and its importance

                                                                                                            4

can only be expected to grow further, extending across all sectors of the economy. Against this background,
it is neither practical nor desirable to single out individual sectors for special treatment, or to focus
excessively on open-source applications which can be commercialized; doing so may even prove
counterproductive. Instead, a broad, cross-sectoral approach to supporting open source adoption and
development should be pursued.

It should be noted that industry contributes the majority of expertise and resources to open source
development. Without the active involvement of skilled software developers from industry, a
comprehensive and effective open source strategy cannot succeed.

Given the strategic importance of digitalization as a central pillar of Europeâs competitiveness, BSA suggests
that the European Commission:
    â¢ encourage open source anywhere in the stack, instead of focusing on specific applications, while
        maintaining a framework that allows proprietary and open-source layers to interoperate
        seamlessly, ensuring users can leverage the specific strengths of each
    â¢ support the adoption of open-source approaches for technology areas of strategic importance
        to the EU, in close collaboration with industry
    â¢ cooperate closely with industry, fostering public-private partnerships with developers and
        consumers of open-source software.
