  Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems
     A â¿» Plurality Framework Perspective by the RadicalxChange Foundation Network

Open Source as the necessary first step towards achieving European
Digital Sovereignty
We welcome the Commission's initiative to develop a strategic approach to open source. Our
response draws on the â¿» Plurality Matrix framework from "The â¿» Plural European Way" paper,
which will be published in February/March. The paper aims to show how European values (EU
Commission (2022)) can be operationalised across three dimensionsâtechnical, economic, and
socialâthrough foundational properties (as directly enforceable rights) that give rise to emergent
properties (desirable outcomes). Within this framework, we argue that open-sourcing code is only
the first step within the technical dimension toward the goal of European Digital Sovereignty.

Looking at the technical dimension, we also need to establish other foundational properties.

In the economic dimension, we must establish âPlural funding mechanismsâ, including a greater
âNon-extractive value distributionâ to develop and maintain open source code and âSustainable
fundingâ. While many open source projects lack funding, digital platforms often exploit them for
their own financial benefit.

In the social dimension, we want to highlight the foundational properties of âParticipatory
decision-makingâ, guided by the governance principle of subsidiarity to ensure decisions are taken
at the most local, effective level possible, and accompanied by âCommunity-based moderation
and deliberationâ. That means equitably including all stakeholder communities in
decision-making, including minorities and underrepresented groups. In the social dimension, the
ultimate goal is digital âAgencyâ for the communities of users, builders, and creators. This
includes the âRight to exit and to forkâ. We believe these foundational properties are currently
missing from the operationalisation of open source software, including in EU programs that
support its development.

*Open source is a first foundational technical property enabling emergent outcomes across all dimensions.

Responses to Consultation Questions
1. Strengths, Weaknesses, and Barriers
Strengths: Europe possesses one of the world's largest open source developer communities,
whose work aligns naturally with the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles.

Weaknesses and Barriers: Open source is a necessary but insufficient condition to create
ecosystems that sustain and produce services open to all. The critical gap is that open source
code addresses only the first property of our matrixâs technical dimension. In fact, large parts of
centralised platforms and big tech run on open source code, yet still create unfavourable
conditions for users that do not adhere to European values. They can be technically open yet
economically extractive (value captured by large platforms) or socially centralised (governance
controlled by single entities). Current barriers to entry for open source development include
limited access to funding and infrastructure to operationalise open source code; extractive
business models by dominant players that create lock-in effects and monopolise network effects;
and a lack of sustainable community governance due to insufficient support frameworks.

2. The Added Value of Open Source
The value of open source must be understood through the lens of foundational versus emergent
properties. Emergent properties cannot be reliably achieved by directly pursuing them.
Attempting to mandate "sovereignty" or "resilience" without laying the proper foundations
creates systems vulnerable to capture and results in dependencies.

So how should open source be operationalised?

We acknowledge the potential of enabling European Protocol ecosystems, manifested by
community-led specifications across multiple builds, as an evolution from centralised single-build
proprietary platforms.

âOpen source codeâ, combined with the use of âInteroperable open standardsâ and
âDecentralised architecturesâ defined by a community of builders, creators, and users, lays the
foundation for the emergent property of âComposabilityâ. Composability fosters cooperation by
enabling the use of other protocolsâ work without permission. This form of cooperation enables a
different kind and degree of innovation in the operationalisation of open source software.

We see this in the Ethereum ecosystem, where each protocol builds on the work of others,
enabling very small teams to be highly impactful compared with traditional software
development. In some cases, open source protocols achieved similar outcomes with a few
hundred employees as traditional companies with tens of thousands of employees. This is a
major strategic advantage of â¿» plural protocol ecosystems over proprietary single-company
platforms.

3. Recommended EU-Level Actions

We recommend applying the concept of ââ¿» Plural protocol ecosystemsâ by extending the open
source perspective across all three dimensions. As first steps, we recommend the following
actions across all three dimensions of our â¿» Plurality Matrix:

Technical:

    ââ Apply a Protocol assessment framework to assess technology providers and EU Digital
          Initiatives;
    ââ Require multiple independent implementations for critical protocols (e.g., energy, free
          speech, AI, civic tech);
    ââ Establish European hosting infrastructure (repositories, cloud platforms) for open-source
          protocols to reduce dependence on centralised, non-aligned infrastructure.

Economic:

    ââ Apply â¿» plural funding mechanisms (e.g., quadratic and retroactive funding, plural
          ownership) to EU grants programs.
    ââ Ensure value flows to contributors through a fair distribution of the network effects,
          especially for intermediaries.

Social:

    ââ Promote multi-stakeholder governance architecture;
    ââ Strengthen the European Digital Infrastructure Consortium model;
    ââ Adapt the SCE model to the requirements of open digital communities and ecosystems,
          similar to the LLC model.

4. Priority Technology Areas
Priority should be given to areas that are especially impactful and essential to democratic
processes, such as Artificial Intelligence, cloud infrastructure, social media and
communications, and civic technology that enable digital democracy and participatory
governance.

5. Sectors for Increased Competitiveness
Increased adoption of open-source, permissionless protocols would enhance cyber resilience in
public administration (digital public services following the Estonia/Ukraine models), financial
services (using interoperable open standards that reduce data aggregator lock-in and boost

competitiveness for smaller players), and healthcare (privacy-preserving data systems). In each
sector, the goal is not merely to adopt open-source code but to build truly ââ¿»Plural protocol
ecosystemsâ for its operationalisation. We encourage the following mindshifts: ecosystems over
unilaterally controlled champions, protocols over platforms, communities over corporations.

Conclusion
Open source is necessary but not sufficient. The EU's open-source strategy should be embedded
within a broader Plurality framework that addresses the technical, economic, and social
dimensions simultaneously. Based on that holistic view, our ââ¿» Plural protocol ecosystemsâ
framework should be developed to assess all protocols against our criteria. Regulatory actions
and grant programs should be guided by the results of those assessments. By that, Europe can
achieve the emergent outcomes it seeks: digital sovereignty, resilience, competitiveness, and the
operationalisation of European Values, expressed through genuine â¿» Plurality that embeds
European values by design.
