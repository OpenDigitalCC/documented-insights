Introduction
As a leading global community for Free and Open Source Geographic Information Systems, QGIS.org
welcomes the European Commissionâs Communication "Towards European Open Digital
Ecosystems" (Ares(2026)69111).

For over two decades, QGIS has served as a key component of Europe's spatial data infrastructure,
providing public authorities, SMEs, and researchers with a sovereign, interoperable, and
cost-effective alternative to proprietary software [0]. We endorse the Commissionâs focus on
cementing digital autonomy and open collaboration. Hence, we submit this evidence to emphasise
that a truly resilient European digital ecosystem requires sustained, systemic support for the
underlying open source communities that maintain it. By prioritising "Open Source First"
procurement and investing in the security and scalability of community-driven tools, the EU can
ensure that its geospatial future is built on transparent, democratic, and truly sustainable
foundations.

While open-source software is already widely used across European public administrations,
widespread usage alone does not guarantee its long-term sustainability. The reliability, security, and
strategic value of Digital Public Goods depend on continuous investment in maintenance,
governance, and community coordination. Without deliberate policy and procurement mechanisms
that distinguish between merely using open source and actively sustaining it, Europe risks building
critical digital services on infrastructures whose long-term resilience is underfunded.

Despite hosting several large open source geospatial communities (e.g. QGIS, Leaflet, Geoserver),
Europeâs institutional infrastructure is locked into a non-EU proprietary monopoly. ESRIâs dominance,
fueled by free academic licensing and restrictive public procurement, creates a "sovereignty gap"
where critical national data is managed via proprietary software. This concentration hinders
technological autonomy and captures economic value outside the Union. To meet the goals of
Ares(2026)69111, Europe must ensure its digital roadmap is dictated by public interest, not global
commercial providers.

About the QGIS.org Foundation
QGIS.org is the official legal entity and community-driven organisation that oversees the
development and maintenance of QGIS, the worldâs leading free and open source desktop
Geographic Information System (GIS). It serves as the formal hub for a global ecosystem of
developers, users, and organisations dedicated to democratising spatial data analysis. The
organisation is tasked with managing the project's infrastructure, securing financial sustainability
through sponsorships and donations, and ensuring that the software remains interoperable and
compliant with international standards. By fostering a transparent and meritocratic environment,
QGIS.org empowers individuals and public institutions alike to access professional-grade
geospatial tools without the barriers of proprietary licensing and vendor lock-in, thereby playing
a critical role in the global advancement of digital sovereignty and spatial science.

While QGIS boasts a global community of developers and users, the majority of its users and
founding members are located in Europe. (The members of the QGIS project steering
committee currently include representatives from Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Italy, and
France.)

QGIS is officially recognised as a Digital Public Good [1] by the Digital Public Goods Alliance
(DPGA), a status that highlights its critical role in promoting sustainable development and
providing equitable access to professional-grade geospatial technology worldwide.

Response to the call
1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are the
main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open
source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to openâsource communities?

1. Strengths and Weaknesses of the EU Open Source Sector

Strengths:

   ââ Strong Community Network: Europe hosts a dense network of QGIS Local
      User Groups that provide localised support, training, and coordination for
      public-sector projects. Of the over 30 national user groups, 19 are located in Europe
       (Denmark, UK England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, UK Scotland, UK Wales,
       Norway, France, Sweden, Romania, Spain, Netherlands, Slovakia, Austria, Albania,
       Northern Macedonia, Republic of Kosova).

   ââ Digital Sovereignty: QGIS provides an alternative to proprietary lock-in (e.g.,
      US quasi-monopolist ESRI Inc.), ensuring that European public data remains
      accessible and under the control of public authorities.

   ââ High Standards Compliance: QGIS is compliant with INSPIRE and OGC,
      hence providing a reliable and sovereign framework for interoperability across
      the Union.

   ââ Innovation Hub: QGISâs ability to achieve world-class technical breakthroughs is
       evident in the abundance of new tools and developments that rival proprietary
       software.
Weaknesses:

   ââ Fragmentation: Many of the works can be hyper-local or specialised, potentially
      leading to a "silo" effect.

   ââ Resource Asymmetry: Compared to large US-based proprietary firms like
      ESRI, QGIS operates with limited budgets, relying heavily on volunteer labour.

   ââ Perception Bias: In some conservative public administrations, there is still a
      persistent (though declining) misconception that "free" software like QGIS lacks
      professional support or security.

2. Barriers Hampering Adoption and Maintenance

(i) Adoption and Maintenance of High-Quality/Secure Software:

   ââ Procurement Hurdles: Traditional public procurement processes are often
      designed for "buying a product" rather than "supporting a community." This
      makes it difficult for agencies to fund the long-term maintenance of open source
      tools.

   ââ Liability and Compliance Concerns: New EU regulations, such as the Cyber
      Resilience Act (CRA), place strict security obligations on software. Open Source
      projects like QGIS with a limited budget and resources will struggle with the
      administrative and technical costs of demonstrating compliance.

   ââ Legacy Dependency: Many agencies are deeply integrated into proprietary
      ecosystems (e.g., ESRIâs ArcGIS), making the "switch" to QGIS appear costly in
      terms of data migration and staff retraining.

(ii) Barriers to Sustainable Contributions:

   ââ The "Free Rider" Problem: Many large organisations and government agencies
      (even within the EU) use QGIS extensively but do not contribute back (either
      financially, through code, documentation, etc).

   ââ Lack of Structural Funding: Funding is often project-based (e.g., "Add feature
      X"). There is very little funding available for "boring" but critical tasks like bug
      fixing, security auditing, and documentation.
   ââ Investment in Education: The substantial codebase of QGIS demands
      advanced programming expertise. Academic institutions and universities must
      therefore enhance their curricula to adequately train students, equipping them
      with the necessary skills to meet these evolving challenges.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security,
innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added value.

QGIS provides an application that delivers significant added value to both the public and
private sectors through its commitment to interoperability, digital sovereignty, and rapid
innovation. By eliminating traditional barriers such as high licensing costs and
proprietary lock-in, QGIS empowers organisations to build sovereign, transparent, and
democratic geospatial foundations.

Added Value for the Public Sector

For public authorities, open source GIS is a critical instrument for digital sovereignty
and interoperability.

   ââ Sovereign Infrastructure: By utilising open source tools like QGIS, public
      administrations ensure that their spatial data infrastructure remains under their
      control and transparent to the citizens they serve.

   ââ Cost Efficiency: Public entities can avoid high recurring licensing fees and
      vendor lock-in associated with proprietary software. Below are some examples of
      large public organisations using QGIS within their spatial data infrastructure to
      reduce/cut proprietary license costs:

          ââ National Land Survey of Finland

          ââ French Ministry of Ecology (MinistÃ¨re de la Transition Ã©cologique)

          ââ The City of Copenhagen and Frankfurt

          ââ The State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Vorarlberg

          ââ Defence: Swiss Army, Austrian Army
   ââ Interoperability: QGIS adheres to international open standards (e.g., OGC
      standards), enabling cross-border data exchange. This is vital for projects like the
      European Union's Interoperable Data Spaces [2], where environmental and
      geospatial data must flow freely between member states.

Added Value for the Private Sector

In the private sector, open source acts as an accelerator for innovation and a tool for
risk management.

   ââ Rapid Innovation: The collaborative nature of open source allows for the rapid
      integration of cutting-edge technologies. For instance, a recent initiative has
      focused on positioning QGIS as the perfect platform for implementing Digital
      Twin technology.

   ââ Customisation & Commercial Edge: Companies can build and automate their
      workflows.

   ââ Risk Mitigation: Open source development models allow for security and audit
      checks by the global community, reducing the risk of hidden vulnerabilities often
      found in closed-source proprietary software.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

To support the development of the EU open source sector and advance technological
sovereignty, concrete actions at the EU level must move beyond simple adoption toward
active support.

Drawing from the current European digital strategy and the specific needs of the QGIS
community, here are the most impactful measures that could be taken:

1. "Open Source First" in Public Procurement
The EU can mandate that for all geospatial and IT tenders, open source solutions like
QGIS must be given priority or at least evaluated on a level playing field with proprietary
software.

Several European countries already demonstrate how public policy can effectively
promote open source in the public sector. In the Netherlands, the âopen source unlessâ
policy makes open source the default for public administrations, requiring explicit
justification when proprietary solutions are selected. This approach reduces vendor
lock-in and normalises open source as a standard option in public procurement.

In Switzerland, the Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfilment of
Government Tasks (EMBAG) embeds openness and reusability directly into federal law
and mandates that software developed by public authorities be published and reused as
open source, unless overriding legal or security reasons apply. This creates clear,
enforceable expectations for public administrations and aligns procurement practices
with long-term objectives for digital sovereignty and sustainability.

   ââ Action: Implementing the Interoperable Europe Act to ensure that public
      administrations share and reuse open source solutions by default.

   ââ Impact: This breaks the vendor lock-in with non-European proprietary giants and
      keeps public funds within the European tech ecosystem.

2. Direct Funding for Critical Digital Infrastructure

Currently, most funding is project-based (e.g., "build this specific tool"). To ensure the
long-term security and resilience of Europeâs critical digital infrastructure, the EU should
establish a dedicated, recurring funding instrument to maintain open-source Digital
Public Goods, inspired by the German Sovereign Tech Fund. The German programme
has shown that targeted public investment in the maintenance and security of widely
used open-source infrastructure is both effective and strategically sound. While
research and innovation funding remain essential, it does not address the ongoing
sustainability needs of mature, mission-critical open-source projects.

A European-level fund should therefore focus on activities that are systematically
underfunded by market mechanisms, including long-term maintenance, vulnerability
management, testing infrastructure, documentation, governance, and compliance with
regulatory requirements such as the Cyber Resilience Act. Operating at EU level would
enable coordinated support across Member States, avoid duplication, and ensure
consistent security and quality standards for critical Digital Public Goods such as QGIS,
while strengthening open-source ecosystems rather than individual vendors.

   ââ Action: Establishing a European Open Source Fund that provides recurring
      grants to organisations like QGIS.org for security auditing, bug fixing, and
      infrastructure maintenance.

   ââ Impact: Ensures that the backbone of Europe's geospatial infrastructure is
      resilient, secure, and not reliant solely on volunteer labour.

3. Enabling Public-Sector Contributions to Open Source Projects

In addition to procurement and dedicated funding programmes, public administrations
should be explicitly enabled to financially support open source projects through
donations, sponsorships, or membership fees where these projects constitute critical
digital infrastructure. Today, budgetary and legal uncertainties in many Member States
make such contributions difficult, despite their clear public value.

Providing EU-level guidance that recognises such contributions as a legitimate form of
public investment would help reduce free-rider effects, strengthen long-term
maintenance and security, and ensure that public funds contribute directly to the
sustainability of Europeâs open digital ecosystems.

4. Cybersecurity and Compliance Support

New regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) place a heavy burden on
software developers.

   ââ Action: Creating a central EU Security Auditing Service specifically for open
      source projects. This service would perform penetration testing and vulnerability
      assessments for critical projects like QGIS at no cost to the community. If
      possible, this entity would also submit patches to projects.

   ââ Impact: Strengthens the EU's cybersecurity agenda by ensuring that open
      source tools used in critical infrastructure (like water management or energy
      grids) meet the highest security standards.
5. Sovereign Cloud and Interoperability Hubs

The EU can provide the physical and digital infrastructure needed for open source
collaboration.

   ââ Action: Hosting a European Open Source Code Repository (a sovereign
      alternative to GitHub) and providing high-performance computing (HPC)
      resources for projects requiring heavy data processing, such as processing EU
      Copernicus satellite data via QGIS.

   ââ Impact: Reduces dependency on US-based platforms for the development
      lifecycle of European software.

6. Bridge the Gap Between Academia and Open Source

The EU should establish a dedicated funding instrument (modeled after the success of
Horizon Europe) specifically designed to bridge the structural gap between academic
research and the operational maintenance of open source ecosystems. Currently,
high-level geospatial research produced in European universities often results in
innovative algorithms that remain "trapped" in academic papers or unmaintained
prototypes because there is no formal mechanism to fund their integration into core
projects like QGIS. By incentivizing "Research-to-Core" pipelines, the EU can ensure
that taxpayer-funded breakthroughs in fields like AI-driven remote sensing or climate
modeling are directly ported into professional-grade open source tools. This funding
would not only support the technical "refactoring" required for academic code to meet
enterprise standards but also foster a new generation of "Research Software
Engineers" who can maintain these strategic digital assets, ensuring that Europeâs
scientific excellence translates into immediate, sovereign technological utility for all
citizens.

   ââ Action: Establish a "Research-to-Core" (R2C) Funding Stream

   ââ Impact: Prevents the "loss" of high-level European innovations and
      breakthroughs
7. Grant Public Interest Status to Foundations

Currently, in most European countries, associations or foundations that run open source
projects are classified as commercial entities by tax authorities. Granting them public interest
status would exempt them from VAT and could enable tax deductions for donors and
subscribers. This would create a powerful incentive without requiring new administrative
processes.

Proposed criteria for eligibility include: (1) The open source project is certified as a free and
community-driven democratic project by a foundation. This foundation may be the same entity
as the Open Source Steward designated under the Cyber Resilience Act. (2) The open source
project is already recognised as a Digital Public Good (DPG).

   ââ Action: Grant public interest status to foundations and adapt State member
      regulations accordingly

   ââ Impact: Release 20% of funds usage efficiency and helps companies and public
      organisations to sustain open source projects

8. Ensure Equity in Public Bids Rules

Current public market rules are making open-source choices harder than buying proprietary
software. Beyond the cultural habit of buying goods and not understanding the rationales of
open-source, there are real incentives to not choose a full-service approach. Buying software
may be eligible for accounting depreciation, whereas when buying cars, using free software is
considered a pure service and is more constrained by budget policies.

   ââ Action: Contributing to open source projects should be eligible for accounting
      depreciation as regular software acquisition or development.

   ââ Impact: Public contracts will no longer be distorted by budget policies

9. Suggested Tender Criteria to Support Sustainable Open-Source
Ecosystems

Public procurement has a decisive influence on the long-term sustainability of European
open-source ecosystems. In the case of Digital Public Goods such as QGIS, tender
procedures should explicitly acknowledge that value is not created solely through the
delivery of software or services, but through continuous upstream collaboration, quality
assurance, and knowledge sharing. Procurement frameworks should therefore be
adapted to reflect the community-driven nature of open-source development.

Tenderers should be required to demonstrate that they are active and responsible
upstream contributors to the open-source projects on which their offer is based. This
may include contributions in the form of source code, testing, documentation,
translations, security fixes, or participation in the projectâs governance and community
processes. Such requirements help contracting authorities distinguish between
organisations that genuinely invest in the sustainability of open-source ecosystems and
those that merely reuse open-source software without contributing to its long-term
viability.

Where publicly funded developments, adaptations, or bug fixes are required to meet
specific operational needs, procurement contracts should include a default obligation
to contribute these improvements upstream to the relevant open-source project.
This ensures that enhancements financed by public funds remain part of the shared
European digital commons, reduces duplication of effort, and prevents fragmentation
into incompatible forks. Exceptions should only be permitted where upstream
contribution is demonstrably impossible due to legal, security, or regulatory constraints.

To make these principles operational, tender specifications and award criteria should
explicitly cover the following elements:

   ââ demonstrated upstream contribution activity and engagement with the relevant
      open-source community;

   ââ contractual commitments to upstream the results of publicly funded development
      work;

   ââ allocation of sufficient effort and budget to testing, quality assurance, and
      documentation, including automated tests and openly accessible technical and
      user documentation.â

In addition, tender specifications should explicitly require adequate investment in
testing, quality assurance, and documentation, alongside functional development.
Reliable automated testing, comprehensive technical documentation, and clear
user-facing documentation are essential for the secure and professional use of
open-source software in public administrations. However, these activities are often
underfunded in traditional project-based procurement despite being critical for long-term
maintainability, cybersecurity, and operational resilience.

Embedding these criteria into public procurement practices would align tendering
processes with the EUâs objectives on digital sovereignty, cybersecurity, and
sustainability. At the same time, it would ensure that public investment actively
strengthens European open-source communities and infrastructures, rather than
inadvertently encouraging short-term extraction or ecosystem fragmentation.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

In line with the strategic vision of the QGIS.org Foundation, the roadmap for the
coming years focuses on a clear division of labour: QGIS.org provides the secure,
stable core, while the global community and market demand drive innovation.

The Strategic Focus: Security and Maintenance

From QGIS.org's perspective, the primary technological priority is to provide a
"rock-solid" foundation. This means QGIS.org's direct efforts and core funding should be
prioritised toward:

   ââ Hardening Cybersecurity: Meeting the rigorous standards of the EU Cyber
      Resilience Act (CRA) by implementing automated vulnerability scanning, secure
      signing of releases, and robust Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management.

   ââ Infrastructure & Maintenance: Ensuring the long-term stability of the core API,
      refactoring legacy code for modern performance, and maintaining the continuous
      integration (CI) pipelines that allow for safe development.

   ââ Quality Assurance: Directing resources toward bug-fixing and the "boring" but
      vital work that ensures QGIS remains an enterprise-grade tool for critical public
      and private infrastructure.

Innovation: Driven by Community and Market Demand
In the QGIS ecosystem, innovation is decentralised. New tools, features, and
cutting-edge algorithms are not dictated by a central authority but emerge from user
needs and market demand.

To foster this without bloating the core foundation, the following mechanisms should be
prioritised:

1. Funding Awards and "Call for Proposals"

The EU should issue Funding Awards (grants) targeted at specific high-priority
technology areas and invite open source communities to submit proposals. US-based
organisations already have such initiatives for open source geospatial developers (see
for example: https://cesium.com/cesium-ecosystem-grants/).

2. Incentivising Community Efforts

QGIS.org provides a necessary structure for maintenance and governance of the QGIS
community.

   ââ Action: Creating a structured "Innovation Fund" that community members can
      tap into to move specialised academic research into the production environment.

   ââ Impact: Formal certification of "Digital Good" contributions would enable
      developers and companies to capitalise on their innovation and ensure project
      sustainability.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
competitiveness and cyber resilience?

By prioritising open source geospatial software, the EU can ensure that public and taxpayer
funds remain within the European economy to foster local innovation, rather than being
funnelled into the licensing revenue streams of US-based corporations like ESRI.
Below are some of the examples of how open source GIS in general and QGIS in particular can
help achieve that:

1. Public Administration and Municipal Government

The most immediate impact is seen in the public sector, where the use of taxpayer money must
be scrutinised for long-term value and sovereignty.

   ââ Economic Sovereignty: Shifting away from ESRI ArcGIS allows public authorities to
      redirect "dead" licensing costs toward hiring local European developers and SMEs.
      This transforms a passive expenditure into an active investment in the European labor
      market and high-tech skills.
   ââ Data Sovereignty: Public and sensitive cadastral data should not be locked into
      proprietary data formats that require a specific foreign vendor's permission to access.
      QGIS uses open standards, ensuring that European governments retain 100%
      ownership and control over their spatial data.
   ââ Cyber Resilience: closed-source "black box" software creates a dangerous
      dependency. With QGIS, the code is transparent and can be independently audited by
      European security agencies to meet the requirements of the Cyber Resilience Act
      (CRA).

2. Critical Infrastructure and Utilities (Energy/Water/Transport)

The management of Europeâs power grids, rail networks, and water supplies is a matter of
national security.

   ââ Strategic Autonomy: Using a US-based proprietary platform for critical infrastructure
      creates a "geopolitical kill-switch" risk. If trade relations change or a vendor's cloud
      service is compromised, Europeâs ability to manage its own utilities is at risk. QGIS
      provides a sovereign alternative that can be run entirely on-premise.
   ââ Innovation via Market Demand: Large European utilities (like Deutsche Bahn in
      Germany and EUROCONTROL) demonstrate that QGIS can handle enterprise-scale
      asset management. The innovation in these sectors is driven by the community and
      market demand, where specialised plugins are built by European engineering firms to
      solve local problems.

3. Environmental Monitoring and Climate Action

The EU Green Deal and the Copernicus program are central to Europeâs future.

   ââ Compliance with EUDR: QGIS is essential for EUDR compliance because it provides a
      cost-effective, open source platform for SMEs and authorities to map land-use polygons
      without relying on proprietary, non-European software.
   ââ Maximizing Taxpayer ROI: European taxpayers fund the billions spent on Copernicus
      satellites. It is contradictory to then require those same citizens and researchers to pay
      expensive licenses to foreign corporations just to analyse and view that data.
   ââ Resilience in Crisis: In disaster management (floods, wildfires), resilience depends on
      interoperability. QGIS (in conjunction with other open source GIS tools like PostGIS,
      GeoServer, Leaflet, etc) ensures that emergency responders across different EU
      member states can share data seamlessly without format compatibility issues.

4. Precision Agriculture and Forestry

   ââ Leveling the Playing Field: Small-scale European farmers and foresters should not be
      priced out of precision technology. Open source GIS democratises access to
      high-resolution mapping, allowing local agricultural cooperatives to build their own tools
      for yield optimisation and carbon sequestration monitoring.
   ââ Local SME Growth: Instead of a "one-size-fits-all" solution from a global monopoly,
      European SMEs can develop specialised QGIS plugins tailored to specific local soil
      conditions or EU-specific forestry regulations.
