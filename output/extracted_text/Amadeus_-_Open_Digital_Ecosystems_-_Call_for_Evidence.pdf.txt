            Call for Evidence on Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems.

Amadeus is driving the digitalization of the travel and transport industry â empowering customers
such as travel agencies, airline and rail operators, airports, ground handlers and hotels to make
travel work better. Amadeus operates globally in over 190 markets with its headquarters in Spain
and the main research and development (R&D) site in France. In 2024, Amadeus invested EUR 1,365
million (gross) in R&D - being among Europeâs top investors in software research and development.
Overall, Amadeus employs more than 22,000 people. Amadeus belongs to a small group of global
champions born out of cooperation by European entities. Amadeus welcomes the opportunity to
answer to this call.

Amadeus aims to leverage open source to avoid duplicating nonâdifferentiating technologies and
instead build shared, reusable components that benefit industry. By contributing to and shaping
strategically relevant projects, Amadeus strengthens interoperability, reduces vendor lockâin, and
fosters secure, highâquality digital infrastructure. The companyâs objective is to collaborate openly
with partners, academia, and major ecosystems to accelerate innovation while ensuring longâterm
sustainability of critical technologies. This approach enhances technical excellence, visibility, and
talent attraction within the broader open digital ecosystem.

We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the European Commissionâs ongoing call for
evidence on Open-Source Digital Ecosystems with the following remarks: 1

1. Strengths and weaknesses: Barriers to adoption, maintenance and sustainable
contributions.

The collaboration between academia and industry remains one of the core strengths of the
European open digital ecosystem. This cooperation is structurally embedded in European research
and innovation culture and supports rapid knowledge transfer, earlyâstage experimentation, and
the      emergence     of   highâquality    solutions   across   multiple   technological        domains.
Despite this, several challenges persist. Stakeholders increasingly report the presence of âfacade
open source,â where organisational structures appear open but in practice operate as closed
consortia. Fragmentation also remains an issue: a limited number of geographically concentrated
hubs leads to uneven representation across EU regions.

2. Added value for public and private sectors.

Open digital ecosystems deliver clear and measurable benefits for both public and private
organisations. Transparency and auditability enable users to inspect software components, align
with open standards and protocols, and replace elements when needed, thereby reducing vendor
lockâin and improving assurance for sensitive or largeâscale data environments. The modular,
composable nature of open solutionsâoften compared to âLEGOâlikeâ architecturesâallows
organisations to deploy only what is required, avoiding oversized licence bundles and lowering
total cost of ownership. Collaborative improvement further increases value: stakeholders can
understand internal mechanisms, propose enhancements, and influence roadmaps, benefits rarely
available in closed software models.

In the private sector, Perses - an Amadeus openâsource project - illustrates the impact of
EUâsupported efforts. Components of the Open Observability Platform within Perses are
designated as RESCUE deliverables and receive programme funding (RESCUE is a part of the IPCEI-
CIS initiative). Furthermore, the forthcoming openâsourcing of the AUD/unified descriptors
framework (a RESCUE commitment for this year) will standardise the modelling of multiâprovider
networks, automate securityâgoverned connectivity, and reduce dependency on proprietary
orchestrators. These EUâbacked initiatives provide a shared foundational layer for efficient
interâcompany cooperation by introducing common standards, interoperable architectures, and
effectively leveraging the strengths of openâsource.

3. EUâlevel measures to support growth, sovereignty and cybersecurity.

Openâsource governance. Establish an EU âOpen Governance Markâ defining clear criteriaâsuch
as OSIâapproved licences, open and published governance processes, transparency of roadmaps,
and responsible securityâdisclosure practicesâto counter âfacade OSâ and provide trustworthy
signals for adopters.

Talent pipelines and incentives. Encourage companies to partner with universities that have
strong talent pools to run project-based internships focused on solving real data or software
challenges. These internships can be cost neutral for companies, provide students with valuable
industrial experience, and create a pipeline for future recruitment. These measures would reduce
brain drain, reinforce maintainer ship capacity, and build a stable EU talent base.

Publicâprivate standardisation pilots. Scale proven inâhouse technologies into open standards
or openâsource projects through mechanisms such as EDICs or PPPs, aligning with IPCEI-CIS and
Digital Commons initiatives. The unified descriptors framework (AUD) constitutes a strong
candidate for such pilots.

Role of large players. Establish a âLarge Player OS Cohortâ for priority sectorsâcloud & telecom,
AI infrastructure, mobility & tourism, and critical infrastructure (energy, health, transport, security).

Participating organisations should commit to (i) upstream contribution targets and security/LTS
support windows, (ii) opening nonâdifferentiating modules, and (iii) coârunning EUâorchestrated
calls for action and fellowship programmes. This structured approach would create an animated
ecosystem with predictable governance and a durable maintainer pipeline.

Regarding the ongoing discussions about tech sovereignty in an open manner, open source can
contribute but does not solve all EU strategic dependencies and must be complemented by for
example open standards (which is different from open source), sustainable governance, and robust
European capabilities based on strong technology partnership to ensure access to the best
technology offerings.

4. Priority technology areas.

Sovereign cloud and network orchestration. Prioritise open orchestration layers that abstract
heterogeneous providers and enable multiâcloud portability, uniform security governance, and
reduced vendor lockâin. Frameworks such as AUD demonstrate how internally validated solutions
can evolve into EUâwide standards. This can be a significant contribution to facilitate European
capabilities as it will lower market entry barriers, while maintaining access to the best technologies.

AI platforms. Invest in EUâoperated, fully open platforms covering the endâtoâend AI lifecycle to
ensure transparency, auditability, and sovereignty in critical AI infrastructure.

Dataspaces. Support openâsource middleware enabling secure, federated data exchange.
Investments should focus on identity, policy enforcement, federated catalogues, and
highâthroughput secure transfer, enabling data spaces to serve as reliable sovereign channels for
AI systems and applications.

Largeâplayerâdriven standardisation pilots. Prioritise the conversion of nonâdifferentiating,
productionâproven technologies into shared openâsource standards. Unified descriptors (AUD)
provide a model that can be replicated across sectors.

5. Sectors where increased openâsource use enhances competitiveness and
resilience.

Cloud/telecom and networking. Adoption of open orchestration frameworks and observability
stacks can reduce switching costs and improve incident management. The RESCUE programme
illustrates how EU instruments can promote sovereign alternatives.

Tourism, mobility and other large transactionâintensive sectors. These sectors, which rely on
complex multiâprovider networks, would benefit from descriptorâbased standardisation (e.g. AUD)
enabling uniform security governance and operational scalability.

Public administration. Transparency, reliance on open protocols, and auditability of software
make system replacement feasible and reduce longâterm lockâin risks.

Critical infrastructure (energy, health, transport, security). Multiâactor cooperation enabled by
openâsource approaches allows responsibilities to be shared according to domain expertise,
improving resilience beyond what any single operator can ensure.
