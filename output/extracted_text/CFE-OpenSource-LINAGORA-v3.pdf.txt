             Contribution to the Call for Evidence:

       "Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems"
Submitted by: LINAGORA
Date: February 3, 2026

To the European Commission,
As a leading French open-source software publisher active for over 25 years,
LINAGORA welcomes this initiative. We have long championed a "3rd Digital Way",
an ethical, sovereign alternative to the American and Chinese oligopolies. With an
annual R&D investment of â¬3.5 million, a team of over 40 researchers, more than
100,000 users of our solutions, and an estimated economic impact exceeding â¬5
million, we are deeply committed to building a digital ecosystem that respects
European values.

Open-source software already underpins an estimated 70-90% of all code in the digital
economy. Yet a significant share of the economic value generated by European open-
source communities flows outside the EU. This contribution offers our feedback on the
questions raised in the call for evidence, drawing on our expertise in open-source AI,
collaborative tools, and digital sovereignty.

1. Strengths, Weaknesses, and Barriers of the EU Open-
Source Sector
Strengths
The European open-source sector is distinguished by its strong alignment with ethical
standards, data privacy (GDPR), and a vibrant community of developers. Europe
excels in producing "trustworthy AI," integrating symbolic reasoning with data-driven
approaches, as seen in research clusters like ANITI in Toulouse. The EU also benefits
from robust academic institutions and a regulatory framework that values transparency
and citizen rights.

Weaknesses & Barriers
The primary barrier to adoption is the dominance of non-European proprietary giants
(GAFAM), which creates significant vendor lock-in:
   â¢    Adoption: Public and private entities often perceive open source as lacking
        professional support, despite the existence of established players like
        LINAGORA providing Open Source Software Assurance (OSSA).
   â¢    Sustainable Contributions: A major hurdle is the funding gap for "Real Open
        Source" innovation. Unlike proprietary models funded by massive license
        fees, open-source relies on service revenues or public grants.
   â¢   Computing Resources: The lack of access to massive computing power
       (compared to US tech giants) hampers the maintenance of high-quality, large-
       scale open-source projects, particularly in AI.

2. Added Value of Open Source for Public and Private
Sectors
The added value of open source lies in Sovereignty, Transparency, Security, and
Innovation:
   â¢   Sovereignty & Lock-in Prevention: Open source prevents vendor lock-in,
       allowing organizations to retain control over their infrastructure. Our Twake
       Workplace, with over 100,000 users, offers a 100% libre alternative to
       Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, ensuring that European data remains
       under European jurisdiction.
   â¢   Security & Data Privacy: In the age of AI, data leakage is a critical risk.
       Proprietary models often act as "black boxes." In contrast, open-source
       solutions like our OpenRAG platform allow companies to deploy Generative
       AI using their own private data without it ever leaving their secure
       infrastructure.
   â¢   Accelerated Innovation: Open source accelerates innovation by allowing
       entities to build upon existing robust foundations rather than reinventing the
       wheel, reducing time-to-market and development costs.
   â¢   Interoperability: Open standards and protocols enable seamless integration
       between systems, avoiding fragmentation and fostering a collaborative digital
       ecosystem.

3. Priority Technology Areas
In alignment with the scope of this consultation, we identify the following priority areas:

3.1 Generative AI and Foundation Models (LLMs)
Control over the "intelligence" layer of the future internet is existential. If Europe relies
solely on foreign models (e.g., from OpenAI or Anthropic), we lose control over our
cultural representation and economic data.
   â¢   Open Source LLMs: We must support models like LUCIE (released January
       2025) and Luciole, trained on European supercomputers (Jean Zay) with full
       transparency.
   â¢   Voice Technologies: Voice is a primary interface. Technologies like LinTO
       provide sovereign speech-to-text alternatives to GAFAM APIs, critical for
       confidentiality in professional interactions.

3.2 Cloud and Edge Computing
European sovereignty requires control over cloud infrastructure. Open-source cloud
solutions enable organizations to deploy on sovereign infrastructure while maintaining
interoperability. Edge computing, essential for IoT and real-time applications, must
also be developed with open standards to prevent lock-in at the infrastructure level.

3.3 Cybersecurity Tools
Open-source cybersecurity tools offer full auditability, a critical requirement for critical
infrastructure. The ability to inspect and verify security mechanisms is essential for
building trust and ensuring resilience against state-sponsored threats.

3.4 Internet Technologies and Connected Devices
Open protocols for IoT and connected devices are essential to avoid fragmentation
and ensure security. European leadership in open standards for industrial IoT can
drive competitiveness while ensuring interoperability across the value chain.

3.5 Open Hardware
Hardware sovereignty complements software sovereignty. Supporting open hardware
initiatives (such as RISC-V architectures) reduces dependency on non-European chip
designs and enables full-stack auditability for sensitive applications.

4. Sectors for Increased Competitiveness and Cyber
Resilience
   â¢   Public Administration & Government: Increased use of open source
       guarantees transparent handling of citizen data. LINAGORA already equips
       the French Government, the European Commission, and the European
       Parliament with sovereign tools.
   â¢   Defense & Critical Infrastructure: These sectors cannot afford the risk of
       backdoors or data exfiltration present in closed-source foreign software. Fully
       auditable code is a cybersecurity necessity.
   â¢   Healthcare: Patient data sensitivity requires maximum control. Open-source
       health IT solutions enable compliance with GDPR while fostering innovation in
       medical AI.
   â¢   Education: We work with the educational community to align AI models to
       pedagogical needs. Open source allows for tools that protect student data,
       align with European curricula, and develop the next generation of open-
       source talent.

5. Strategic Recommendations for a Sovereign Open
Digital Ecosystem
Building on the analysis above, we propose concrete measures aligned with existing
EU initiatives including the Next Generation Internet programme, the Digital Commons
EDIC, and the forthcoming Cloud and AI Development Act:

5.1 Establish a European Sovereign Fund for Digital Commons
The long-term sustainability of open-source infrastructure requires dedicated, patient
capital that the market alone cannot provide. Critical digital commonsâthe
foundational software upon which our digital economy dependsâare chronically
underfunded despite being essential public goods.
   â¢   Action: Create a European Sovereign Investment Fund for Digital Commons,
       endowed with significant multi-annual resources (proposed: â¬1 billion over 5
       years), dedicated to:
          â Development of strategic open-source projects aligned with EU priorities
          â Long-term maintenance and security auditing of critical digital
          infrastructure
          â Support for open-source maintainers and contributor communities
          â Acquisition and open-sourcing of strategic software assets
   â¢   Governance: The fund should operate with transparent, community-informed
       governance involving open-source foundations, public administrations, and
       civil societyânot solely commercial interests.
   â¢   Goal: Ensure the perpetual availability, security, and European stewardship of
       digital commons that underpin our sovereignty, moving beyond project-based
       funding cycles toward sustainable ecosystem investment for the common
       good.

5.2 Adopt the OSI Definition as the EU Regulatory Standard
The EU must officially adopt the Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition for "Open
Source AI" in all regulations, including AI Act implementation.
   â¢   Action: Funding and labelling must require release of model weights, training
       code, AND training data.
   â¢   Goal: Differentiate "Real Open Source" (like LUCIE) from "Open-Washing" by
       commercial actors.

5.3 Condition Public Funding on Full Reproducibility
Public money should fund public code. EU-funded AI projects (Horizon Europe,
Digital Europe) must guarantee full reproducibility.
   â¢   Action: Beneficiaries must publish datasets and data filtering pipelines under
       open licenses.
   â¢   Goal: Create a shared European "Data Commons" lowering barriers for
       SMEs and startups.

5.4 Implement a "Buy European & Open" Procurement Quota
The public sector must become the primary client for sovereign tech to create a
sustainable market.
   â¢   Action: Mandate that 25% (minimal) of public IT procurement be allocated to
       certified European open-source solutions.
   â¢   Goal: Reduce dependency on non-EU proprietary giants and fund EU
       ecosystem maintenance.
5.5 Prioritize EuroHPC Access for Fully Open Models
Computing power is the scarcity of the 21st century.
   â¢   Action: Grant priority access to EuroHPC supercomputers (Jean Zay, LUMI)
       to projects releasing models and data under open licenses.
   â¢   Goal: Ensure European tax-funded infrastructure benefits the community, not
       closed proprietary experimentation.

5.6 Mandate "Sovereign RAG" Architectures for Sensitive Data
For critical sectors (Health, Defense, Government), sending data to external APIs must
be prohibited.
   â¢   Action: Promote OpenRAG architectures where inference runs locally or on
       sovereign cloud infrastructure.
   â¢   Goal: Guarantee cyber resilience and data confidentiality.

5.7 Invest in Open-Source Skills Development
A thriving ecosystem requires skilled contributors.
   â¢   Action: Fund open-source curricula in universities and vocational training
       programs.
   â¢   Goal: Build the next generation of European open-source talent and reduce
       skills gaps.

5.8 Promote Open Standards and Interoperability
Interoperability prevents fragmentation and enables a collaborative ecosystem.
   â¢   Action: Mandate open data formats and federated protocols in public sector
       IT.
   â¢   Goal: Enable seamless integration across European systems and avoid
       proprietary lock-in.

5.9 Leverage the AI Office
The AI Office must actively protect European interests by promoting these fully open
local players.
   â¢   Action: the AI Office should certify and support models that offer full
       transparency, distinguishing them from "open-washing" marketing tactics
       used by foreign tech giants.
   â¢   Goal: Support the European AI open ecosystem and protect European
       citizens.

Conclusion
Europe cannot compete with the US or China by copying their proprietary models with
less funding. Our path to competitiveness lies in radical openness : pooling resources,
data, and intelligence to create shared infrastructure that no single company could
build alone.
These proposals align with the Commission's vision as expressed in this call for
evidence and complement existing initiatives including the Next Generation Internet
programme and the Digital Commons EDIC.
LINAGORA is ready to lead this charge toward a "3rd Digital Way" for Europe.
LINAGORA remains at the disposal of the Commission to further discuss how "Real
Open Source" can serve as the backbone of Europe's digital future.
