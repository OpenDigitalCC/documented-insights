This contribution is made in the name of Vates. We have already participated
in the answers and documents as part of other established industry groups.
However, we thought it necessary to highlight some specific aspects of
business models found and operated in the Open Source ecosystem. Therefore
this contribution focuses on structural aspects of the European open source
ecosystem that are critical for its long-term sustainability, competitiveness,
and contribution to Europeâs digital sovereignty.

1. Structural imbalance in prevailing open source business
models

A significant share of the European open source ecosystem currently relies on
service-based business models (support, consulting, custom development).
While these models are legitimate and play a major role, their predominance
also reflects a structural constraint: establishing and scaling a product-oriented
open source software vendor in Europe remains comparatively difficult.

As a result, European actors often generate substantial upstream value â
including software development, long-term maintenance, security updates, and
ecosystem stewardship â while downstream economic value is frequently
captured by larger entities with greater scale, capital, or market access. This
dynamic risks weakening the economic sustainability of key open source
components that underpin Europeâs digital infrastructure.

Recognising this structural imbalance is an important prerequisite for
strengthening open digital ecosystems in Europe.

2. Recognition of non-service and hybrid open source
business models

Open source sustainability should not be implicitly equated with service
provision alone. A resilient and competitive ecosystem depends on the
coexistence of diverse business models, including hybrid approaches such as
dual licensing, open-source-based SaaS offerings, certified distributions, and
reseller or partner-based models.

These models:

- Enable predictable revenue streams to support long-term maintenance and
security

- Facilitate sustained upstream investment

- Reduce dependency on continuous service expansion

- Allow European vendors to remain competitive while preserving openness

- Hence, support European economic security and strategic autonomy

EU policy initiatives should explicitly recognise and value this diversity of open
source business models as a core element of a healthy and innovative digital
ecosystem.

3. Public procurement adapted to open source value
chains and supply-chain realities

Current public procurement practices often favour large system integrators or
intermediaries that aggregate and package open source technologies into
higher-level offerings. While integrators play a legitimate role, this can
unintentionally obscure the structure and value of the underlying open source
supply chain.

In practice, high-value digital services â such as cloud-native platforms,
Kubernetes management solutions, or AI/LLM-based services â are frequently
procured without adequate visibility into the foundational open source
components on which they depend (e.g. operating systems, Kubernetes
distributions, virtualization, storage, and infrastructure management software).
These components are sometimes treated as âfreeâ, despite requiring sustained
investment in development, maintenance, and security, often provided by
European vendors and communities.

This lack of transparency creates several risks:

- Under-recognition of upstream value, weakening the sustainability of critical
software components

- Distorted competition, where economic value is disproportionately captured
at the integration layer

- Reduced resilience, as public buyers may underestimate dependencies and
long-term maintenance needs

We therefore recommend that EU public procurement frameworks be adapted
to:

- Better reflect the full open source value chain in integrated digital offerings

- Enable and encourage direct procurement from open source software
vendors where appropriate

- Recognise software stewardship, upstream contribution, and long-term
maintenance as procurement-relevant criteria

- Avoid procurement structures that systematically reinforce gatekeeping roles
at the expense of upstream sustainability

Such adaptations would support fair and contestable competition, strengthen
resilience, and align procurement practices with Europeâs strategic autonomy
objectives.

4. Strengthening resilience and sustainability of European
open digital ecosystems
For European open digital ecosystems to remain resilient, innovative, and
sovereign, policy approaches should move beyond a narrow focus on service-
based models or downstream integration. Explicit recognition of value creation
across the full open source stack â from foundational infrastructure to higher-
level services â is essential.

Supporting economically sustainable open source software vendors is not only
a market issue, but also a matter of cybersecurity, resilience, and long-term
digital capacity for Europe.
