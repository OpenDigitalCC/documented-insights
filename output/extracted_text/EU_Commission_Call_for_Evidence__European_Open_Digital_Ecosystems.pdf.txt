EU Commission Call for Evidence: European Open Digital
Ecosystems
Centre for Net Zero Response

Introduction

Centre for Net Zero welcomes the European Commissionâs initiative to develop a strategy for
European Open Digital Ecosystems. We strongly support the Commissionâs ambition to
strengthen Europeâs competitiveness, resilience and technological sovereignty through
open, interoperable and trustworthy digital infrastructure.

About Centre for Net Zero

Centre for Net Zero is a non-profit, open energy research institute, established by the
Octopus Energy Group. We operate autonomously and set our own research agenda.

We are building a global evidence base on demand flexibility â showing how and when
energy can shift in response to system needs. Using insights from our trials and system
modelling, we demonstrate how mobilising flexibility at scale can displace fossil fuels - and
what happens when demand is an active part of the system. We share our work openly,
supporting governments, policy-makers and grid operators.

Executive Summary

Energy is a flagship sector for European Open Digital Ecosystems. Europeâs energy system is
already highly digitalised, yet progress in deploying AI and advanced digital tools remains
constrained by fragmented data access, limited interoperability, and fragile digital
foundations. Open-source software, open standards and open data approaches are
therefore foundational infrastructure for Europeâs energy transition, and offer an opportunity
for Europe to develop sovereign, domain-specific AI.

To support open, collaborative and competitive digital ecosystems in energy, the
Commissionâs strategy should:

   1.â Establish dedicated, multi-year funding mechanisms for open-source communities
       and critical digital components;â

   2.â Embed open data and open-source requirements in public procurement and funded
       projects;â

   3.â Support the development and adoption of trust and assurance frameworks already
       emerging from open initiatives; andâ

   4.â Build on existing open-source and synthetic data initiatives when developing new
       data infrastructures, rather than starting from scratch.

                                                                                                     1
Responses to Consultation Questions

1. The strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source energy sector

Within the energy sector, the EU benefits from a strong foundation of open research,
engineering expertise and standards-led collaboration. Transmission and distribution system
operators, research institutions and technology providers have a tradition of cooperating on
protocols, modelling and market design, creating favourable conditions for open solutions
that support interoperability, transparency and system-wide optimisation.

Europe has established enabling organisations such as Linux Foundation Energy and
Cresym, which provide neutral governance, technical stewardship and credibility for
emerging open-source initiatives, with active participation from the private sector.

Alongside this, Europe has a growing network of open-source-oriented start-ups and
research-driven organisations in the energy domain, underpinned by a strong culture of
openness and collaboration. While this environment supports innovation, many such
organisations face challenges in scaling and developing sustainable business models while
remaining open, particularly when operating in regulated energy markets.

Despite these strengths, the open-source ecosystem supporting energy digitalisation
remains structurally fragile. Many high-value tools and datasets emerge from time-limited
research or innovation programmes, but lack sustained funding for operational maintenance,
cybersecurity, documentation and governance. As AI and digital tools move from pilots into
operational use, this gap between innovation and long-term stewardship becomes a material
risk.

Barriers to adoption and maintenance are especially acute because energy is both highly
regulated and operationally critical. Network operators and market bodies require clear
assurances on cybersecurity, data protection, provenance and liability, yet many
community-led projects lack the resources to provide formal governance, software
supply-chain transparency and structured vulnerability management. Integration with legacy
grid and market systems further requires specialist skills and flexible funding that are often
difficult to secure within regulated entitiesâ innovation and procurement frameworks.

Distribution system operators (DSOs) are typically less well represented in open source
initiatives than transmission operators. This reflects more constrained resources and
innovation capacity amongst DSOs, despite being among those that could benefit most from
shared digital tools. Targeted EU-level support, through bodies such as e.DSO and the DSO
entity, could help address this imbalance and ensure that open-source energy infrastructure
reflects whole-system needs.

Finally, sustainable contribution to open-source energy projects is constrained by weak
incentives for large system participants to contribute back, limited professional recognition
for maintenance and stewardship work, and regulatory uncertainty around data access and
AI deployment. Together, these factors slow the maturation and operational readiness of
open solutions precisely where they could deliver the greatest system-level value.

                                                                                                2
2. The value of open source for the energy sector

Open source offers clear and distinctive value for energy systems as they transition towards
greater digitalisation, decentralisation and automation using AI. By enabling transparent and
interoperable digital infrastructure, open-source approaches reduce vendor lock-in and
allow system operators, regulators and market participants to retain strategic control over
critical functions. This is particularly important in energy, where infrastructure lifetimes are
long and switching costs can become prohibitive.

Europeâs energy system is already highly digitalised by global standards, with widespread
smart metering, liberalised markets, high renewable penetration and growing electrification
of transport and heat. This creates a strong foundation for AI deployment. However, uptake
of AI in energy remains limited, not because of a lack of use cases or technical capability,
but because access to high-quality, usable data remains the primary bottleneck.

Open-source tools and datasets also accelerate innovation by allowing a wider range of
actors to participate in developing and validating solutions. In the context of AI for energy,
access to data is the primary constraint on progress, including for developing a Foundation
Model for energy. Energy consumption, network and market data are often sensitive,
personal or commercially confidential, limiting their use in research and innovation.
Privacy-preserving approaches such as synthetic data, developed and shared through open
ecosystems, enable realistic testing and model development without exposing underlying
data. In this context, the Data Union Strategyâs support for synthetic data represents a
strategically important intervention.

3. Actions to support the development and growth of the EU open-source sector

At EU level, the most impactful actions would address the specific structural barriers facing
open-source energy solutions. First, there is a clear need for dedicated, multi-year funding
mechanisms that support the maintenance and security of critical open-source components
used in energy systems, essential for operational deployment but poorly supported by
existing funding mechanisms.

Public procurement and funding for energy digitalisation should more explicitly require open
standards, interoperable architectures and open-source implementations. Procurement
frameworks should enable system operators and public bodies to contract for long-term
support and maintenance of open solutions.

The EU should support the development of trust and assurance frameworks tailored to
energy applications. Work is already underway to develop evaluation frameworks for
open-source AI-generated and AI-ready grid data in the energy sector through OpenSynth,
our open collaborative initiative with the Linux Foundation Energy. This, and initiatives like
these, provide not only technical assets, but also practical experience in aligning on
interoperability, data quality and model evaluation â insights that can directly inform
EU-level standards, certification schemes and guidance.

                                                                                                 3
The EU should recognise privacy-preserving data infrastructure as a core enabler of open
energy innovation. The Data Union Strategy and emerging work on synthetic data and
data-sharing frameworks is particularly welcome. Recent Commission announcements
represent a significant shift in emphasis: away from building more data infrastructure, and
towards improving data accessibility, quality and usability. Rather than creating new
structures for the proposed synthetic data factories announced in the Data Union Strategy,
the EU should explicitly build on existing open initiatives. Supporting and scaling open
ecosystems would allow Europe to move faster than closed or bespoke consortia, developed
primarily for the purpose of satisfying funding calls, while retaining strategic control.

Finally, open-source and synthetic data approaches should be recognised as mutually
reinforcing. Open digital ecosystems enable rapid iteration, peer review and reuse, while
synthetic data expands the pool of actors who can participate safely and legally. Together,
they offer a pathway for Europe to develop and deploy high-quality, domain-specific AI for
energy at scale â turning data from a constraint into a strategic asset, and strengthening
both competitiveness and cyber resilience.

4. Priority technology areas

Energy systems are a priority sector where increased use of open source can deliver
substantial gains in competitiveness, resilience and affordability. The energy transition
depends on coordination across millions of devices, actors and data sources, which cannot
be efficiently delivered through closed, siloed digital systems. Open-source approaches
support interoperability across the Single Market, enable innovation by a broad ecosystem
of suppliers, and reduce strategic dependency on a small number of proprietary platforms.

Within energy, priority should be given to open-source technologies that underpin
system-wide coordination and trust. These include interoperability standards; data exchange
across networks, markets and devices; and privacy-preserving data infrastructure that
enables AI development without compromising data protection.

Open evaluation and benchmarking frameworks for AI and synthetic data are also a priority,
as they provide the transparency and comparability needed for regulatory confidence and
operational uptake. Finally, open tools supporting distributed and edge computing are
increasingly important as intelligence moves closer to assets such as homes, vehicles and
substations.

5. Open source for increased competitiveness and cyber resilience

In the energy sector, open source is a strategic enabler of both competitiveness and cyber
resilience. As energy systems become more digital and AI-driven, the underlying software,
data models and interfaces increasingly shape market structure, innovation and security
outcomes.

Open-source approaches lower barriers to entry by providing shared, interoperable digital
foundations. This reduces vendor lock-in, enables a wider range of suppliers to compete,

                                                                                              4
and supports faster diffusion of innovation across the Single Market â all of which are
critical for a system that relies on coordination across networks, markets and devices.

Open source also strengthens Europeâs position in developing domain-specific AI for energy.
It enables broad participation in model development and validation while reducing reliance
on a small number of global vendors. The case for open-source AI for energy is made
clearly in the Linux Foundation Energyâs policy paper from January 2025.

From a cyber resilience perspective, open source improves transparency, auditability and
shared vulnerability management in critical infrastructure. When supported by appropriate
governance and maintenance, open digital ecosystems align innovation, security and system
resilience, delivering a clear strategic advantage for Europeâs energy transition.

Conclusion

Centre for Net Zero strongly supports the Commissionâs ambition to develop European Open
Digital Ecosystems. For energy, openness is not a secondary design choice but a
prerequisite for deploying AI and digital technologies safely, competitively and at scale.

Europe already possesses many of the necessary foundations: a highly digitalised energy
system, strong open research communities, emerging trust and assurance frameworks, and
a growing policy focus on data accessibility through initiatives such as the Data Union
Strategy. The priority now is to move decisively from strategy to implementation.

By investing in the sustainability of open-source ecosystems, embedding openness in
procurement and funding, scaling privacy-preserving data approaches, and building on
existing open initiatives, the EU can turn data from a constraint into a strategic asset. In
doing so, Europe can strengthen competitiveness, enhance cyber resilience and accelerate
the delivery of an affordable, secure, decarbonised and digital energy system.
