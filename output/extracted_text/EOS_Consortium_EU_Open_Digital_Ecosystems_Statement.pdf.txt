Statement of the EOS Consortium
Call for Evidence: Towards European Open Digital Ecososystems

STATEMENT OF THE EOS CONSORTIUM
ON THE CALL FOR EVIDENCE
âTOWARDS EUROPEAN OPEN DIGITAL ECOSYSTEMSâ

Introduction â Who We Are and Why We Respond
The EOS Consortium (https://eos-consortium.com/) brings together a broad range of European
open source companies, that design, implement, operate, and maintain open source-based digital
solutions at scale. Our members include specialised SMEs, established mid-sized IT service
providers, open source product vendors, platform developers, and public-sector-focused
integrators, alongside contributors and maintainers of widely used European open source projects.

Through this diversity, the EOS Consortium represents a significant and operationally
representative part of the European open source industry. Our members are not primarily advocacy
organisations; they are delivery organisations. They work daily with public administrations, critical
infrastructure operators, and regulated industries across the European Union, translating open
source software into secure, reliable, and mission-critical digital services.

We therefore welcome the European Commissionâs Call for Evidence on âTowards European Open
Digital Ecosystemsâ. We particularly welcome the Commissionâs recognition that open source
software already forms the backbone of Europeâs digital infrastructure, while economic value
creation and strategic control often remain fragmented or located outside the Union.

Our contribution focuses deliberately on the economic and practical dimensions of open digital
ecosystems. We aim to complement existing policy-oriented perspectives with insights from those
who are responsible for implementation, long-term operation, security, and scaling of open source
solutions in real-world environments.

Open Source Is Already Critical â But the Market Model Is Incomplete
Across public administration, industry, healthcare, energy, and research, open source software
constitutes the majority of the digital stack. Estimates that 70â90% of modern software systems
rely on open source components align with our membersâ operational experience.

However, while open source is omnipresent, the economic structures supporting it remain
underdeveloped in Europe. Value is frequently extracted at the level of cloud platforms, proprietary
service layers, or non-European hyperscalers, while the upstream projects, integration work, and
operational expertise remain underfunded.

This creates three structural risks for Europe:

First, sustainability risk: critical components depend on voluntary or under-resourced maintenance.
Second, dependency risk: European administrations and companies rely on open source but lack
strong European suppliers capable of long-term operation and accountability.

Third, scale-up risk: promising European open source solutions struggle to transition from project-
based deployments to reusable, market-ready platforms.

The EOS Consortium strongly supports the Commissionâs assessment that research and innovation
funding alone cannot address these challenges. Open digital ecosystems require industrial policy
instruments that support the full lifecycle from development to market integration and long-term
operation.

From Principles to Market Mechanisms
The European debate on open source has been highly successful in establishing guiding principles
such as openness, interoperability, and reuse. These principles are widely shared across our
industry.

What is now required is a systematic shift from principles to market mechanisms.

Open source does not primarily compete on license costs. Instead, competition and value creation
occur in areas such as:
â secure and compliant operation,
â integration into complex legacy environments,
â guaranteed maintenance, quality assurance and update cycles,
â cybersecurity processes and incident response,
â interoperability across organisational and national boundaries,
â and professional support and training.

If European policy instruments focus only on licensing models or high-level openness requirements,
they risk missing where real economic and strategic value is created.

Procurement as a Strategic Lever
Public procurement is the single most powerful lever the European Union and its Member States
possess to strengthen open digital ecosystems.

From an industry perspective, procurement must evolve in four key ways.

First, the EU Commission should establish clear political framework conditions for the preferential
procurement of open source software and introduce a clear âopen source by defaultâ rule in
European public procurement law as part of the current public procurement review. This will
significantly stimulate the supply side and in turn will lead to more competition and more and
higher-quality software.

Second, procurement should purchase outcomes, not proprietary licenses. Tender documents
should focus on measurable requirements such as interoperability, portability, security processes,
and service levels, rather than on whether a solution is labelled âopen sourceâ or âproprietaryâ. The
results of publicly funded projects should be made available to others.
Third, procurement templates should explicitly reflect open source realities. Standard contractual
clauses for maintenance, security patching, upstream contribution, exit strategies, and vendor
transition would significantly reduce legal uncertainty and transaction costs for both contracting
authorities and suppliers.

Fourth, procurement structures should enable European SMEs and consortia to participate
effectively. Overly large, monolithic contracts often exclude the very companies that possess deep
open source expertise, while favouring large system integrators that treat open source as a
commodity input. The EU and its competent authorities should specifically design and promote
procurement processes in such a way that innovation, continuous development, and forward-
looking solutions are given greater priority than rigid and complete fulfillment of individual formal
tender requirements.

Sustainment: The Missing Middle Between Research and Market
One of the most critical gaps in current European funding structures is the lack of support for
sustainment.

Between early-stage research projects and fully commercial products lies a phase in which software
must be hardened, documented, secured, and operationalised. This includes activities such as
release engineering, security audits, compliance documentation, long-term maintenance planning,
and community governance.

These activities are essential for reliability and trust, yet they are rarely funded adequately. As a
result, Europe risks depending on software that is technically open but operationally fragile.

The EOS Consortium therefore strongly recommends the creation of European instruments
specifically dedicated to open source sustainment. Such instruments could include multi-year co-
funding for critical projects, match-funding schemes that reward private investment in
maintenance, and recognition of operational excellence as a funding criterion.

In addition, sustainability must be supported through procurement: Public administrations should
for example ensure that any software modifications made are also fed back upstream into the
original software project and that suppliers have the skills and invest into long term maintenance
and development of the open source software in questions, or â alternatively â have contracts with
vendors taking over this responsibility.

Scaling European Open Source Businesses
European open source companies face a structural disadvantage when scaling internationally.
Traditional growth capital models often do not align well with open source business models based
on services, subscriptions, support, or dual licensing.

As a result, many successful European open source projects are either acquired by non-European
actors or struggle to grow beyond a certain size.

To address this, the EU should:
â support scale-up instruments tailored to open source business models,
â facilitate access to growth capital that values long-term service revenue and ecosystem
development,
â and promote European reference deployments that demonstrate viability at scale.

Reference deployments in areas such as digital identity, data platforms, observability, form
management, or sovereign workplaces can create market pull and reduce adoption risk for both
public and private users.

Security, Compliance, and Trust as Industrial Capabilities
Open source is often associated with transparency and peer review. While these are important
advantages, security and compliance do not emerge automatically from openness.

In practice, security is the result of funded processes: secure build pipelines, software bill of
materials (SBOMs), vulnerability management, patch SLAs, and incident response procedures.

European policy should therefore treat security and compliance as industrial capabilities rather
than abstract attributes. Establishing common minimum requirements for open source security
processes in procurement and funding programmes would raise the overall maturity of the
ecosystem and reduce fragmentation across Member States.

Interoperability Must Become Verifiable
Interoperability is a cornerstone of open digital ecosystems, yet it is often defined in abstract terms.

From an implementation perspective, interoperability becomes effective only when it is testable and
verifiable. Open standards, reference implementations, and conformance test suites are essential
tools to reduce ambiguity and prevent lock-in through incompatible interpretations.

The EU can play a key role by supporting the development of such tools and by encouraging their
use in public procurement and cross-border projects.

European Delivery Capacity as Digital Sovereignty
Digital sovereignty should not be understood solely in terms of intellectual property or licensing. It
also depends on Europeâs ability to design, integrate, operate, and evolve digital systems
independently.

The EOS Consortium represents companies that provide exactly this delivery capacity.
Strengthening European open digital ecosystems therefore requires investment not only in software
artifacts, but also in skills, organisational maturity, and operational excellence.

Supporting European open source service providers strengthens resilience, reduces dependency
risks, and ensures that openness translates into real strategic autonomy. This can be achieved by
public contracting authorities giving greater weight to local supply capacities or by making local
capacities a binding requirement.

TOP 6 MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN EUROPEAN OPEN DIGITAL ECOSYSTEMS
1. Establish an open source by default policy. The standard case in procurement of IT solutions
should be that all software used is completely available under open source licenses accourding to
the OSI definition.
2. Shift funding from âbuildâ to âmaintain, run and improveâ
 Support sustainment, maintenance, and operational excellence alongside innovation.

3. Procurement that buys outcomes, not licenses
  Focus on interoperability, security, and service quality through standardised procurement clauses.
In addition, it should be ensured that the project results are made publicly available and shared with
relevant stakeholders in order to promote collaborative, efficient, and sustainable innovation
processes.

4. Scale-up instruments for open source business models
  Enable growth capital and market access tailored to service-based and open source-native models.

5. European delivery capacity as a pillar of digital sovereignty
  Invest in skills, operational maturity, and trusted European providers.

6. Make openness verifiable
 Support standards, reference implementations, and interoperability test suites.

Conclusion
The EOS Consortium strongly supports the European Commissionâs ambition to strengthen open
digital ecosystems. From an industry perspective, success will depend on aligning policy objectives
with economic and operational realities.

Open source is not only a technological choice; it is an industrial ecosystem. By focusing on
procurement, sustainment, scale-up, and delivery capacity, the European Union can ensure that
openness translates into resilience, competitiveness, and long-term value creation within Europe.
