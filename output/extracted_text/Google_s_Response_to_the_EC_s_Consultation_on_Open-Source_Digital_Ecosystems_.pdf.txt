      Googleâs response to the ECâs call for evidence on Open-Source Digital Ecosystems

Section I: Introduction and Executive Summary

Google welcomes the European Commissionâs (the Commission) initiative to strengthen the
European open-source digital ecosystem. We share the Commissionâs view that open-source
technologies are fundamental to technological sovereignty, competitiveness, and security.

Google is one of the worldâs leading contributors to open-source technologies. Google has
long supported open-source technology because it benefits the entire ecosystem, in particular
by accelerating technological innovation, fostering industry standardisation, and ensuring
security across critical software infrastructure.1

In 2024, approximately 10% of Alphabet's full-time workforce actively contributed to
open-source projects.2 Google has released more than 8000 open-source projects, features,
libraries, SDKs, datasets, sample code and more in the last 5 years alone.

From Kubernetes which standardised orchestration of cloud workloads for an open,
interoperable and multi-cloud infrastructure, to the Transformer architecture that laid the
foundation for the generative AI revolution, to the Android Open Source Project that
democratised mobile computing, Google has consistently released critical innovations to the
community. We summarise below the benefits of Googleâs open-source technologies and
projects to the European digital sector.

We believe the path to European digital sovereignty lies not in isolation or digital protectionism,
but in leveraging open, global technologies to build differentiated European value. This
response sets out how our open ecosystems - in Cloud, AI, Mobile, and Industrial Applications -
can and do function as enablers of European growth and independence, reducing
dependencies and preventing vendor lock-in.

Section II: Googleâs open-source approach enables multi-cloud strategy, which is an
important technical guarantee of cloud sovereignty

The Commission rightly seeks to address âdependenciesâ which risk lock-in within the EU digital
ecosystem. In the cloud sector, proprietary stacks that bind customers to a single vendorâs
infrastructure (by technical and/or commercial means) hinder the development and
competitiveness of the EU open-source sector.

Google developed Kubernetes - an open-source system to deploy, scale, and manage
containerised applications anywhere3 - and donated it to the Cloud Native Computing
Foundation (CNCF) in 2014 specifically to break the cycle of vendor lock-in.4 Before
Kubernetes, cloud providers offered proprietary orchestration tools that locked customers into

    their specific infrastructure. Kubernetes created a universal standard that allows European
    enterprises to "write once, run anywhere." It therefore enables a âtrueâ multi-cloud strategy,
    allowing workloads to move seamlessly between hyperscalers and European providers (e.g.,
    OVHcloud, IONOS and T-Systems) without code rewriting. True multi-cloud is the only
    technical guarantee of sovereignty and contestability. If a European company is unsatisfied
    with the offering of its existing cloud provider, Kubernetes allows it to migrate its workload to
    another cloud provider without rewriting its application.

    In addition, Google recognises the need identified by the Commission for operational
    sovereignty. Through partnerships with European leaders like Thales/S3NS (France), we offer
    "Sovereign Cloud" solutions which enable our European partners to hold the encryption keys
    and control data access.5 This ensures that European organisations retain full authority over
    their data while accessing world-class open infrastructure.

    That said, cloud sovereignty in the absence of free choice for end users will not eliminate
    lock-in. It is also critical to ensure that cloud providers compete on the merits, enable
    open-source and facilitate switching. Barriers to entry and expansion exist in the cloud market,
    but the primary barrier to cloud switching (including within the EU) is not technical, but
    contractual (in particular software licensing practices). Addressing restrictive licensing
    practices would benefit European customers and the economy as a whole by increasing
    contestability in the cloud market, enabling true multi-cloud and driving down prices, especially
    for public sector entities.

    These measures will therefore also play a key role in facilitating digital sovereignty - by
    ensuring customers have the free choice to switch to the cloud providers that best suit their
    digital sovereignty needs. European digital sovereignty is not a choice between innovation and
    control, but rather the convergence of the two.6 Maintaining an open and competitive
    European cloud market is essential to achieving this, specifically to:

            ââ Access the worldâs most advanced AI technologies.
            ââ Ensure strong cybersecurity and the resilience of the European digital economy against
               single points of failure.
            ââ Achieve sustainability through highly efficient hyperscale data centres.
            ââ Preserve strategic autonomy through clear, harmonised rules and cooperation.

    Section III: Googleâs open models and frameworks support European AI innovation

    AI offers a generational opportunity for European innovation. As a key provider of open models
    and frameworks, we believe that anyone should be able to quickly and easily turn their AI idea
    or innovation into reality.7 Open-source software has become increasingly important to this
    goal, heavily influencing the pace of innovation in AI and machine learning (ML) ecosystems.

Investments in open-source software are important because many AI technologies rely on
closed or exclusive approaches. This walled-garden approach creates high barriers to entry for
developers (including within the EU); limits efforts to make AI explainable, ethical, equitable; and
stunts innovation. Weâre committed to open ecosystems, as we firmly believe no one company
should own AI/ML innovation. Many large European companies (e.g. LVMH8, Zalando9 and
Mercedes-Benz10) have successfully adopted and adapted Google AI and used Google
infrastructure to innovate in their own businesses or increase productivity.

Googleâs contribution of the Transformer architecture in the paper âAttention is All You Needâ in
2017 - which introduced the "attention mechanism," allowing models to process data
sequences in parallel rather than sequentially - laid the foundation for the modern generative AI
industry.11 This foundational research underpins almost all large language models and
revolutionised the field of AI, enabling the rise of European champions like Mistral. We continue
this tradition with Gemma,12 our family of state-of-the-art open models, which provides
European developers with cutting edge capabilities without the need to train a model from
scratch. This lowers barriers to entry and allows for "sovereign" fine-tuning, where the model
runs locally on European infrastructure.

In addition, by open-sourcing Googleâs frameworks such as TensorFlow13 and JAX14 (along
with PyTorch), Google has ensured that AI development skills are portable and not tied to a
proprietary "black box" platform. By offering its TPUs via the cloud and supporting open chip
architectures (like RISC-V, which the Commission explicitly supports), Google is providing AI
developers and cloud customers more choice beyond Nvidiaâs leading GPUs for developing
and deploying AI models and applications, which enhances European resilience.

Finally, Google is committed to supporting the development of AI in a responsible manner.15
We advocate for a "spectrum of openness" that balances innovation with security. While
Google is committed to openness across the AI value chain, we believe that frontier models
with potentially dual-use capabilities require robust governance to prevent misuse. Our
approach supports the EUâs safety objectives while ensuring the developer ecosystem remains
vibrant.

In the "Connected Devices" and "Internet Technologies" sectors, Googleâs open-source
approach offers developers and consumers flexibility and choice. In particular, Android
provides a vital alternative to closed, proprietary platforms (such as Apple/iOS).

The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is free and open to anyone to download, modify,
and distribute.16 Through the AOSP, we enable hundreds of European manufacturers to build
modern devices free of charge and without having to develop an OS from scratch. In contrast
to a closed, proprietary ecosystem with tightly integrated hardware and software, open-source
Android provides developers with greater flexibility, lower barriers to entry, and a significantly
larger, more diverse potential user base. Further, Android's open nature enables deeper
customisation, specialised hardware support, and faster, more permissive app distribution. The
European tech champions Spotify and Klarna were built upon the reach of Android and the
scalability of Google Cloud.

As Googleâs Mobile Application Distribution Agreements are non-exclusive, original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Samsung are contractually free to pre-install rival
app stores (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Store) and rival assistants (e.g. Bixby) alongside Googleâs
services. This flexibility ensures that the mobile ecosystem remains competitive and diverse,
preventing the hardware-software lock-in characterising competitor platforms. The rapid
growth of competitor apps like ChatGPT and Spotify on Android proves that pre-installation
does not equal lock-in: users actively seek out and install competing services.

Furthermore, by open-sourcing the Chromium engine,17 we have lowered the technical barrier
to entry for browser vendors, allowing them to focus on privacy features or user interface (UI)
innovation rather than building a rendering engine from scratch. Chromium is the open-source
engine that powers not just Chrome, but also major competitors like Microsoft Edge, Opera,
Brave, and Amazon Silk. We also champion open web standards by leading the cross-company
initiative Project Fugu,18 which aims to empower web applications to compete directly with
native apps, reducing the gatekeeper power of app stores. This project empowers web
developers to create powerful Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) with features like local file
access, clipboard integration, and hardware interaction, all while maintaining security.

Section V: Android Automotive OS provides open-source industrial infrastructure for
European OEMs

Europeâs industrial strength, particularly in automotive, is a key asset. Google supports the
digitalisation of this sector through Android Automotive OS (AAOS).19 Unlike
phone-projection solutions, AAOS is a full open-source operating system that runs directly on
the vehicle and can be customised by European OEMs (e.g. Volvo, Renault and Polestar) to fit
their brand identity. This allows for a shared ecosystem of apps and services, reducing
development costs for European automakers. We have opened AAOS to third-party
developers for charging, parking, and navigation apps, ensuring the car becomes an open
platform for European digital services.

Section VI: Conclusion

Google contributes to the European digital ecosystem. Our open-source investments and
dedicated European cloud products provide the sovereign infrastructure necessary to
support European innovation, as evident from the examples above of European tech
companies that have built their success on Googleâs open tools. We would welcome the
opportunity to work with the Commission to further strengthen this ecosystem, ensuring that
openness remains the driver of Europeâs competitiveness and technological independence.
