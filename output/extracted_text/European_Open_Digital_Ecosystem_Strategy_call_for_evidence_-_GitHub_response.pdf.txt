GitHub Contribution to the Call for Evidence: Towards
European Open Digital Ecosystems
GitHub welcomes the opportunity to present evidence to the upcoming European Open
Digital Ecosystem strategy. As the home of open source software development, GitHub is
committed to the advancement of open source and shares the European Commissionâs
assessment that open source is a crucial contributor to the EUâs competitiveness,
cybersecurity and digital sovereignty.

The first chapter of this submission provides evidence of open sourceâs contribution to
European policy goals and examines the arguments laid out in the call for evidence. Drawing
from GitHub user numbers, which we publicly share as open data in the GitHub Innovation
Graph,1 we provide quantitative insights into the size and strength of the European open
source ecosystem. The second chapter makes practical recommendations for policy and
funding initiatives that the European Commission should consider including in its strategy.

    I. The Value of Open Source to the EU
The EU is a global open source powerhouse. As of the end of 2025, 24.9 million EU software
developers and 1.3 million EU organizations are active on GitHub, contributing to a total of
54 million EU-based software projects. The EU ranks second globally in total number of
developers on GitHub, behind the USA at 30 million and ahead of India at 24.5 million. When
it comes to contributions to open source software development, the EU takes the lead: Over
the course of 2025, European developers made more than 155 million individual code
contributions to public software projects on GitHub, ahead of the US at just below 140
million and India at just below 118 million.

This enormous productivity of EU open source software developers translates to tangible
economic growth. A 2021 study for the European Commission found that open source
software contributed a minimum of â¬65 to 95 billion to EU GDP.2 The global demand-side
value of open source software is estimated at $8.8 trillion.3 In addition to its direct economic
contribution, open source software developers themselves are a highly qualified, skilled
demographic. A survey of more than 500 open source maintainers conducted by the

German governmentâs Sovereign Tech Agency4 found that more than half of respondents
had 15 years or more of professional experience in software engineering. Investing in an
attractive, supportive environment for the open source community thus has indirect positive
economic effects as well, by attracting global talent.

1. Pillars of a Successful Open Source Industrial Policy
GitHub shares the analysis presented in the Call for Evidence that the EU should go beyond
its successful past initiatives to promote open source software in the context of research
and innovation programs. While projects such as Next Generation Internet are very popular
and have had a tangible positive effect on the open source community, the research and
innovation framework has its limits: Research and innovation policy typically supports the
development of new features, the adoption of new technologies or new experimental
approaches. Large parts of the open source infrastructure that European businesses rely on
are mature and require steady maintenance and hardening against cybersecurity risks
rather than innovation. Funding open source maintenance is more akin to the maintenance
of physical infrastructure, such as maintaining roads or bridges. 5 Such infrastructure
investment should become an integral part of the EUâs industrial policy, rather than being
limited to research and innovation programs (see Recommendation 1).

A successful open source industrial policy should not restrict itself to promoting the
commercialization of open source software. While commercialization is an attractive and
realistic goal for some projects, as shown by the large number of successful open source
businesses, it is inappropriate for others. Requiring a commercialization strategy from an
open source project as a precondition for being considered in the context of the European
Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy would be a mistake and a lost opportunity. It is important
to distinguish between open source products, which are easier to monetize, and open
source components, which make significant contributions to the European economy by
forming basic building blocks of EU companiesâ technology stacks, without lending
themselves to commercialization. Typical examples of open source products include
operating systems or cloud-based end-user applications that offer opportunities for
businesses to offer related commercial services, hosting or service contracts. Typical
examples of open source components include programming languages or libraries.
Crucially, virtually every open source product that has the potential for commercialization
also relies on a number of open source components (the same is true for proprietary

software products). Failing to support those components limits the success of any open
source industrial policy that seeks to increase the competitiveness of its businesses.

One example of an open source component that has benefited greatly from the strategic
investment of the German governmentâs Sovereign Tech Agency 6 is the programming
language Rust, stewarded by the Rust Foundation. Rust is a memory-safe programming
language, which means that it is designed to automatically prevent a whole class of
dangerous errors in software, which could otherwise lead to crashes, data loss, or security
vulnerabilities. GitHub Innovation Graph data shows that since its inception in 2012, Rust
has grown steadily in popularity and now occupies rank 17 of the most popular programming
languages in the EU. Unlike some other programming languages, Rust is not closely
associated with a single industrial sector, but it is widely used across diverse sectors that
require a high level of cybersecurity. While the Call for Evidence is correct in pointing out
that some industrial sectors, such as the automotive industry, benefit particularly strongly
from open source software collaboration7, the example of Rust shows that an open source
industrial policy must not think in silos. Many foundational technologies, such as Rust,
make enormous contributions to the EU economy, but would risk falling through the cracks
of an open source industrial strategy that focused only on commercialization of open source
products or close links to individual industrial sectors (see Recommendation 1).

2. What Makes Open Source European?
It is important to stress that software development is a collaborative, globally connected
endeavor. GitHub Innovation Graph data shows that in 2025, software projects owned by
EU-based developers or organizations received over 934,000 contributions from US-based
developers, followed by over 553,000 from the UK and over 347,000 from India. There is a
long tail of contributors from all over the world: The top three contributing nations together
make up less than half of total external contributions to EU open source projects. These
numbers illustrate that the notion of EU open source is a complex one: Even when the
development of an open source component is primarily driven by EU-based developers, or
takes place under the responsibility of an EU entity, it is common for non-EU developers to
play a critical role in the project, and vice versa. Global collaboration is an integral
component of open source that must be preserved.

It is very common for the maintainers of significant open source projects to reside in multiple
jurisdictions, consisting of a mixture of volunteers and employees of diverse companies
from around the world8. Even when Europeans make up a significant part of the maintainer
pool, it is unclear whether the Commission would consider such a project as part of the
European open-source community. In GitHubâs view, the geographic origin of an open
source project should not preclude it from benefiting from the European Open Digital
Ecosystem strategy, provided that the project has a transparent governance structure and
it is used in the EU.

 Conversely, the enormous success of EU-made 9 open source software in the rest of the
world should not be seen as a threat to EU interests. Rather, the EU can expand its global
influence, shaping the direction of technological progress, by supporting EU-based open
source software businessesâ ambitions to enter markets outside of the EU (see
Recommendation 2), and by helping European developers to instill open source values of
openness, transparency and interoperability into global standard-setting processes (see
Recommendation 5). Open source enables competition by countering lock-in effects. It also
allows diverse actors to collaborate in an environment of incomplete trust, as any actor can
walk away at any time and continue software development along a new fork. As a
consequence, the global exploitation of open source software reduces technological
dependencies for all participants. If European companies face greater barriers to turning
open source assets into business success than their non-European counterparts, a
stipulation that should be studied in detail, the reasons could be more closely related to the
business landscape than inherent to open source (see Recommendation 2).

    II. Recommendations for the European Open Digital Ecosystem
        Strategy
Based on the general strategic considerations outlined in the first chapter, GitHub
recommends the following specific measures that the European Commission should
pursue to support the development and growth of the EU open source sector and contribute
to the EUâs competitiveness, technological sovereignty and cybersecurity.

     1. EU Sovereign Tech Fund
In a recently published study 10 by OpenForum Europe, Fraunhofer ISI and European
University Institute, to which GitHub contributed, the authors make the case for a European
Sovereign Tech Fund (EU-STF) that is ideally suited to meet the European Commissionâs
objective of taking âa strategic approach to the open source sector in the EU that addresses
the importance of open source as a crucial contribution to EU technological sovereignty,
security and competitivenessâ 11 . The EU-STF is an initiative to scale up the successful
approach of the German governmentâs Sovereign Tech Agency of investment into
foundational open source components to the European level. The study makes a detailed
case for the contributions that an EU-STF would make to the EUâs technological sovereignty,
cybersecurity and competitiveness, which are briefly summarized below.

Technological Sovereignty
The EU-STF would strengthen technological sovereignty by strengthening Europe's capacity
to shape, develop, and control its digital infrastructure and technologies through targeted
investment into its open source stack. This would reduce single points of failure, enable the
EU to make independent choices in the digital realm, and promote its own values and
strategic interests globally. The EU-STF would allow EU companies and administrations to
more easily adapt their digital systems in the face of disruptions, whether technical, political,
or economic, giving them the ability to sustain core functions under stress.

Cybersecurity
The EU-STF would strengthen the EUâs cybersecurity by directly investing in the
maintenance and security of widely used open source components within Europe's digital
infrastructure. Open source components are not more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats
than proprietary software; their transparent nature can even support the early detection and
remediation of cybersecurity issues. Nevertheless, high-profile cybersecurity incidents
such as Log4Shell 12 show that the global fallout can be enormous when open source
maintainers are taken for granted and not given the support they deserve. The EU-STF could
complement existing regulatory efforts such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and private
sector initiatives like the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund13 or the Open Source Security

Foundation 14 to support cybersecurity best practices in open source software and to
support EU businesses in preparing for CRA compliance.

Competitiveness
The EU-STF contributes to Europeâs ability to innovate, produce, and scale digital
technologies and services in ways that are economically viable and globally relevant. It does
so by strengthening Europeâs open digital base, reducing reliance on single vendors, and
supporting strategic technological capabilities.

The feasibility study examines possible legal mechanisms for establishing an EU-STF and
recommends utilizing the novel mechanism of the European Digital Infrastructure
Consortium (EDIC) to pool funding from the upcoming EU budget (recommending a
minimum EU contribution of â¬ 350 million over seven years, to be included in the European
Competitiveness Fund), national budgets of participating Member States, and industry
contributions to invest in the maintenance, security and sustainability of widely used open
source components. GitHub welcomes the recent creation of the Digital Commons EDIC,
which could play a central role in the realization of the EU-STF. In this context, the European
Commissionâs assessment that the Digital Commons EDIC will not be limited to public
service applications is encouraging. The EDIC approach is favored over the creation of a
centralized fund at EU level, as it would best meet the funding criteria or pooled
contributions from the EU, Member States and industry, low bureaucracy for recipients
(building on the Sovereign Tech Agencyâs model of procuring work from maintainers),
political independency, flexibility (benefiting individual maintainers, companies and
nonprofits), community focus, strategic alignment and transparency.

GitHub is convinced that the supporting the EU-STF is the single most impactful policy
measure that the European Commission could undertake to strengthen the European open
source ecosystem, with direct positive impact on technological sovereignty, cybersecurity
and competitiveness. The proposal for the EU-STF has been endorsed 15 by over 40
companies, open source foundations and civil society organizations and highlighted in a
recent study for the European Parliamentâs ITRE committee as a central measure to
strengthen Europeâs technological sovereignty while balancing openness and autonomy.16

   2. Support the Growth of Open Source Businesses
The widespread use and global adoption of open source software originating from Europe
should be seen as a success story and the foundation for future economic growth, rather
than a problem. To capitalize on this opportunity, the Commissionâs strategy should focus
on empowering European companies to supply the global markets with commercial
services, maintenance and value chains that underpin these open technologies. Europe
possesses a distinct competitive advantage in this area: The EUâs inherently multilingual
Single Market positions European ventures to build adaptable, internationalized solutions
that are highly attractive to global customers.

European open source businesses are engaged in a highly competitive global race for
talents. The European Commission should set them up for success by removing
administrative barriers to the employment of open source developers by European
companies and nonprofits, regardless of the talentâs citizenship or place of residence within
the EU. The Commission could guide Member States in the exercise of administrative
discretion and streamline efforts to support the creation of jobs for open source experts by
SMEs. By fostering a welcoming administrative environment, simplifying the administrative
burden for work permits and freelancing visas, the EU and its Member States can help the
ecosystem to rapidly assemble the diverse, international teams needed to build world-class
software.

In that regard, we welcome the prospect of the ongoing legislative effort for the 28th regime.
It offers a way to remove administrative barriers that currently limit the European open
source ecosystem. To meet its needs, the 28th regime should not only benefit startups, but
also mature SMEs and non-profit associations that build open source software as a public
good. By providing a single European set of rules for companies and non-profits, this
framework should allow organizations like AISBLs to hire specialized remote talent from any
Member State without managing 27 different national labor and tax systems. Ultimately,
nonprofits should be able to form a single European legal entity, a Unified EU Association.

Open source entities also face disadvantages in accessing funding that the EU should
address as part of its Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy. The EU provides significant funding
and support for research and innovation, but the current conditions of large-scale research
and development funding schemes run the risk of excluding the open source model. Open
source projects are distinct from traditional industry and academic partners. The
Commission should clarify that these projects can participate in EU programs without being
treated as commercial industry partners. Specifically, not-for-profit open source projects
should not be subject to the same co-funding obligations as for-profit companies.
Furthermore, dissemination and exploitation rules should not require proprietary
commercialization strategies. This approach could run contrary to open source software
models. We recommend that the Commission screen and test these rules to ensure that
code generated through EU-funded projects can be released by all participants in funding
schemes to everyone in a non-exclusive manner under recognized open source licenses.

   3. Strengthen the OSPO Network
Due to the wide use of open source software in the software stacks of European companies
and public administrations, it is crucial for Member States to develop internal capabilities
to manage, create, and secure open source projects. This work requires a blend of legal,
engineering, security, marketing, and community-building skills. Establishing an Open
Source Program Office (OSPO), a dedicated team of experts, enables organizations to
effectively coordinate these complex processes. By doing so, OSPOs accelerate innovation,
reduce legal and security risks and costs, and improve transparency. An OSPO empowers
organizations to successfully use and create open source software by managing the
adoption of new technologies, overseeing open source dependencies selected by
engineering staff, and serving as a liaison with both proprietary vendors and open source
maintainers.
OSPOs also play a critical role in setting open source license compliance and security
policies, ensuring responsible and safe use of open source components. Key tasks include
license compliance, vulnerability management, and fostering collaboration. For maximum
effectiveness, OSPOs should include cross-functional team members who have clear
authority to set and enforce policies, as well as high visibility and access to engineering,
security, legal, and other relevant teams. Individual Member States may tailor the structure
of their OSPOs to best suit their local conditions and needs.
The European Commission should build upon the success of its own OSPO by turning it into
an inter-DG unit reporting to both DG CNECT and DG DIGIT, with responsibility for the
successful implementation of the Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy. The dual reporting
relationship would account for the internal and external elements of the strategy. In addition
to supporting the EUâs industrial open source strategy, this elevated EU OSPO should be
resourced to more effectively support Member States in establishing OSPOs and to connect
them through the EU OSPO network. Sharing best practices, tools, and timely information is
vital for continuous improvement and for collectively addressing emerging challenges in
open source software. Connecting OSPOs multiplies their effectiveness by enabling shared
resources, faster responses to new issues, and coordinated advocacy for open source
adoption.
   4. Empower Civil Servants to Become Open Source Contributors
For the public sector to improve interaction with and participate in the wider open
ecosystem, the strategy should encourage internal skill building alongside clear
administrative governance. The Commission should support open source literacy for civil
servants, encompassing all forms of interaction with open source communities. In addition,
the Commission should adopt actionable rules that allow its civil servants to contribute to
open source projects through code, documentation or project management as a recognized
and appropriate part of their official duties, while encouraging Member States to adopt
similar rules for their civil servants. In that sense, we consider the Commission Decision of
8 December 2021 on the open source licensing and reuse of Commission software 2021/C
495 a positive step in the right direction, and we ask the Commission to move forward in that
direction. This should apply to both the Commissionâs own services as well as to other
administrations within the European Union. To further improve this Commission Decision,
the Commission should turn the General principle of Article 3 from a âmay chooseâ into a
âshallâ provision. Unless compelling reasons exist against the release of software under
open source licenses, the software should be released. Article 4 already includes a
comprehensive list of exceptions to account for those reasons.

   5. Promote Access to Standards and the Standardization Process
Open source software risks being marginalized if the technical standards required for
compliance and interoperability are not available to developers. To provide an example, the
standard describing the popular QR code mechanism is standardized as ISO/IEC
18004:2024. While many libraries exist, a verification and deeper analysis of edge cases,
security related analysis and research require access to the standard. As a consequence,
developers building open source QR code generators or readers face obstacles in
implementing the standard. We urge the Commission to go beyond legislative requirements
and actively promote free access to essential standards for the general public and all
developers.

Furthermore, the EU should implement support mechanisms that enable open source
experts to attend and physically participate in standard-setting bodies. As open source
developers often contribute in the context of SMEs, nonprofits or in a personal capacity, they
require compensation for the time and travel costs associated with the participation in
standardization activities. Most of the standardization work is being conducted online.
However, crucial meetings still take place in physical formats and require presence on site.
Attendance to these meetings is a key requirement for being able to get heard during the
standardization process. The European Commission should build upon initiatives such as
Stan4CRA17 and extend financial support for open source software developers wishing to
participate in standardization activities beyond the context of the Cyber Resilience Act.

       6. Enable and Encourage Reuse of EU Open Data
Open source thrives in an open landscape. To increase the impact of a strategy directed at
open source, the Commission should simultaneously promote access to and reuse of
diverse datasets, including from the public sector. Open data and open source software are
mutually reinforcing: Accessible data fuels the creation of new tools, while open source
software provides everyone with the means to utilize that information. We recommend
expanding the list of datasets referenced in Implementing Regulation EU 2023/138 on high-
value datasets, as well as efforts to provide consolidated joint datasets for the entire
European Union.

Especially in the field of geospatial datasets identified by the Implementing Regulation, the
European Commission should maintain a pan-European joint dataset to facilitate re-use
and to avoid the technical burden of having to deal with 27+ datasets with the risk of minor,
but cumulative deviations in formatting. The European open source community provides
successful, widely used navigation, mapping, and routing tools, which would greatly benefit
from increased availability of openly licensed geospatial information such as land register
information, satellite and orthophotography, which is in scope of the Open Data Directive.
To fully realize the potential of these open source software applications, the Open Data
Directive and the Data Act as its designated successor under the Digital Omnibus should
codify a positive right to access public sector data in addition to establishing rules for re-use
where access exists by virtue of another legal provision.

Access to and the right to re-use datasets from European public bodies is an important part
of a healthy Open Digital Ecosystem. The right to re-use should â as it is already stated in the
EU Open Data Directive â be established through open licenses. Open licenses, such as
Creative Commons CC-BY, permit the re-use, both for commercial and non-commercial
purposes, by everyone. We are concerned about the proposal in the Digital Omnibus to
introduce special conditions for âvery large companiesâ. To prevent those companies from
re-using content, the public sector body would have to use licenses that are in direct conflict
with open licensing principles. In this scenario, everyone loses, not just the very large
companies but also everyone else whose projects, businesses, and means of operation
depend on commonly agreed open licenses. Many open source and open content projects
have long-standing and well-established policies that require code and other content to be
released under a free license. These projects would refuse to accept data with license

17
     https://www.stan4cra.eu/
restrictions that exclude groups of people or companies from using and reusing the data.
Mixing and merging content under different open licenses is already a challenge because
different attribution or âshare-alikeâ clauses can add up to confusing re-use conditions.
Adding special license conditions for the re-use of public sector datasets by very large
companies would exacerbate such license conflicts.

In addition, the European Commission should encourage Member States and their agencies
to provide access, further collect and better archive such data using established data
formats and establish practices that provide for convenient bulk data access for research
and development. The European Commission currently follows a âfree unless notedâ
practice. This means that general permission for re-use is given, with exceptions. We
support this approach but note that it puts the burden of looking for these exceptions on the
person trying to re-use the content. The Commission should maintain its âfree unless notedâ
policy but should at the same time more proactively communicate when content is free for
reuse under the Commission Decision of 12 December 2011 and/or specific Creative
Commons licenses.

     7. Research and Monitoring
Research and monitoring are essential for the successful implementation of any strategy.
To assess whether the European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy has achieved its goal of
growing the societal and economic impact of the EU open source ecosystem, and to provide
an evidence base for future policy making, the European Commission should fund regular
data collection and analysis aimed at understanding the open source ecosystem. Future
research should focus on three core tasks:

Mapping open source dependencies
The Commission should conduct research to identify which open source components are
most critical to Europeâs digital infrastructure. This will help prioritize support for the
projects that European businesses and public services rely on most.

Expanding the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)
We recommend including "open source readiness" as a metric in the DESI dashboard for the
Digital Decade.18 This would allow the Commission to track how effectively Member States
are adopting open technologies and where more support is needed.

18
  https://digital-decade-desi.digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/datasets/desi/charts âThe European
Commission has been monitoring Member Statesâ digital progress through the Digital Economy and Society
Index (DESI) reports since 2014. As of 2023, DESI is now integrated into the State of the Digital Decade report
and used to monitor progress towards the digital targets.â
Regular economic impact studies
A 2021 study conducted for the European Commission by OpenForum Europe and
Fraunhofer ISI 19 provided an important evidence base for the impact of open source
software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in
the EU economy, finding that open source contributes between â¬65 and â¬95 billion to EU
GDP. These numbers would likely be much higher if the analysis was repeated on the basis
of current economic data. The European Commission should conduct regular economic
impact studies on open source software and hardware to track the success of its policy and
funding interventions.
