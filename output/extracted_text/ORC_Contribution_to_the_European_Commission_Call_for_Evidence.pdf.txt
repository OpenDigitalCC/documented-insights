 Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group
 European Open Digital Ecosystems
 Date: 2026/02/03

Context
The Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group (ORC WG) brings together open source
communities, foundations, and manufacturers working on the practical implementation of
digital regulation.

From this operational perspective, open digital ecosystems are not only a policy objective
but a prerequisite for scalable compliance, supply-chain security, and long-term
competitiveness for both industry and public sector actors.

We suggest approaching digital sovereignty not by the geographic origin of code ('Made in
Europe'), but by retaining operational control over technology, so that the policies avoid
fragmentation that would isolate European entities from the global innovation taking place in
established open source communities.

Key Areas of Action
1. Practical portability and interoperability of open source
ecosystems
Large companies and SMEs alike depend on open source projects hosted on software
forges. While source code portability is largely solved, project data portability is not,
creating operational friction and long-term dependencies.

Supporting open, documented APIs and formats for exporting and importing project data
(issues, CI, metadata, security information) would:

   ââ Reduce platform lock-in risks,
   ââ improve business continuity,
   ââ increase resilience across the software supply chain.

Community-driven initiatives such as ForgeFriends and CodeCommons show that
interoperability can be achieved without disrupting existing platforms and deserve EU
support.

2. Resilient digital services for software supply chains
Build, distribution, and dependency services (e.g. package repositories and registries) are
now critical infrastructure for European industry, including regulated sectors.

Ensuring resilience through:

   ââ Contingency planning,

   ââ Federated services instead of centralised,
   ââ EU-based mirrors,
   ââ A EU based capability for continuous build, test and integration at scale of all the
      software packages that are key to society in general and to open source in particular.
      Including the institutional capacity and capability to maintain such in cooperation with
      the open source community
   ââ and archival layers such as Software Heritage,

supports risk management and business continuity without changing existing
development models.

Resilience requires a shift from passive consumption to an 'Upstream First'
development and security model.

3. Open source Attestations as the balance factor for
compliance and sustainability
To bridge the gap between regulatory requirements and the reality of open source
development, verifiable attestations offer a mechanism for continuous trust. These digital
proofs provide secure evidence of how software components are built, tested, and secured
throughout the supply chain.
Supporting and standardising the use of open source attestation frameworks would:

   ââ Provide a lightweight, verifiable way to demonstrate compliance with regulations like
      the CRA.
   ââ Enhance automation for both security and compliance tooling.
   ââ Foster a high-trust, low-friction environment essential for the long-term sustainability
      of open source ecosystems.
   ââ Strengthen transparency and accountability across the software supply chain.
   ââ Enable non-profit open source Foundations to act as neutral facilitators of attestation
      infrastructure, leveraging their stewardship role to host, maintain, and coordinate
      attestation frameworks in a vendor-neutral and publicly accountable manner, and
      with instruments such as implementing act.

4. Compliance enablement through open source tools
Regulations such as the CRA introduce lifecycle security and documentation requirements
that affect manufacturers of all sizes.

Open source compliance tooling (SBOM generation, vulnerability tracking, provenance,
license analysis) already:

   ââ lowers implementation costs,
   ââ improves transparency,
   ââ supports automation at scale.

Promoting and supporting these tools helps the industry demonstrate compliance
efficiently, rather than adding additional burden.

5. Reliable identification of software components
For CRA-aligned SBOMs, identifying what exact software artefact is used is increasingly
critical for manufacturers and integrators.

Content-based, persistent identifiers such as Package-URL or SWHIDs provide:

   ââ forge-independent identification,
   ââ long-term traceability,
   ââ improved auditability.

Recognising such identifiers as best practice strengthens supply-chain security without
imposing new development constraints.

6. Responsible use of open source in AI development
Source code is a major input for AI training, including general-purpose models. From a
compliance and security perspective, traceability and accountability are essential.

Promoting mechanisms that link generated code back to archived origins helps:

   ââ reduce legal and security uncertainty,
   ââ support regulated industries,
   ââ maintain trust in AI-assisted development.

Conclusion
Open digital ecosystems are a strategic enabler of Europeâs technological sovereignty,
industrial competitiveness, and regulatory effectiveness. For industry and public
administrations alike, the challenge is no longer whether to rely on open source, but how to
do so sustainably, securely, and at scale under emerging regulatory frameworks such
as the Cyber Resilience Act.

From ORCâs operational experience, the most effective path forward is not additional
regulation of open source, but targeted support for the infrastructure, practices, and
tooling that allow regulation to be implemented efficiently. We support the idea of a
European Sovereign Tech Fund that invests in the maintenance of critical basic open
source technologies, such as libraries or programming languages.

The Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group recommends
that the European Commission:
   1.â Recognise open source as a Global community assetâ
       Open source success is rooted in the global community. The European Commission
       should embrace global cooperation, recognising that worldwide code improvements
       benefit Europe and support essential security and compliance.â

  2.â Treat open source infrastructure as a strategic assetâ
      Recognise software forges, package repositories, build systems, and archives as
      part of Europeâs digital backbone, and support their resilience through interoperability,
      mirroring, and contingency planning.â

  3.â Strengthen continuous trust through open source attestationsâ
      Support the standardisation and use of open source attestation frameworks that
      provide verifiable evidence of how software components are built, tested, and
      secured throughout the supply chain for demonstrating compliance with regulations.â

  4.â Develop specific regulatory guidance supporting the activities of open source
      Foundations as vendor neutral non-comercial actorsâ
      Foundation-led attestation activities are explicitly recognised as trust-enabling
      infrastructure rather than commercial compliance or certification services. Such
      clarification â through implementing acts or guidance â is necessary to provide
      legal certainty for not-for-profit foundations in many Member States and to avoid
      unintended competition with commercial service providers.â

  5.â Develop specific regulatory guidance supporting the activities of open source

      Foundation-led attestation activities are explicitly recognised as trust-enabling
      infrastructure rather than commercial compliance or certification services. Such
      clarification, through implementing acts or guidance, is necessary to provide legal
      certainty for not-for-profit Foundations in many Member States and to avoid
      unintended competition with commercial service providers.â

  6.â Promote interoperability and portability by designâ
      Encourage open, documented APIs and formats that enable full project portability
      across platforms, reducing lock-in risks and improving long-term sustainability for
      both companies and public institutions.â

  7.â Ensure Friction-Free Access to Open Standardsâ
      With increasing regulation, all compliance standards must be available to all, free of
      charge, and in implementation-ready formats. This is essential to prevent stifling
      innovation and to maintain the virtuous feedback loop that underpins an open digital
      economy and innovation.â

  8.â Enable compliance through open source toolingâ
      Actively support open source solutions for SBOMs, vulnerability management,
      provenance, and compliance automation, ensuring that companiesâespecially
      SMEsâcan meet regulatory requirements without disproportionate cost or
      complexity.â

  9.â Strengthen software traceability and supply-chain trustâ
      Endorse content-based, persistent identifiers (such as Package-URL SWHIDs) as
      best practice for identifying software artefacts in regulated environments, supporting
      CRA implementation and long-term auditability.â

   10.âAlign AI, software, and cybersecurity policiesâ
       Promote responsible use of open source code in AI training by supporting traceability
       mechanisms that enhance legal certainty, security, and trust, without limiting
       innovation.â

   11.âPromote âUpstream Firstâ development and security modelsâ
       Encouraging maintenance and active contribution back to upstream projects,
       because organizations contributing code capture significantly higher value and
       security benefits than those that merely consume it.

By focusing on enablement rather than enforcement, the European Commission can
foster an open digital ecosystem where regulation becomes a shared framework for trust
and resilience, rather than a barrier to innovation. ORCWG stands ready to continue
contributing practical expertise, community coordination, and implementation feedback to
support this objective.
