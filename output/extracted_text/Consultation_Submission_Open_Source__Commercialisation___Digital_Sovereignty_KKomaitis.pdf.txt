Consultation Submission â Open Source, Commercialisation & Digital Sovereignty

1. Introduction

I welcome the European Commissionâs initiative to develop a strategic approach to open source as
part of the EUâs broader agenda on technological sovereignty, competitiveness, and cybersecurity.
Open source software (OSS) and open digital commons are already deeply embedded in Europeâs
digital economy and public infrastructures and represent a critical asset for reducing structural
dependencies, increasing resilience, and fostering innovation.

I note the emerging policy discussion around supporting and potentially âcommercialisingâ open
source to advance sovereignty objectives. While the development of sustainable European open
source businesses is both necessary and desirable, any such approach must preserve the
fundamental characteristics that make open source valuable in the first place. Commercialisation
should therefore be understood not as enclosure or restriction, but as enabling long-term
sustainability, market integration, and adoption without sacrificing openness, interoperability, and
community governance.

2. Open Source Accelerates Innovation, Collaboration and Interoperable Sovereignty

Open source software fosters collaboration across borders, sectors, and institutions. It enables:

    â¢   Faster innovation through reuse of proven, modular building blocks;
    â¢   Shared maintenance and security improvements by diverse and distributed contributors;
    â¢   Lower costs for development, deployment, and long-term operation; and
    â¢   Interoperability and standards alignment, reducing fragmentation and dependency on
        single vendors.

Beyond efficiency and cost benefits, open source underpins a model of interoperable sovereignty:
digital autonomy achieved not through isolation or centralised control, but through openness,
cooperation, and shared technical foundations. By enabling systems to interoperate across
organisational and national boundaries, open source supports a democratic alternative to digitally
closed or authoritarian models of technological governance, where control is concentrated and
interoperability is restricted.

Concrete example â France (DINUM):
Franceâs Interministerial Digital Directorate (DINUM) has promoted the systematic use of open
source solutions (such as Linux, LibreOffice, Matrix and Nextcloud) across public administrations.
This approach enables interoperability between ministries while avoiding dependency on single
vendors or non-EU platforms. It demonstrates how open source allows public bodies to retain
control over their digital infrastructure while remaining connected, reusable, and aligned with
democratic governance principles.

These characteristics are core elements in the EUâs pursuit of digital sovereignty, competitiveness,
and resilient public digital infrastructures.

3. Added Value of Open Source for Public and Private Sectors
Open source delivers concrete and measurable added value to both public administrations and
private organisations.

For the public sector, OSS:

    â¢   Reduces vendor lock-in and long-term costs;
    â¢   Enables transparency, auditability, and accountability;
    â¢   Facilitates reuse of solutions across administrations and borders; and
    â¢   Strengthens cybersecurity through collective review and shared maintenance.

For the private sector, open source:

    â¢   Lowers barriers to entry for startups and SMEs;
    â¢   Encourages competition on quality, services, and innovation rather than proprietary control;
    â¢   Enables faster time-to-market through reuse of mature components; and
    â¢   Supports interoperability in complex supply chains and digital ecosystems.

Concrete example â Cloud and infrastructure ecosystems:
Linux and Kubernetes, both open source, underpin the majority of modern cloud and infrastructure
environments. Their openness allows European companies and public administrations to adopt
multi-cloud and hybrid strategies, avoid dependency on single providers, and retain the ability to
migrate, audit, and adapt systems as needed. This illustrates how open source enables sovereignty
through choice and portability, rather than exclusion.

4. Commercialisation of Open Source: Opportunities and Risks

Supporting commercial activity around open source is essential for sustainability, maintenance, and
scaling. However, commercialisation must not undermine the very benefits that open source
provides.

The key risk lies in approaches that:

    â¢   Restrict access or reuse through quasi-proprietary licensing;
    â¢   Fragment ecosystems through incompatible forks; or
    â¢   Prioritise short-term monetisation over long-term community sustainability.

By contrast, sustainable and sovereignty-enhancing commercialisation models are those that:

    â¢   Build businesses around services, support, integration, certification, and training;
    â¢   Contribute improvements back to upstream open source projects; and
    â¢   Reinforce open standards and interoperability.

Concrete example â Smart cities and SMEs (FIWARE):
FIWARE, an EU-backed open source framework, provides reusable components for smart cities,
mobility, energy, and IoT solutions across Europe. Its open architecture enables SMEs and startups
to build competitive services without dependence on proprietary platforms, while maintaining
interoperability across cities and Member States. This demonstrates how public investment in open
source can stimulate commercial ecosystems without enclosure.

5. Open Source, Security and Resilience
Open source plays a critical role in cybersecurity and digital resilience. Transparency allows code to
be inspected, audited, and improved by a broad community, reducing the risk of hidden
vulnerabilities and single points of failure.

Concrete example â Shared security infrastructure:
Widely used open source security components such as cryptographic libraries benefit from
continuous review by global communities. When vulnerabilities are discovered, coordinated
responses improve security across the entire ecosystem. This shared responsibility model enhances
resilience, particularly for critical digital infrastructure, and aligns with the EUâs cybersecurity
objectives.

6. Policy Recommendations

To strengthen the European open source ecosystem while preserving its core benefits, we
recommend that the Commission:

    1. Support long-term maintenance and sustainability of critical open source projects,
       including through dedicated funding mechanisms and public-private partnerships.
    2. Use public procurement strategically to encourage adoption of open source and open
       standards, while rewarding contributions back to communities.
    3. Promote interoperable sovereignty,1 ensuring that EU-supported solutions remain open,
       standards-based, and compatible across borders and sectors.
    4. Enable open source business models that focus on services, integration, and support rather
       than restrictive licensing.
    5. Engage actively with global open source communities, recognising that Europeâs digital
       sovereignty is strengthened through leadership and collaboration, not isolation.

7. Conclusion

Open source is a cornerstone of Europeâs digital present and future. It is a public good that
simultaneously enables innovation, competitiveness, security, and democratic control. While
commercial sustainability is essential, it must reinforce â not replace â openness, interoperability,
and community governance.

By embracing open source as a foundation for interoperable sovereignty, the European Union can
strengthen its technological autonomy while remaining open, competitive, and aligned with its
fundamental values.
