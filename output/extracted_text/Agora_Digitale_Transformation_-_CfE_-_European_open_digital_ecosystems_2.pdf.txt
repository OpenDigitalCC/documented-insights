Submission to the Call for Evidence
âTowards European open digital ecosystemsâ

Executive summary
Europe already hosts strong open-source communities and produces a significant share of
foundational digital building blocks. Yet the EU often does not capture proportional value, and
many promising projects struggle to scale beyond expert users. To unlock Europeâs competitive-
ness, resilience and democratic capacity, the EU Open Source Strategy should:

      â Treat usability and product development as first-order policy goals, not a ânice-to-
          haveâ: open-source solutions often lose at the last mile (UX, onboarding, design, dis-
          tribution).
      â Shift from short-term innovation funding to lifecycle funding, including long-term
          maintenance, security response, governance and operations (10 to 20 year horizons for
          infrastructure-like software).
      â Expand the strategic lens beyond âfoundational librariesâ to include user-facing,
          society-shaping digital infrastructures where Europe faces structural dependencies
          (e.g., communication/discovery and mapping/geo layers).
      â Build one ecosystem, not many silos: enable cross-sector interoperability and com-
          patibility so open-source solutions can reach critical mass.
      â Use EU-level instruments to âopenâ closed ecosystems where feasible, not to spon-
          sor new projects but to support transitions that increase the overall stock of reusable,
          auditable software.
      â Create a credible data base on economic value, adoption barriers and value capture,
          to support Member States and public buyers in prioritisation and sustained investment.

Question 1
  Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector; main
  barriers to adoption, maintenance and sustainable
  contributions

Strengths

The EU has a strong base of open-source talent, research capacity, and community-driven in-
novation. Europe contributes substantially to foundational components that underpin modern
digital systems. These communities and practices are a strategic asset: they cultivate skills, en-
able knowledge diffusion, and create the conditions for durable innovation and should be used
as such in positioning the EUâs digital (economic) policy vis-Ã -vis the US and China.

                                                                                                                  1/6
Weaknesses and barriers (clustered)

A) The âproductisation gapâ (from developer tool to mass adoption)
A recurring barrier is that many open-source initiatives are built primarily by and for technically
proficient communities. As a result, critical elements for adoption at scale (usability, design,
onboarding, documentation for non-experts, localisation, accessibility, product management,
distribution) are under-resourced. This gap is not merely cosmetic: it determines whether open
source remains a niche or becomes a mainstream option capable of competing with dominant
proprietary offerings.

B) Sustainability gap (maintenance and security over time)
Even widely used open-source components and applications frequently rely on fragile funding
structures and volunteer labour. The EU and Member States often fund innovation but under-
fund maintenance, security hardening, incident response, and long-term operations. In a simi-
lar vein, necessary endeavours to transfer and scale working solutions (i.e. software documen-
tation, documentation of organizational practices, standardization / interoperability, transferra-
ble business models, marketing, etc.) are underfunded. Depending on the respective area, sus-
tainability can be provided both by business models and market forces or â where inapplicable â
by public funding in the interest of Europeâs democratic societies.

C) Fragmentation into sectoral silos
Open-source ecosystems are commonly organised by sector (govtech, smart city, social,
health, education, etc.) with limited cross-sector coordination. This fragmentation hampers in-
teroperability and compatibility, reduces reuse, and prevents the formation of critical mass. It
also increases duplicated effort and weakens shared maintenance capacity.

D) Value capture outside the EU and weak political/economic narrative in Member States
Europe often contributes significantly to upstream work, while downstream commercialisation
and value capture happen elsewhere. Moreover, in many Member States open source is still per-
ceived as niche or secondary, partly because robust, comparable data on economic impact,
adoption drivers and public value is missing. This inhibits sustained political prioritisation and
long-term investment decisions.

Question 2
  Added value of open source for public and private sectors (with
  examples and factors to assess)
Open source delivers value not only as a procurement option, but as a governance model for
critical digital infrastructure. Its added value is best assessed across economic, security, and
democratic dimensions.

A) Reducing economic and societal structural dependencies
For both public and private actors, open source can mitigate lock-in and dependency risks. Im-
portantly, dependency is not only economic. In several âeverydayâ digital layers, e.g. communi-
cation, discovery, mapping, Europe is heavily reliant on a small number of globally dominant
platforms. These layers shape market access, information flows, and civic discourse.

                                                                                                      2/6
Examples of high-dependency layers with high public relevance:

     â Communication and public discourse infrastructure (e.g., social networking and re-
         lated services as well as civic tech and public participation tools)
     â Discovery and access layers (e.g., web search and AI agents, app stores, browser de-
         faults, recommender systems)
     â Geospatial and mapping layers (e.g., maps, points of interest, routing-related com-
         ponents)

B) Transparency and accountability as democratic value
Open source can increase inspectability of critical systems, including algorithmic curation and
AI-enabled decision support, when paired with good documentation and governance. This sup-
ports democratic oversight, auditing, and contestability â characteristics especially relevant
where digital systems influence public debate, access to services, or allocation decisions.

C) Cyber resilience through verifiability and repairability
Open source can strengthen cyber resilience by enabling broader review, faster patching, and
reduced dependence on a single vendorâs timelines, if maintenance and security processes are
funded and professionalised. The assessment should therefore consider not only licensing, but
governance maturity, security practices, and maintenance capacity.

D) Innovation and competitiveness through ecosystem effects
Open source lowers barriers for SMEs and public administrations to build on shared compo-
nents, creating spillovers and enabling European service markets (support, integration, host-
ing, compliance, training). âCommunity vitalityâ itself becomes a competitiveness factor, in-
cluding talent attraction, learning effects, and faster diffusion of innovation.

Key factors to assess added value (context-dependent):

     â Lock-in and switching costs
     â Long-term operational risk and continuity
     â Security governance and response capacity
     â Ability to audit/verify (incl. AI-related systems)
     â Interoperability and reuse potential
     â Market structure effects (openness for SMEs, contestability)

                                                                                                  3/6
Question 3
  Concrete EU-level measures and actions to support
  development and growth, and contribute to technological
  sovereignty and cybersecurity
We recommend a strategy that treats open source as infrastructure policy and ecosystem pol-
icy, not only as software funding.

A) Fund adoption, not only code: make usability a strategic objective
Create dedicated EU support for the âlast mileâ:

      â UX/UI, service design, accessibility, localisation
      â Product management and user research
      â Reuse, business model development, scaling, interoperability
      â Documentation for non-expert adoption (public sector and SMEs)
A practical approach is to establish user-facing tracks within EU funding instruments, with eval-
uation criteria that reward demonstrated adoption and user outcomes, while remaining com-
patible with open-source community practices.

B) Establish lifecycle funding for maintenance, security, and operations (10 to 20 years
   where needed)
For software that functions as digital infrastructure, sustainability must be designed in:

      â Multi-year maintenance and security response funding
      â Support for professional governance and stewardship roles
      â Funding for dependency management, secure build/release pipelines, and vulnerabil-
         ity handling
      â Operational support for long-lived services where appropriate
This should complement support for foundational components, but broaden it to include user-
facing infrastructure where dependencies are societally significant.

C) Build one ecosystem: interoperability and compatibility as scaling mechanisms
EU action can reduce fragmentation by:

      â Supporting open standards and shared interfaces
      â Funding interoperability work and cross-sector reference architectures
      â Enabling reusable components across public administration, civic services, and pri-
         vate markets
      â Incentivising compatibility to help projects reach critical mass

                                                                                                    4/6
D) âOpeningâ as a strategic lever: expand the open ecosystem by transitioning closed
   assets
Beyond sponsoring new open-source projects, the EU should consider instruments that help
transition selected closed-source solutions toward open models where it increases resilience
and market contestability:

      â Transition funding for re-licensing and governance redesign
      â Support for migration paths and community handover models
      â Incentives for open components in previously closed ecosystems
This is not a blanket approach; it requires clear criteria (public value, dependency reduction,
feasibility, security governance).

E) Procurement and policy frameworks that reward sustainability
Public purchasing power can stabilise ecosystems if procurement moves from âpilot projectsâ
to sustainable adoption:

      â Procurement criteria for maintainability, interoperability, and openness of interfaces
      â Requirements or incentives for contributing back (where appropriate)
      â Contract structures that fund long-term maintenance and security work (not only de-
          livery)

F) Build a robust evidence base and monitoring capability
A credible EU-wide data effort would help Member States treat open source as strategic:

      â Mapping value chains and potential EU value capture
      â Measuring adoption barriers (incl. usability/skills)
      â Quantifying dependency hotspots and strategic layers
      â Identifying where targeted interventions yield the highest resilience and competitive-
          ness returns

G) Finance models beyond business cases: include public-civic approaches
Not all high-value open-source infrastructure will sustain itself through market revenue alone.
The EU should explore mixed models:

      â Public-private partnerships where appropriate
      â Public-civic partnerships and public-civic-private models for infrastructure-like ser-
          vices
      â Long-term stewardship funding where the public interest is strong

                                                                                                  5/6
Question 4
  Technology areas to prioritise and why
In addition to commonly cited foundational layers, the strategy should explicitly include user-
facing digital infrastructures where dependency and public impact are greatest.

A) Communication, discovery and mapping layers (high dependency, high societal
    impact)
These layers shape how people communicate, find information, and navigate the world. They
are deeply embedded in daily life and economic activity, yet currently dominated by a small
number of global providers.

B) Civic and public-service digital infrastructure (adoption potential and public value)
Tools that function as infrastructure for participation and service delivery (e.g., civic participa-
tion platforms, reusable administrative components) should be prioritised because they directly
support state capacity and democratic participation.

C) âInfrastructure by function,â not by technical category
The EU should broaden the definition of infrastructure beyond networks, compute, and low-level
libraries. Many application-level systems (e.g., scheduling/booking infrastructures in health
contexts, POI ecosystems, public service portals) are de facto infrastructure and deserve lifecy-
cle-oriented support.

D) Data and findability infrastructure enabling reuse and interoperability
Without discoverability, shared components do not scale. Priorities should include tooling and
practices that make open components easier to find, evaluate, integrate, and maintain across
sectors.

Question 5
  Sectors where increased open-source use could raise
  competitiveness and cyber resilience
We do not provide a separate sector-by-sector response, as our submission deliberately fo-
cuses on cross-cutting bottlenecks and policy levers that apply horizontally across sectors. The
sectoral implications are therefore embedded in our answers to Questions 1 to 4, in particular
our argument for prioritising âinfrastructure by functionâ.
