About GFMD: Established in 2005, the Global Forum for Media Development (GFMD) is the
largest global community for media development, media freedom, and journalism support
organisations. As a not-for-profit, Belgian-registered AISBL (PIC number: 882063681 and EU
Transparency Register number: 406057138984-97), GFMDâs main focus is to foster
collaboration as well as an exchange of information and experience amongst its network of
currently 219 member and partner organisations from over 80 countries with the aim to foster
viable and independent journalism, greater transparency, and more pluralistic and sustainable
media environments.

GFMD represents a broad cross-section of the international media development and
journalism support community and includes a significant proportion of actors from the Global
Majority and across Creative Europe countries. It enjoys the authority, credibility, and
independence to act as a trusted partner, and is thus well positioned to take a leadership role
in the sector. Over the years, GFMD has strengthened its capacity and reputation both as a
media development and journalism support network, but also as an advisor and consultant to
intergovernmental organisations and major donors working in the field of media assistance.

GFMDâs strongly independent profile is underpinned by a democratically elected governance
structure that draws on multiple skills and diverse backgrounds. Since its establishment, it has
embraced the principle of equality among members from different parts of the world in its
constitution, work ethics, and objectives. Regional diversity, local expertise, and autonomy of
the members are deeply rooted principles in GFMDâs network and actions.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are
the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and
secure open-source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source
communities?

Strengths and Weaknesses â Some of the strengths of the sector include (1) the many
open-source communities that exist throughout Europe with dedicated, knowledgeable
individuals actively building open-source tech across various networks and associations
(ranging from the highly technical Chaos Computer Club of Germany, to the more
business-centric Eurostack initiative), and (2) a growing awareness of and significant will to
address the pitfalls of being depending upon closed-source tech, specifically from technology
companies originating from outside of Europe. And despite the widespread (and often
extractive, non-licensed) use of open-source technology and its value within commercial tech,
Europe has a significant opportunity to be seen as the opposite â a support of and investor in
such open-source technologies and communities.

Amongst the weaknesses, it includes the lack of sustained channels for financing open-tech
development, innovation, and market expansion since the overall landscape is not effectively
distributed nor positioned to address consumer needs and expectations â notably there is a
lack of tech tools to effectively support multi-person collaboration in an accessible,
easy-to-use, and efficient manner.

Moreover, keeping talent in Europe to build, contribute to, and commercialise existing
bottom-up, open-source initiatives are also a challenge, but one that can be rectified with
better support, subsidies, and incentives as well as focusing more on the educational system
and talent pipeline for technology development, ranging from more support for secondary
school and university programmes, training opportunities, digital literacy support, and other
opportunities to build open-source capacity.

Fragmentation could be a barrier as well, especially for scaling, considering Europeâs linguistic
and market diversity across Member States. Yet, cross-border networks, local/national
associations, clubs, and hackerspaces, and even regional/international bodies like the
RÃ©seaux IP EuropÃ©ens (RIPE) community and Europe-wide conferences and gatherings help
to bring those gaps.

An interesting dynamic for the Commission and other EU bodies to consider is the policy,
regulatory, and legal landscape, as it is both a potential strength and a potential weakness. On
the one hand, it is fostering demand for sovereign, European-led, and compliant tech products
and solutions â both within the public and private sectors, and amongst businesses and
consumers. On the other hand, however, it often adds additional compliance burdens on
smaller open-source projects and small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) tech providers,
especially if they are not formally incorporated and act as a loose network of developers and
engineers working on mutually beneficial projects.

PIC: 882063681 | EU Transparency Register: 406057138984-97
As such, policy and regulatory development related to open-source technologies requires a
space for meaningful engagement and the interaction of various stakeholders â from small,
do-it-yourself (DIY) communities to large-scale product developers. Even though their ethical
working principles of open-source tech are the same, their audiences and user bases are
typically different. Thus, the European Commission is rightly positioned to address their needs
and affordances through dialogue and by providing spaces to collaborate.

Lastly, one of the biggest considerations for the EU is the public sectorâs role in open-source
development, adoption, and commercialisation. Europeâs public sector has a huge role to play
here, as examples from Denmark, Austria, and Germany migrating to European,
open-source-centric tech providers demonstrate. It cannot be stressed enough how important
government procurement, investments in public-interest digital infrastructure, and institutional
adoption play in facilitating wider open-source support and adoption. Easing procurement
barriers that favour established vendors (and changing incentive structures and procurement
rules that favour European, open-source, and public-interest technology) could be a significant
way to support open-source technologies, all while strengthening European digital sovereignty,
independence, and resilience as well.

Barriers â Regarding barriers, even though it is easy to understand the downsides of vendor
lock-in from a cost, security, and access perspective, ultimately, accessibility, ease of use, and
reliability will always be key drivers for mass adoption â whether for business-to-business
uses or business-to-consumer, but especially the latter. This is, in our view, the greatest
challenge â someone experiments with an open-source solution, it does not meet the same
expectations (even if it provides relatively analogous functionality) â due to issues ranging
from lack of money for support to not having enough features or the ability to integrate easily
with existing services. Additionally, open-source developers often work on projects as a
passion, but sustained use of open-source tools especially at scale requires significant
resources, innovation, and expertise. Without long-term support, true innovative potential will
be missed along with the lack of the ability to scale in a meaningful way, especially to new
markets or customers.

Another barrier to consider is the inherent tension between transparency and accountability,
which are fundamental to the open-source ethos, and security vulnerabilities that can exist
with publicly visible code along with the resource challenge of security maintenance, updates,
patches, and the likelihood of breaking some parts of the code while updating others
(particularly in under-resourced environments).

Lastly, two other significant barriers to mention relate to licensing complexity and attribution.
Open-source developers often experience challenges pertaining to license compatibility
issues, intellectual property concerns, or legal uncertainty that can deter corporate adoption.
This, coupled with the difficulty in demonstrating return on investment and/or the financial
value of open-source contributions (despite being such an important component of the overall
digital infrastructure landscape) could be a barrier to corporate participation, adoption, and/or
scaling.

2. What is the added value of open-source for the public and private sectors?
Please provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in,
security, innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added
value.

It should be noted that open-source technologies are not a panacea. However, what is a
unique strength for these technologies is how they are typically governed, reflective of many
of Europeâs deepest values: democracy, consensus, cooperation, transparency, accountability,
openness to new ideas as well as disagreement, sustainability, inclusiveness, mutual support,
and innovation to name a few. Supporting open-source development is fundamentally aligned
with the ethos of the European Union project.

These governing values are also some of the most relevant added value for the public and
private sectors over other kinds of technology and their development processes. Although
closed-source or proprietary technologies are not inherently negative, when coupled with
dominant positions and significant lobbying power regularly exercised within and across the
critical digital infrastructure sector (as detailed in the Open Market Institute report,
âEngineering the Cloud Commons: Tackling Monopoly Control of Critical Digital Infrastructureâ
â
https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/publications/report-rethink-regulatory-approach-to-ess
ential-cloud), dependency on those technologies often limits the innovative potential that
comes with the open-source tech, an leads to the lack of consumer recourse for rising prices,
the ability to migrate to other providers (i.e., vendor lock-in), the risk of surveillance or denial of
access (as demonstrated by the case of the International Criminal Court and Microsoft â
https://www.ejiltalk.org/justice-recoded-why-it-matters-that-the-international-criminal-court-e
mbraced-open-source-software-and-ditched-microsoft/). In contrast, and especially with the
proper support, open-source technology â and its underlying governance mechanisms â can
help lower costs by, for instance, reducing licensing fees and increasing security by offering
the ability to audit code and algorithms â returning the power and responsibility to the users.

Additionally, crucial added value that open-source technology brings to both the public and the
private sectors is interoperability. This cannot be stressed enough, and is critical to promoting
sovereignty and resilience. Interoperability is one of the biggest antidotes to vendor lock-in
that promotes innovation, a level playing field, and consumer choice and independence. As
such, it should be actively prioritised and promoted since open standards, transparent
protocols, and community-driven development naturally foster interoperability in ways that
proprietary systems actively resist. Furthermore, interoperability and the open-source
governance principles go hand-in-hand.

Concrete examples of how the public and private sector within Europe have successfully
adopted open-source technologies and demonstrated its value continue to grow. They include
Schleswig-Holsteinâs âDeutschland-Stackâ vision for a digitally independent Germany and its
switch                                     to                                    Nextcloud
(https://nextcloud.com/blog/schleswig-holsteins-impulspapier-for-deutschland-stack-vision/),
the     Austrian    governmentâs    switch     to    Nextcloud       and    its ecosystem

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at the EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

(1) Expanding EU funding opportunities for open-source research and development (ranging
from grants and Horizon programmes, to tax incentives, infrastructure support, and
subsidies).

(2) Offering significantly streamlined and less burdensome administrative/bureaucratic
reporting for open-source communities (especially since many work on a voluntary basis) â
this may seem at odds with the EUâs robust accountability requirements, but flexible and tiered
reporting based on funding level, project maturity, community governance mechanisms, and
the type of entity to which the project is awarded (along with how big that particular projectâs
development community is) could help to alleviate it.

(3) Promoting and incentivising European open-source technologies within public
procurement processes, which could include offering preferential treatment or even mandates
for EU-based or EU-governed open-source solutions (particularly in sensitive sectors related to
national security, sovereignty, innovation, etc.).

(4) Supporting open-source development through legal, regulatory, and policy mechanisms,
specifically ones that advance public-interest principles within digital public infrastructure â
principles such as but not limited to (a) ensuring it is mission-driven; (b) being rooted in open
standards; (c) interoperable; (d) stakeholder inclusive; (e) environmentally sustainable; (f)
decentralised; (g) emphasising transparency and public accountability; (h) community-driven;
(i) secure and private by design; (j) inclusive of strong data governance and clear restrictions
on use by third-parties; and (k) promoting democratic principles, both in terms of design and
utility            (as               explained              in             this              post:
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cost-control-competition-journalisms-case-public-interest-j4c
ie/).

(5) Create and facilitate new markets, tech products/services, and/or business models for
open-source projects to be financially sustainable such as but not limited to improved tax
treatment for dual-licensing technologies, frameworks for professional support services,
procurement that values open-source companies, organisations, and projects, and incubators
and accelerators for open-source startups and SMEs. In-line with sustainability considerations
as it relates to finance and human capital, the EU could provide more financial and policy
support, particularly related to connecting existing initiatives and assessing their potential for
public use and scalability. This includes support for education, training, and workforce
development for open-source projects, as well as for âcommunity infrastructureâ such as
conferences and fora, translation services, documentation, mentorship, etc., which is
important for building and sustaining open-source communities across borders, languages,
generations, and markets in the long-term.

(6) Funding security audits, bug bounty programmes, and/or invest in independent, dedicated
security teams and help desks for critical open-source projects.

(7) Lastly, designating interoperability, at minimum, as a core feature of all digital technologies
adopted by the public sector would significantly boost the incentive to ensure private
sector-facing technology includes it as well since the revenue opportunity from public
procurement would justify the development investment while also facilitating new market
opportunities within the private sector by prioritising such technologies â all while ensuring
critical human rights safeguards are put in place.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

Technology priorities should be assessed across multiple strategic dimensions:

From a user sovereignty and daily impact perspective, cloud-based infrastructure and
services â including document editing, storage, collaboration tools, and communication
platforms â should be prioritised. These tools affect hundreds of millions of European users
daily and represent the areas of greatest vendor lock-in to non-EU proprietary systems.
Supporting open-source alternatives here directly addresses both consumer choice and data
sovereignty concerns while demonstrating tangible benefits to citizens.

From a critical infrastructure and security perspective, priorities should include operating
systems, databases, networking infrastructure, and cybersecurity tools that underpin public
services, healthcare systems, energy grids, and telecommunications. These foundational
technologies are essential to the EUâs technological sovereignty and resilience, and their
open-source nature enables security auditing and reduces dependency on external vendors
for critical systems.

From a digital public infrastructure perspective, technologies that enable interoperability, data
portability, and democratic governance should be prioritised as well. This includes identity
management systems, data exchange protocols, and platforms for public service delivery. As
mentioned in previous answers above, if technology is being implemented or mandated for
the public, the public should have a say in how it is developed and what principles govern it. As
such, open-source solutions are ideal for achieving this in practice.

From an innovation and competitiveness perspective, emerging technology areas like
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning frameworks, edge computing platforms,
quantum computing, and development tools should receive support to ensure Europe is not
locked out of future technology stacks and can compete globally while maintaining alignment
with European values around transparency, accountability, and ethical AI.

These priorities are interconnected; for example, secure foundational infrastructure enables
trustworthy public services and innovation, which, in turn, support everyday productivity and
collaboration.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open-source lead to increased
competitiveness and cyber resilience?

Cloud technologies for investigative journalism and public-interest causes â The
Brussels-based Global Forum for Media Development (GFMD) and the Amsterdam-based
Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) are actively working on is the
development of cloud technologies for the community of investigative journalism,
accountability research, and others working on public-interest causes via the Journalism
Cloud Alliance (JCA) (https://gfmd.info/cloud-alliance/).

The JCA is addressing the critical challenges faced by investigative journalism and data
newsrooms arising from the significant expenses and constraints associated with cloud
computing. Through collaboration, collective action, and strategic partnerships, we are making
cloud-based infrastructure and services more accessible, secure, affordable, and sustainable
for newsrooms and public-interest initiatives worldwide.

It exemplifies both the values of open-source and public-interest infrastructure reflected in our
above-mentioned responses, all while demonstrably adding value and supporting innovation
within the journalism ecosystem. Greater support for open-source ecosystems, digital
resilience, and sovereign tech in Europe would be significant for us, since the cost of cloud
infrastructure and services, control over journalistic data, technological self-determination,
and the ability to innovate in the public-interest are imperative â and since the open-source
culture that defined an earlier era of online journalism has collapsed
(https://newsproduct.org/blog/journalism-lost-its-culture-of-sharing-heres-how-we-rebuild-it).
It is, therefore, critical that we rebuild it, and now is our opportunity.
