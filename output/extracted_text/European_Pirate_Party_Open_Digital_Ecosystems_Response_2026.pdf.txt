European Pirate Party Response to the European Commissionâs Call for Evidence on the
Towards Open Digital Ecosystems Initiative

Executive Summary:

The European Pirate Party welcomes the Commissionâs Towards European Open Digital
Ecosystems initiative as a timely opportunity to place open source at the core of Europeâs
technological sovereignty. Open source should be recognised as public infrastructure that is
essential to transparency, cybersecurity, and democratic accountability. For this vision to
move beyond principle, the EU must act on four fronts: reform public procurement to
prioritise open standards, secure sustainable funding for maintenance and governance,
reduce structural dependence on non-EU infrastructure, and put safeguards in place against
open-washing and vendor capture. Without a coordinated EU-level approach, Europeâs
strong developer ecosystem will remain fragmented, rich in talent, but poor in strategic
autonomy and fair competition.

Who We Are

The European Pirate Party is a pan-European political movement represented at EU, national,
and local levels. We advocate for a digital society grounded in fundamental rights, democratic
control, transparency, and shared public value. Our political work focuses on digital rights,
technological sovereignty, civil liberties, open knowledge, and the protection of the commons
in the digital age.

For the European Pirate Party, technology is never neutral. Digital infrastructures shape
power, agency, and access and therefore, they must be designed, governed, and maintained
in the public interest.

What We Believe

We are committed to a digital Europe that is open, decentralised, and respects human rights.
We believe that Open-source software is a digital public good, essential for democratic
oversight, resilience, and user autonomy. We also believe that Interoperability and open
standards are prerequisites for real choice and fair competition. We assert that public money
should serve the public interest, not reinforce private dependency or extractive business
models. Additionally, we affirm that digital sovereignty means control over infrastructure,
governance, and knowledge, not merely geographic location of servers. Finally, we know and
believe that sustainable digital ecosystems depend on the people who build, maintain, and
govern them.

Against this backdrop, the European Pirate Party welcomes the Commissionâs invitation to
examine both the current state of the EU open-source ecosystem and the concrete actions
required at EU level to strengthen it. The Commissionâs initiative Towards European Open
Digital Ecosystems is a recognition that open source is central to the EUâs technological
sovereignty, cybersecurity, and competitiveness agenda. This consultation is timely as the
EUâs digital dependency on non-EU proprietary infrastructures is no longer an abstract
concern. It has become a structural risk affecting public administrations, critical services, and
democratic accountability. At the same time, Europe already hosts one of the worldâs richest
open-source communities yet, much of the value it creates is captured elsewhere.
The Open digital ecosystems enable transparency, reduce dependency on dominant non-EU
actors, and create space for European innovation that is both competitive and accountable.

Therefore, we are responding because this initiative presents a rare opportunity to move
beyond symbolic support for openness and address the structural conditions that determine
whether open source can scale, endure, and serve the public interest. Procurement practices,
funding models, governance frameworks, and infrastructure choices will decide whether
European open digital ecosystems remain peripheral or become foundational.

Opportunities and Risks in the Current Initiative

Key Opportunities

This initiative has the potential to mark a strategic shift in how the EU approaches open
source.

First, it can reframe open source as infrastructure, not merely as innovation input. By
recognising maintenance, governance, and deployment as core policy concerns, the
Commission can address long-standing sustainability gaps that research funding alone has
failed to solve.

Second, it offers a pathway to reduce structural dependencies on non-EU proprietary
ecosystems. Open digital ecosystems, if properly supported, can counter lock-in, improve
supply-chain transparency, and strengthen cybersecurity through verifiability and shared
responsibility.

Third, the initiative can level the playing field for European SMEs, start-ups, and community-
driven projects. By addressing barriers to procurement access, scaling, and market integration,
the EU can ensure that open source is not only developed in Europe, but also adopted and
sustained within European markets.

Finally, the initiative can help establish shared governance and trust frameworks. This ensures
that publicly supported open technologies remain genuinely open, community-governed, and
aligned with EU values.

Key Risks

Nevertheless, the initiative also poses, significant risks especially if it remains high-level or
narrowly framed.

One risk is that open source is treated primarily as a supporting tool for other policy objectives
(such as AI or cloud competitiveness), when it is a strategic ecosystem in its own right.
Without explicit attention to governance, maintenance, and community health, the same
dependency patterns may simply be reproduced on top of open code.

Another risk is open washing, where projects branded as âopenâ receive support despite
being effectively controlled by single vendors or designed to reinforce proprietary business
models. Without clear criteria and safeguards, public funding may unintentionally strengthen
market concentration rather than reduce it.

There is also a risk that procurement and deployment barriers are acknowledged but left to
member states, resulting in uneven implementation and limited real-world impact.
Fragmentation would undermine the very ecosystem approach the initiative seeks to
promote. Finally, if sustainability is addressed only through short-term funding or voluntary
commitments, the initiative may fail to provide the long-term stability that open digital
ecosystems require.

While Member States have launched a range of valuable open-source initiatives at national
level, uneven implementation risks fragmenting the European landscape. Divergent
procurement rules, infrastructure choices, and interoperability frameworks undermine
economies of scale and, more quietly, the very openness this initiative seeks to promote.
Without coordination, open source risks becoming a patchwork of national solutions rather
than a shared European asset. A coordinated EU approach can do what individual efforts
cannot. It can align standards, pool resources, and provide continuity beyond national
political cycles. Common governance frameworks and funding mechanisms would allow
local innovation to scale within a coherent, sovereign European digital space, ensuring that
open digital ecosystems function as European public goods.

Response to Consultation Questions

The following sections respond to the Commissionâs questions through four strategic anchors
that we consider essential to building genuinely open and sustainable digital ecosystems:

   â¢   Public procurement reform as the primary market-shaping lever

   â¢   Sustainability and maintenance funding for open digital commons

   â¢   Open, interoperable, EU-aligned infrastructure

   â¢   Governance safeguards against corporate capture and open-washing

Together, these anchors reflect both the opportunities identified above and the structural
barriers that continue to limit the EU open-source sectorâs full potential.

Question 1: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector, and what
barriers hamper adoption, maintenance, and sustainable contribution?

Strengths of the EU Open-Source Sector: The EU hosts one of the worldâs largest and most
skilled open-source developer communities, strongly aligned with European values of
transparency, privacy, and democratic governance. Europe benefits from a dense academic
and research ecosystem, which has produced widely used open-source projects through
initiatives such as the Next Generation Internet Initiative, the FIWARE framework, and
investments in RISC-V hardware and open-source vehicle platforms via the Chips Joint
Undertaking.

This cultural and institutional alignment gives the EU a strong foundation for developing
digital public goods rooted in openness and accountability.

Structural Weaknesses: Despite this strength, the EU faces a persistent value-extraction
imbalance: European communities create open technologies, while non-EU companies
disproportionately capture economic value. The sector remains fragmented across member
states, with uneven access to capital, professional support, and market visibility. Network
effects and incumbent advantages continue to favour proprietary vendors in both public
procurement and private markets, limiting the scalability of EU-based open-source initiatives.

Barriers to Adoption and Maintenance:

1.Procurement Barriers:

EU Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU contain structural biases that disadvantage
open-source solutions, despite their formal neutrality. As documented by the Free Software
Foundation Europe (FSFE) in the Public Money, Public Code campaign, the directives do not
mandate interoperability or open standards, allowing procurement templates to specify
proprietary formats and vendor-specific features. Qualification criteria frequently prioritise
commercial warranties and enterprise contracts, sidelining community-maintained projects
with established reliability.

Lifecycle costs including vendor lock-in, migration expenses, and exit strategies, are routinely
excluded from total cost of ownership assessments, as shown in OpenForum Europeâs
procurement analyses. The emphasis on upfront licensing fees creates false economies that
entrench long-term dependency, contradicting the directivesâ own efficiency principles.

Munichâs LiMux project illustrates both the potential and fragility of open-source adoption.
Between 2003 and 2013, the city migrated 15,000 desktops to Linux, saving â¬11.7 million and
achieving vendor independence. As the deputy project coordinator noted, âMicrosoft has
shown us what it means to be dependent on a vendor.â Political pressure and interoperability
constraints later drove a costly reversal, demonstrating how procurement ecosystems can
reproduce lock-in across organisations.

More recently, Germanyâs Centre for Digitalisation and IT Consolidation (ZenDiS) has
addressed these weaknesses by providing open-source infrastructure tailored to public
administration.

Barriers to Sustainable Contribution: EU funding programmes such as Horizon Europe and
the Digital Europe Programme prioritise innovation and prototyping over long-term
maintenance. This creates a recurring âvalley of deathâ once initial grants end. As
documented by Germanyâs Sovereign Tech Fund, many widely used open-source
components remain maintained by volunteers despite their critical role across economic and
public-sector infrastructure.

Community-governed projects also face limited recognition in academic and professional
contexts, legal uncertainty around liability, and few viable pathways to sustain openness
without compromising independence. These structural conditions discourage long-term
contribution and weaken the resilience of Europeâs open digital commons.
2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please provide
concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation,
among others) that are most important to assess the added value

The added value of open source for the public sector is the possibility of verifiable data
protection as well as privacy and sovereignty.

Open source provides the most transparent framework for achieving "data protection by design
and by default" as provided under Article 25 GDPR. In proprietary software, you have to take
a vendor's word that they aren't mishandling your data. With open source, the "many eyes"
theory suggests that security flaws and privacy leaks are more likely to be spotted and corrected
because the code is public.

Furthermore, it is significantly harder to hide secret data collection tools when the entire global
community can read the script. Under the GDPR, organisations must demonstrate that they
have implemented technical measures for data protection and open source provides a clear
"paper trail" of code that auditors can inspect directly. It also supports data privacy by default
because developers are allowed to modify software to strip out unnecessary data collection.
Finally, open source provides genuine control over critical infrastructure, free from foreign
jurisdictional constraints.

For government services, it enables public scrutiny of algorithmic decision-making,
strengthening democratic accountability. If a government uses an algorithm to decide who gets
a tax audit or a social benefit, that code should be as public as the law itself. Using open source
ensures that critical national infrastructure is not beholden to a single foreign company. If a
proprietary vendor decides to pull out of a market or change their terms, a government using
open source can simply maintain the code themselves. For example, under Article 69 of Italyâs
Digital Administration Code and the related AgID guidelines, public administrations that own
software developed on their specifications must publish its source code under an open license,
in a public repository and in the Developers Italia catalog, so that other administrations can
reuse it and avoid duplicative expenditure.

However, it is imperative to note that being open source does not mean the settings are private
by default. A developer could create an open-source tool that is incredibly invasive. The
difference is that you can see it happening and change it.

Now, for the private sector, the added value of open source is through cost and innovation.
Open source eliminates licensing fees, but its greatest economic advantage lies in avoiding
long-term lock-in costs. Organizations retain freedom to switch providers, or bring operations
in-house.

Open source provides shared building blocks reducing development costs, accelerating
innovation through common foundations. Example, companies like Spotify use open-source
building blocks (like the Linux kernel or Kubernetes) so they can focus their resources on the
features that actually make them money, rather than reinventing the wheel. Furthermore,
transparency enables independent security audits and immediate fixes rather than waiting for
vendor responses.
Key Factors for Assessing Added Value:

The added value of open source should be assessed against the following criteria:

   â¢   Security through auditability rather than vendor claims
   â¢   Lock-in risk, including migration costs and data portability
   â¢   Total cost of ownership, including exit strategiesânot licensing fees alone
   â¢   Sovereignty over data location, legal jurisdiction, and operational control

Taken together, these factors demonstrate that open source is a strategic tool for resilience,
accountability, and long-term public and economic value.

Question 3: What concrete EU-level measures could support the growth of the EU open-
source sector and strengthen technological sovereignty and cybersecurity?

To support the growth of the EU open-source sector and strengthen technological sovereignty
and cybersecurity, there needs to be public procurement reform, sustainable funding
mechanisms and governance safeguards and standards.

Proposed EU-Level Measures at a Glance:

   â¢   Amend public procurement directives to establish an Open Source First principle
       requiring justification for proprietary solutions.

   â¢   Create an EU Sovereign Tech Fund providing stable, multi-year maintenance and
       security funding.

   â¢   Define openness certification criteria to prevent open-washing and ensure transparent
       governance.

   â¢   Introduce proportional liability and compliance frameworks protecting open-source
       contributors and small community projects.

   â¢   Embed interoperability and exit strategies as mandatory procurement evaluation
       criteria to reduce dependency and lock-in.

1. Public Procurement Reform: Procurement is the EUâs most powerful lever for market
change. Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU should be amended to establish an âOpen
Source firstâ principle, requiring justification when proprietary solutions are chosen despite
viable open alternatives. Tender templates must prohibit brand-specific requirements and
rely on functional specifications grounded in open standards. Interoperability, data
portability, and exit strategies should be mandatory evaluation criteria, with lifecycle costs
explicitly included. FSFEâs Public Money, Public Code framework provides a clear legal and
policy foundation for these reforms.

2. Sustainable Funding Mechanisms: The EU should establish an EU-level Sovereign Tech
Fund, building on Germanyâs model (â¬24.6 million invested across 60+ projects). Funding
should prioritise maintenance, security audits, and infrastructure resilience, with direct
support to maintainers and multi-year commitments. Operational maintenance funding must
be separated from innovation grants within Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe
Programme. Structural support should also be provided to community-governed
foundations, drawing on the models of the Mozilla Foundation and Wikimedia Foundation.
3. Governance Safeguards and Standards

Public support must be conditional on genuine openness. Consequently, "European Open
Source" should require OSI-approved licenses, public repositories, open development with
community participation, transparent governance, and EU-based governance structures.
Open washing can be prevented by requiring that projects meet an objective openness criteria.

Additionally, open-source contribution should be integrated in education curricula. Fund
Open Source Program Offices in universities and public bodies should be adequately funded
and frameworks recognising open-source contribution in academic and professional
advancement, should be developed.

Finally, practical regulatory compliance guidance for open-source communities, should be
developed and designed to reduce the burden on small projects. Clarify liability frameworks
protecting individual contributors. Ensure that regulations such as the AI Act and Cyber
Resilience Act, include proportionate requirements for community projects.

Question 4: What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

Developer infrastructure should be the EUâs first priority. Europe remains structurally
dependent on non-EU platforms for hosting, building, and distributing codeâa vulnerability
highlighted in the European Parliamentâs 2025 report on software dependencies. This
dependence is operational as ENISA has identified software supply-chain attacks as among
the fastest-growing cybersecurity threats. Public procurement must therefore require
portability and verifiable build provenance, while EU funding should support federated, EU-
hosted developer services treated as digital public goods rather than commercial
conveniences.

Identity and authentication follow closely behind. Centralised user accounts controlled by
major platforms introduce avoidable risks to sovereignty and privacy. Open, federated
identity systems, based on standards such as OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0, align with
eIDAS 2.0 while preserving user agency. Their implementation should embed privacy-by-
design from the outset and avoid reproducing dependency through proprietary identity
providers.

Beyond these core layers, there is also cloud and edge computing which are essential for data
sovereignty. AI infrastructure must enable transparency and auditability, cybersecurity tools
should support verifiable security assurance, and communication networks must allow
privacy-preserving interoperability. Together, these elements form the infrastructural
backbone of a secure, sovereign European digital space.

Question 5: In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
competitiveness and cyber resilience?

Public administrations benefit first from transparency and interoperability. Open standards
reduce vendor dependence, enable solution reuse across jurisdictions, and ensure continuity
through independent security audits and rapid patching. Examples include Germany's
ZenDiS and France's SILL catalogue.
Healthcare systems gain resilience through portability and transparency. Open source
supports patient data portability and verifiable security governance which are both essential
for cross-border EU health data spaces and for defending against ransomware attacks.

Critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, transport, and water, strengthen their
security posture by relying on open, verifiable systems. These reduce exposure to foreign
control and mitigate risks embedded in proprietary dependencies.

Financial services and industrial sectors benefit through lower barriers and safer innovation.
Open compliance and payment tools increase competition in financial services while enabling
independent auditing. In manufacturing and automotive industries, shared open platforms
support secure innovation in Industry 4.0 and software-defined vehicles.

This pattern is consistent across different sectors. Open source lowers entry barriers, reduces
dependency costs, accelerates innovation, and strengthens cyber resilience through
transparency and collective security verification.

Conclusion

The European Pirate Party is a pan-European political movement committed to a digital
society grounded in fundamental rights, democratic control, transparency, and shared public
value. We believe that technology is never neutral and that digital infrastructures must be
designed, governed, and maintained in the public interest.

Our core convictions remain clear: open-source software is a digital public good essential for
democratic oversight and user autonomy. Interoperability and open standards are
prerequisites for genuine choice and fair competition. Public money must serve the public
interest, not reinforce private dependency. Digital sovereignty means control over
infrastructure, governance, and knowledge. Sustainable digital ecosystems depend
fundamentally on the people who build, maintain, and govern them.

This consultation presents significant opportunities that align directly with these principles.

First, procurement reform represents the most powerful lever available to the EU. By making
"Open Source First" binding rather than aspirational, requiring interoperability and exit
strategies, and accounting for total cost of ownership including lock-in risks, the Commission
can fundamentally reshape digital markets. Public Money, Public Code must become
enforceable policy, not symbolic aspiration.

Second, sustainable maintenance funding can address the critical gap that innovation
programmes have failed to solve. By establishing an EU Sovereign Tech Fund modelled on
Germany's success, the Commission can ensure that essential digital infrastructure receives
the long-term operational support it requires. Maintenance is not secondary workâit is public
infrastructure investment.

Third, infrastructure independence can reduce Europe's structural dependencies on non-EU
platforms for development, distribution, and operation. EU-hosted repositories, package
managers, CI/CD systems, and cloud infrastructure are not duplicative servicesâthey are
sovereign capacity for how Europe builds and distributes software.
Fourth, clear governance safeguards can prevent open-washing and ensure that public
funding builds genuinely open, community-governed ecosystems rather than reinforcing
vendor control. Transparent criteria, community participation rights, and enforceable
standards are essential.

These opportunities are not abstract. They determine whether European open digital
ecosystems can deliver on their promise of transparency, resilience, sovereignty, and
democratic accountabilityâor whether they remain peripheral to proprietary systems that
concentrate power and extract value.

The European Pirate Party stands ready to contribute our expertise and our commitment to
this transformation. We urge the Commission to move beyond symbolic support and
implement the structural changes that will determine whether this initiative succeeds.

The technical capacity exists. The community is ready. What is required is political will to
prioritize long-term sovereignty and public interest over short-term convenience and
incumbent relationships.

Europe can lead in demonstrating that digital sovereignty is achievable, that infrastructure
can serve democratic values, and that open ecosystems can deliver security, innovation, and
independence simultaneously. This consultation is the moment to make that choice.
