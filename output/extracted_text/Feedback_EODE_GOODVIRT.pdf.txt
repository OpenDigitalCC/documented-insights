Feedback for the European Commission â European Open Digital Ecosystems
1. Key Challenges for Open-Source Adoption in the EU
    â¢ Lack of Trust and Awareness: Private companies often hesitate to adopt European open-
      source solutions (e.g., Proxmox, Wazuh) due to concerns about long-term support, security,
      and compatibility, especially in an environment dominated by global players like Microsoft.
      The public sector could play a pivotal role as an early adopter, thereby increasing trust in
      these technologies.
    â¢ Dominance of Proprietary Solutions in Public Administration: The strong penetration of
      proprietary technologies (e.g., Microsoft) in public administration creates barriers for
      European open-source projects, preventing them from competing on equal termsâeven
      when they offer greater transparency, lower costs, and independence.
    â¢ Need for Standardization and Certification: There is a lack of EU-wide certification
      programs to validate the security and reliability of open-source solutions, which would
      facilitate their adoption in critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, and defense.
2. Added Value of Open Source for Public and Private Sectors
    â¢ Cost Efficiency and Independence: Open-source solutions like Proxmox VE and Wazuh
      reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and eliminate vendor lock-in, which is crucial for
      long-term sustainability and data control.
    â¢ Security and Transparency: The ability to audit source code and respond quickly to
      vulnerabilities enhances cyber resilience, particularly for critical infrastructure (energy,
      telecommunications, defense).
    â¢ Innovation and Flexibility: Community-driven development and open architecture enable
      faster innovation and customization to specific needs, providing an advantage over closed
      systems with lengthy release cycles.
3. Concrete EU-Level Measures
    â¢ Public Sector as a Catalyst: Public institutions should be encouraged (e.g., through
      legislation or funding) to prioritize open-source solutions where they are available and
      sustainable. This would create reference cases and boost confidence in the private sector.
    â¢ Financial and Educational Programs: EU-funded bootcamps and training for managing
      and deploying open-source infrastructure (e.g., Proxmox VE) would help address the skills
      gap.
    â¢ Standardization of Public Procurement: Open-source solutions should be considered on
      equal footing with proprietary products in public tenders, with clear criteria for evaluating
      their sustainability and security.
    â¢ Certification and Marketing Support: An EU-wide certification program for open-source
      security and promotion of successful European projects (e.g., Proxmox, Wazuh) as
      trustworthy alternatives would be beneficial.
4. Priority Sectors for Open-Source Support
    â¢ Public Administration: Deploying open-source virtualization and backup solutions (e.g.,
      Proxmox) for critical services would demonstrate their reliability and reduce dependence on
      foreign vendors.
    â¢ Healthcare and Finance: Isolated and auditable open-source platforms can ensure better
      protection of sensitive data and compliance with GDPR.
    â¢ Industry 4.0 and Telecommunications: Open-source virtualization and edge computing
      (e.g., Proxmox VE) enable flexible and secure management of production lines and 5G
      networks without vendor lock-in.
    â¢ Energy and Defense: Open-source solutions for SCADA and classified systems would
      enhance cyber resilience and EU independence.
5. Conclusion Europe has the potential to become a leader in open digital ecosystems, but this
requires coordinated support from the public sector, clear regulations, and investment in education
and certification. Only then can the current dominance of foreign technologies be overcome, and
EU technological sovereignty strengthened.
