Towards European Open Digital
Ecosystems
I am responding to this Call for Evidence based on more than 25 years of leadership and
participation in global open source communities, including sustained work with governments in
Europe, Canada, and the United States. I am not submitting on behalf of my employer, although I
work in the GovTech sector. I am CivicActionsâ Open Standards and Practices Lead.

My perspective is grounded in practical experience supporting open source adoption, public sector
procurement, accessibility compliance, and the long-term sustainability of digital public goods. I
have also been talking to government leaders around the world on their adoption of open source.

Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector
The European Union has one of the worldâs strongest open source ecosystems in terms of talent,
community participation, and alignment with public values. Europe has demonstrated its ability to
fund and nurture open, rights-respecting digital infrastructure.

However, significant weaknesses remain. These include:
  ââ Limited pathways for open source projects to scale beyond research and pilot phases.
  ââ Barriers to public procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises.
  ââ Over-reliance on complex and highly bureaucratic funding mechanisms that exclude
     individual maintainers and small teams.
  ââ Insufficient long-term funding for maintenance, governance, and security of critical open
     source infrastructure.

These weaknesses are structural rather than technical, and they can be addressed through
targeted policy and procurement reforms.

Added value of open source for the public sector
Open source delivers clear public value by reducing vendor lock-in, increasing transparency,
improving security through peer review, and enabling collaboration across institutions and
borders.
From an accessibility perspective, open source has been essential in helping governments
implement the Web Accessibility Directive and prepare for the European Accessibility Act. Shared
components, testing tools, and remediation practices significantly reduce duplication of effort
while improving compliance outcomes.

I am a Drupal Core Accessibility Maintainer, and much of my work over the past 15+ years has
directly supported government accessibility obligations in Europe and North America through
shared, open solutions rather than bespoke proprietary systems.

Policy measures to strengthen European open digital
ecosystems
Based on experience and discussions with global leaders, I recommend the following policy
measures at EU level.

Support the EU Sovereign Tech Fund
The EU Sovereign Tech Fund is a critical instrument for sustaining the open source foundations on
which both public and private digital systems depend. Funding should prioritize core
infrastructure, security maintenance, and governance rather than short-term innovation projects.
We do need to build on what has been done already by the German Sovereign Tech Agency. It is
important to have bodies that can help fund long-term strategically important pieces of digital
infrastructure.

Keep funding mechanisms proportionate and accessible
The Government of Canada provides a cautionary example. Despite early leadership in open
source adoption, the lack of procurement reform limited impact. In contrast, the Government of
British Columbia has successfully used micro-procurements to build a diverse GovTech ecosystem
of small firms contributing to shared open source solutions. This has allowed the BC government
to innovate on topics like digital identity.

EU funding instruments should adopt similarly targeted approaches where possible. This approach
better supports modern agile software development, and encourages greater vendor
accountability. For more information on procurement reform:

Embed open source in procurement policy
The United States government has made substantial indirect contributions to global open source
ecosystems through small business set-asides and federal contracting. These mechanisms have
enabled small and medium-sized enterprises to collaborate on large-scale public sector systems
while contributing back to the commons.

Europe can replicate this success by explicitly favouring procurement models that:
   ââ Support consortia of small firms.
   ââ Require contribution back to upstream open source projects.
   ââ Avoid structural dependence on single vendors.

I recently presented on this topic at FOSDEM, focusing on how procurement policy can
meaningfully support public code and digital commons:

Open source is global, and sovereignty must reflect that
reality
Open source ecosystems are inherently global. Europeâs technological sovereignty should be
pursued through leadership and participation in global communities, not through isolation or
regional fragmentation. Europe does not need to replicate Silicon Valley.

The values that have given rise to the big US Tech Giants are short-term and very libertarian. They
have resulted in much of the current crisis in the USA, and should not be emulated.

The most resilient digital ecosystems are those that combine:
   ââ Global collaboration and shared maintenance.
   ââ Local economic participation and skills development.
   ââ Procurement models that favour small and medium-sized enterprises contributing to
      shared infrastructure.

This approach aligns well with the Commissionâs objectives around competitiveness,
cybersecurity, and resilience.

Involving open source communities directly in policy
design
Policies designed without direct involvement of open source maintainers, foundations, and small
companies risk being ineffective in practice.

I serve on the board of the Digital Services Coalition, where I regularly see small and medium-sized
enterprises collaborate successfully on large public sector projects that no single firm could
deliver alone. This collaborative model is enabled by open source and appropriate procurement
frameworks.

Collectively, our coalition is able to provide guidance to government policymakers which are quite
distinct from the voices of the Big Four accounting firms which dominate government
decision-making. As an example, today, our coalition is providing feedback on the revolutionary
revision of the US Governmentâs Federal Acquisition Regulation. This will be attempting to
incorporate outcomes-based approaches to contracting.

The Commission should ensure that open source communities and small businesses are not
merely consulted, but actively involved in shaping implementation mechanisms.

Concluding observation
Europe has an opportunity to demonstrate global leadership by thinking globally and acting
locally: investing in shared open source infrastructure while structuring procurement and funding
policies that grow European skills, companies, and resilience.

If successful, this approach would not only strengthen Europeâs digital ecosystem, but also provide
a model that governments such as Canada have so far struggled to implement consistently.
