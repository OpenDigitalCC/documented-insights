   Strengthening EU digital sovereignty by ending discrimination against open source and
                                       enforcing existing law

--- 1. General support for the initiative

I strongly welcome the âEuropean Open Digital Ecosystem Strategyâ as a long-overdue step to
secure EU technological sovereignty. As an entrepreneur active in IT since 1995 and in agriculture
since 2003, I have consistently supported free/libre and open source software (FLOSS) as an
alternative to proprietary solutions controlled by companies subject to the US Cloud Act. If the EU
wants real digital sovereignty, it should begin by ending the structural discrimination that open
source users and developers currently face in the EU market.

--- 2. Stop tied sales of proprietary operating systems on PCs

A first, obvious measure is to end the systematic tying of proprietary operating systems (mainly
Microsoft Windows) to almost all PCs sold in the EU. - Today, around 99% of PCs offered to
consumers in the EU are sold with a pre-installed proprietary OS, with no practical option to refuse
the OS and no transparent price signal. - Consumers should always be able to: - Refuse the
proposed OS licence, - Buy the same hardware without an OS licence, - See clearly separated prices
for hardware, OS licence, and any bundle. This is not technically complicated: - Retailers could
simply keep the OS unactivated and not provide a licence key when the OS is refused. - No
uninstallation is needed; the consumer just does not pay for the licence and cannot activate it. - As
with a 5kg bag of carrots where both total price and price per kilo must be displayed, the OS licence
price and the hardware price should both be displayed, including for a â¬500ââ¬2,500 computer.
Linked sales of this kind are not tolerated in other markets in the EU internal market; it is difficult
to find another example where such de facto forced bundling is accepted. Enforcing basic
competition and consumer law here would be a cost-free and powerful step towards digital
sovereignty.

--- 3. Enforce the software exclusion: eradicate software patents in Europe

A second essential measure is to bring the European Patent Office (EPO) back in line with the
European Patent Convention (EPC) and to give legal certainty that software as such is not
patentable in Europe. - The EPC clearly provides that software, like literary works, is protected by
copyright, not by patents. - The EPOâs practice of granting âcomputer-implemented inventionâ
patents is, in substance, an attempt to bypass this rule. If âsoftware implemented on a computerâ is
patentable, then âa novel text implemented in a bookâ could also be treated as a patentable
invention, which is absurd. The current drift towards software patents creates a permanent threat
over open source developers: - A single court decision aligned with the EPOâs practice could be
used as a âkill switchâ against open source projects using standard algorithms or interfaces. - The
push by US-based closed-source lobbies (backed by some EU corporate allies) for a highly
centralised patent court increases this risk: convincing a small number of judges in one central court
is far easier than trying to convince many national courts that the EPC should be re-interpreted
against its clear wording and intention. The EU should: state unambiguously that software as such is
not patentable under EU law and that the EPO will cease its malpractice. It should then publicise
that developing open-source software in the EU is safe, and that developers are protected from
patent lawyers funded by GAFAM or by patent trolls, thereby attracting more major open-source
players to Europe.

--- 4. Going further

These two measures require no funding and no complex implementation; they are simply a
straightforward application of the relevant laws and conventions that safeguard free competition in
a free market. In genuinely free markets, Linux is the standard (it runs on 100% of the Top500
supercomputers and over 96% of the top one million web servers) because, in addition to being a
sovereign choice, Linux is more efficient, free of charge, more secure, less demanding in terms of
hardware, and easier to administer at scale. These two steps merely end the current bias in favour of
closed, proprietary software subject to foreign legal control. If you wished to go further and actively
promote open source and digital sovereignty, here are a few ideas: phase out proprietary software in
EU institutions, stop using non-interoperable file formats, and require hardware manufacturers to
allow purchasers full control over their devices if they so choose (in particular Android or iOS
devices once they no longer receive updates).

--- 5. Ready to help

I am an engineer (graduated from Polytechnique Brussels and Mons), owner of several companies
mainly in IT and agriculture, and I am ready to meet anyone in the EU institutions who is genuinely
interested in ending discrimination against open-source, sovereign solutions in favour of US or
Chinese closed solutions. I have time and passion backed by my technical and business experience
ready to help. I speak French, English (with a strong accent), and a few words of Dutch and Italian.
Thank you so much for finally showing some interest in defending EU interests rather than US
GAFAM profits. You should come and see what happens at FOSDEM in Brussels. Forza Europe!
