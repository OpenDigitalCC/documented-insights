About Nivenly
Nivenly's mission is to support underrepresented technologists through democratic governance and open source infrastructure. As part of our ongoing organizational development,
we have recently re-assessed which jurisdiction would best support this work. Nivenly is the legal entity for the Hachyderm Mastodon instance, which is the 14th largest instance on
the Fediverse with ~10k monthly active users.

Why We're Responding To This CfE
The US federal funding landscape for open source software has shifted in 2025. New grant conditions now extend beyond specific funded projects to cover all organizational
activities. Several foundations, including the Python Software Foundation and The Carpentries, have withdrawn from NSF funding rather than accept terms that conflicted with their
missions. Current federal funding requirements do not align with Nivenly's operational model. This is a strategic consideration rather than a barrierâNivenly has not relied on federal
fundingâbut it factors into our long-term planning.

The European Union has moved in a different direction, expanding investment in open source infrastructure while maintaining diversity and inclusion as policy priorities. Germany's
Sovereign Tech Fund has issued significant grants to foundations including GNOME. NLnet and Next Generation Internet programs continue funding ecosystem work. The EU's
European Diversity Charters, European Diversity Month, and Women in Digital initiatives reflect an institutional commitment to inclusive technology development. The EU Cyber
Resilience Act formally recognizes "open source stewards" and creates demand for governance and security work. For organizations whose missions include supporting
underrepresented communities, EU funding mechanisms appear to be increasingly accessible.

Given these factors, Nivenly is evaluating European jurisdiction as part of our organizational development. This reflects a strategic assessment of where we can best serve our
community and sustain our mission.

Barriers To Moving To Europe
As soon as we began this evaluation, a fundamental challenge presented itself immediately: unlike the United States, the European Union lacks a harmonized corporate or non-profit
structure. Thus, any migration pathway for a US-based open source software foundation like us begins with a search for favorable European jurisdictions into which to incorporate.

Two major foundations have established EU entities: the Eclipse Foundation and the Linux Foundation. We chose to focus on Eclipse's approach, as Eclipse executed a full
migration rather than establishing a subsidiary entity. Our desired end state mirrors theirs: a single European organization.

Our initial strategy was to leverage existing precedent to reduce the scope of research required. Rather than evaluating every available non-profit structure across multiple
jurisdictions, we intended to adopt a proven model and adapt it to our needs.

This approach proved unsuitable for an organization of our scale. The Belgian AISBL structure that serves Eclipse well carries legal and accounting overhead that is disproportionate
for a smaller foundation. Once the AISBL was ruled out, we found ourselves conducting the broader research we had hoped to avoidâmapping the legal landscape across European
jurisdictions and evaluating various non-profit entity types against our organizational requirements.

How The Commission Can Help
The primary challenge we have encountered is navigating jurisdictional complexity in an unfamiliar landscape. Understanding the various legal entity types available in each country
âtheir regulatory requirements, governance implications, and operational constraintsâand then mapping these against Nivenly's existing structure to identify a suitable match has
proven extraordinarily time-intensive.

Legal expertise in this domain is similarly difficult to access. Building relationships with attorneys who specialize in open source foundation law under European jurisdictions requires
significant time and financial investment. The fragmented nature of European law compounds this challenge: counsel qualified to advise on Belgian AISBL formation cannot advise
on German structures such as a Stiftung (as used by The Document Foundation) or GmbH (as used by Mastodon gGmbH and the Sovereign Tech Agency).

This dynamic creates a resource asymmetry. Large organizations can dedicate substantial resources to solving their individual needs. Smaller entities must crowdsource knowledge
and expertise to achieve equivalent outcomesâyet no centralized resource currently exists to facilitate this.

Several interventions would meaningfully address these barriers.

First, the Commission could develop guidance specifically for open source projects and foundations navigating European legal structures. This guidance should identify which entity
typesâboth non-profit and for-profitâare relevant to the ecosystem, specify which jurisdictions offer them, and outline applicable regulations. The guidance should be graduated in
scope, addressing the needs of single-project entities through large foundations managing project portfolios. It should also include the nuanced differences between these types as
they vary by country in ways that can be significant.

Critically, this guidance should include estimated costs for establishing each entity type. Budget-constrained projects and smaller foundations could then make informed decisions
and proceed with confidence, rather than depleting limited resources on exploratory legal consultations.

Second, the Commission could support the development of umbrella legal entities designed for open source. Such structures would reduce barriers to entry for emerging projects
and communities in Europe. Given that open source development is inherently internationalâcontributors and maintainers are distributed globallyâumbrella organizations align
naturally with how this ecosystem actually functions.
