Why It Is Necessary to Talk About Digital Citizen
Sovereignty Today
For 25 years, FundaciÃ³n Cibervoluntarios has been working to help thousands
of people turn technology into a tool for transforming their lives. This is what
technological appropriation means: moving from being passive beneficiaries
to becoming active protagonists. Because appropriating the digital world is
not just about learning how to use a toolâit is about participating, contributing
ideas, communicating, defending your rights, and accessing new opportunities.
In short, it is about empowerment.

Over all these years, one key idea has become clear: being connected is not
enough. Having access to the Internet or knowing how to use a smartphone
is not sufficient if, at the same time, citizens cannot make decisions, do not
understand how technology works, and have no voice in shaping the rules of
the digital world. FundaciÃ³n Cibervoluntarios leads the process of the Collective
Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty, a collaborative effort that has
involved the active participation of more than 500 people from different
countries, professions, and levels of digital knowledge. Through this open and
plural dialogue, ten core principles have been defined, establishing a shared
starting point to continue moving forward and strengthening our rights online.
These principles are rooted in the experience, knowledge, and commitment of
all those who have contributed to building a shared vision of the role of citizens
in the digital environment.

  There is a clear need to raise our voices collectively and to
  promote a framework that puts people at the center of the
  digital ecosystem.

The Declaration highlights the importance of strengthening our place on
the Internet and collectively building the foundations of digital citizen
sovereigntyâone that guarantees our opportunities, freedoms, and rights. This
goal can only be achieved if we continue to build commitment, reflection, and
shared knowledge, recognizing that every person can contribute from their own
experience to move toward a fairer, more inclusive Internet that truly serves
society.

This is where the process begins: the creation of a Collective Declaration for
Digital Citizen Sovereignty (CDDC). Its goal is simple to state, yet ambitious
to achieve: to ensure that technology is conceived, designed, and used with
people and their rights at its core.

This process brings together the journey taken so far, the methodologies
used, andâabove allâthe shared learnings and principles that have made it
possible to reach a Declaration that is not just another theoretical text, but a
lever for collective transformation.

Beyond digital inclusion: digital sovereignty
For years, the focus was on closing the basic digital divide:

  â¢   Who has access to the internet?
  â¢   Who knows how to use a computer or a smartphone?
  â¢   Who can complete an online administrative procedure?

Today, however, the challenge goes much further. The digital environment is
the space where key decisions are made:

  â¢   Which technologies are developed
  â¢   For what purposes
  â¢   What data is collected and how it is used
  â¢   What rules shape the relationship between citizens, governments, and
      companies

  People are not just âusersâ: we are rights holders in the
  digital environment

In this context, Digital Citizen Sovereignty emerges as a response to three
underlying structural challenges:

  1. The concentration of technological power in the hands of a small number
     of global actors.
  2. The lack of transparency around data use and the functioning of
     algorithms and digital platforms.
  3. The growing asymmetry between the knowledge and decision-making
     power of these actors and that of the broader public.

  The Collective Declaration aims to go one step further: not
  only to reduce digital divides, but to redistribute power,
  strengthen rights, and open up real spaces for participation
  in the design of the digital ecosystem.

Toward the Collective Declaration in Four Steps
The study underpinning this Declaration was designed with a clear premise:

  If we are talking about Digital Citizen Sovereignty, the
  process itself must also be sovereign and citizen-driven.

That is why the approach combines qualitative and quantitative methodologies,
with an iterative, multi-stakeholder perspective and a strong emphasis on co-
creation. It is an open, rigorous, and participatory process structured around
four main steps:

  4. Qualitativeâquantitative sampling
  5. Co-creation sessions
  6. Facilitated synthesis and the construction of shared meaning
  7. Collective selection of the principles of the Declaration

All of this took place within the framework of EmpoderaLIVE 2025, now
established as a benchmark event in civic technology, leading the debate
on how to guarantee our rights in the digital age. Throughout the process,
there has been ongoing dialogue with experts, citizens, tech volunteers, social
organisations, public administrations, companies, and academia.

Step 1 / Listening Before Defining: QualitativeâQuantitative
Sampling

Before collectively defining âDigital Citizen Sovereignty,â it was essential to
listen to all participants. To do so, a questionnaire was designed as the initial
research tool, making it possible to gather both:

â¢ Quantitative data: perceptions, priorities, and levels of concern
â¢ Qualitative data: fears, expectations, proposals, and concrete examples

The work was carried out with three distinct groups:

  1. Speakers from several editions of EmpoderaLIVE

  Experts with a global track record in key fields such as digital rights,
  data governance, artificial intelligence, citizen participation, philosophy,
  journalism, digital activism, ethical hacking, open-source software, and
  social innovation, among others.

                                             6
                   Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty

      Objective: to build a shared theoretical framework around
      Digital Citizen Sovereignty (DCS).

  2. EmpoderaLIVE participants

  Profiles familiar with the work of FundaciÃ³n Cibervoluntarios and actively
  engaged with technology as a tool for social change.

      Objective: to connect the theoretical framework with
      practical experience and the real-world use of digital tools.

  3. Spanish citizens

  People with a wide range of everyday experiences related to technology,
  including the use of digital public services, social media, apps, and online
  content.

      Objective: to incorporate a plural and inclusive voice,
      beyond expert environments.

Although the emphasis and language varied depending on the group, all
research instruments shared the same underlying idea: this was not only about
âdefiningâ Digital Citizen Sovereignty, but about translating it into concrete
practices, priorities, and training needs.

Step 2 / Co-creating the Concept: Participatory Sessions and
Structured Debate

Building on the sampling results, the process moved into a second phase:
collectively shaping the meaning of Digital Citizen Sovereignty and exploring
what it means in practice.

Two types of sessions were organised:

  â¢   Digital Citizen Sovereignty as a multidimensional concept

  The World CafÃ© format was used, a widely recognised methodology for
  collective intelligence processes. The session was structured around five
  thematic axes, which became the pillars of the analysis:

                                            7
                      Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty

  4. Transparency
  5. Digital life
  6. Data
  7. Agency
  8. Equality of opportunity

Each table brought together a diverse mix of participants:

 â¢     One expert speaker
 â¢     One facilitator
 â¢     Two citizen representatives
 â¢     One public administration representative
 â¢     One academic

Every 20 minutes, participants moved to a different table, connecting debates
and bringing different perspectives together. The outcome was a rich map of
barriers, solutions, and key stakeholders for each axis.

  â¢    Trustworthy AI: preventing AI from overshadowing the broader debate

Public debate around technology is currently dominated by Artificial Intelligence
(AI). To ensure that AI did not overshadow the wider reflection on Digital Citizen
Sovereignty, a dedicated space was designed to focus specifically on building
trustworthy AI from a European perspective, while remaining distinct from the
broader SDC discussion.

     AI can only be considered trustworthy if it puts people firstâ
     not innovation at any cost.

An adapted version of the Q-sort methodology was used, applied across four
institutional scenarios:

  â¢    Public administration
  â¢    Civil society
  â¢    Companies
  â¢    Academia

Within each setting, arguments were analysed across three ELSA dimensions:

  â¢    Ethical (responsibility, fairness, human agency)
  â¢    Legal (obligations, safeguards)
  â¢    Social (inclusion, accessibility, distributive effects)

Participants were asked to prioritise the arguments, identifying which
were essential, which were important, and which were neutral or even
counterproductive. This made it possible to clearly identify areas of consensus
as well as points of tension.

                                               8
                    Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty

Step 3 / Turning Many Voices into a Shared Narrative

Following the co-creation sessions, a key phase began: facilitated synthesis.
This was not simply about âsummarisingâ what had taken place, but about:

  â¢   Bringing into dialogue the outcomes of the thematic tables (digital life,
      transparency, data, agency, equality) with the results of the trustworthy
      AI exercise.
  â¢   Identifying cross-cutting patterns, areas of agreement, and points of
      tension.
  â¢   Transforming dispersed ideas into a coherent set of principles.

To achieve this, the full facilitation team came together in a âcollective
sensemakingâ session. Their role was not only technical, but also interpretative:
reading interactions, capturing nuances, and ensuring that complexity was not
lost.

The outcome was the identification of nine major shared elements, which
were later developed into ten principlesâor ârecitalsââof the Collective
Declaration. This step was essential to ensure that the Declaration:

  â¢   Truly reflects what emerged during the co-creation process.
  â¢   Has a clear and communicative structure capable of reaching diverse
      audiences.
  â¢   Preserves the participatory legitimacy of its origins.

Step 4 / A Truly Collective Declaration: Public Selection

Once the ten principles of the Declaration had been drafted, a new phase
began: testing them with the community itself.

Three versions of the same principles were presented, with differences in
language and emphasis tailored to:

  â¢   Citizens
  â¢   Academia
  â¢   Government

Participants at EmpoderaLIVE 2025 were invited to vote and select the
formulations they found most appropriate, clear, and motivating. Average
participation was 46 people, which made it possible to:

  â¢   Compare how the same principles are interpreted from different
      perspectives.
  â¢   Identify discursive tensions between more technical, more political, and
      more citizen-oriented language.

                                             9
                      Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty

  â¢   Ensure that the final text of the Declaration reflects a collective preference,
      not just the voice of the drafting team.

  The Collective Declaration for DCS presented here is
  the result of this deliberative process: a combination
  of conceptual rigour, diversity of perspectives, and
  democratic selection.

Results of a Collective Co-creation Effort
Key Insights from the Five Thematic Pillars of Digital Citizen Sovereignty

  1. TRANSPARENCY
  Open, accessible, comparable, verifiable, and non-
  manipulated information
Transparency is perceived as something that is felt more through its absence
than its presence. It is commonly associated with:

  â¢   Clarity
  â¢   Traceability
  â¢   The transfer of information

However, the debate also highlighted a key tension:

How far can transparency go without putting peopleâs privacy at risk?

Barriers identified

  â¢   Political and economic interests that hinder openness.
  â¢   Difficulties in verifying information.
  â¢   Lack of knowledge to understand legal texts and terms of use.
  â¢   Inaccessible language and the use of âdark patternsâ in platform design.

Proposed solutions

  â¢   Digital literacy and education as a foundation.
  â¢   Clear regulatory frameworks that enforce transparency.
  â¢   Access to open, verifiable, comparable, and non-manipulated information.
  â¢   The creation of ethics committees and mechanisms that allow technical
      teams to flag risks.

Key stakeholders: governments, technology companies, citizens, the education
community, the media, and developers.

                      Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty

  2. DIGITAL LIFE
  Itâs not about technology, itâs about peopleâs lives

  Participants agreed that digital life is not a separate layer,
  but an inseparable part of everyday life.

There is broad consensus that digital life is âeverywhereââthat it is âlife lived
through devicesââand that almost all aspects of life now pass through the
digital realm, even though people do not feel they have full control over that
space.

âYou donât break itâthe phone is my lifeâ This phrase was repeatedly used
as a symbol of that fusion. Defining what âdigital lifeâ is feels relatively easy.
Defining what a ânon-digital lifeâ would be is far more difficult.

Barriers identified

  â¢   The absence of clearly defined rights in online spaces.
  â¢   The speed of technological change versus the slow pace of regulation.
  â¢   A generational gap in knowledge and usage.
  â¢   Lack of control over who knows what, who decides what, and how our
      data is used.
  â¢   Growing distrust resulting from this lack of control.

Proposed solutions

  â¢   More education in digital skills for all ages.
  â¢   Reducing the generational gap in the use of technology.
  â¢   Regulatory frameworks that provide real security and protection.
  â¢   Safe spaces to store and manage personal information.

Key stakeholders: Among younger people, private companies are seen as the
main actors; among older people, governments and public institutions play a
central role. This difference in perception is particularly relevant for advocacy
and policy strategies.

  3. DATA: from âowningâ to âcontrollingâ
One of the most powerful discussions focused on data. The shared conclusion
can be summed up as follows:

                                               11
                      Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty

  Data ownership matters less than the real control people
  have over their data.

Two main types of data were identified:

  â¢   Personal data consciously provided by individuals.
  â¢   Behavioural data generated through online activity (clicks, usage time,
      movements, etc.).

The discussion also highlighted the importance of considering:

  â¢   Cultural factors and worldviews.
  â¢   The distinction between privacy and intimacy.

Barriers identified

  â¢   Data monopolies held by major digital platforms.
  â¢   The difficulty of revoking access once data has been shared.
  â¢   Lack of traceability: people do not know where their data is or how it is
      being used.
  â¢   Inconsistencies between technical standards and legal frameworks.
  â¢   The vulnerability of individuals in relation to actors that simultaneously
      define standards and policies.

Proposed solutions

  â¢   Decentralisation of data systems.
  â¢   Interoperability and open, shared protocols.
  â¢   Public access to infrastructure and open data spaces.
  â¢   Holistic data education: what data is, how it is used, and the risks it entails.
  â¢   Traceability as a prerequisite for accountability.

Key stakeholders

  â¢   The European Union and local authorities as key actors in breaking data
      monopolies.
  â¢   Major platforms (Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.) as actors with structural
      power.
  â¢   Academia as a space capable of driving regulatory coherence and fairer
      standards.

   4. AGENCY
   From âusersâ to digital citizenship

Agency refers to peopleâs real ability to make informed decisions and retain
room for manoeuvre in the digital environment. It is associated with:

  â¢   Extending the same rights that exist in the physical world into the digital
      space.
  â¢   Being able to accept or reject terms of use.
  â¢   Choosing between platforms.
  â¢   Moving from one service to another without losing everything.

Agency is closely linked to democracy, privacy, freedom of expression, and
collective responsibility. If technology makes decisions for us, there can be
no full citizenship.

Barriers identified

  â¢ Lack of education in:
  		       Â· Critical thinking
  		       Â· Basic legal knowledge
  â¢ How algorithms work.
  â¢ Insufficient public investment in infrastructure and training.
  â¢ Lack of diversity among those who design and govern technologies.
  â¢ Absence of accessible open data.

Proposed solutions

  â¢   Simplifying and making platform terms of use more flexible.
  â¢   Strengthening education that combines technical skills with ethics and
      critical thinking.
  â¢   Promoting free software, open source, and open data.
  â¢   Creating public AI infrastructures and shared digital spaces.
  â¢   Shifting perspectives: from passive âusersâ to political actors in the digital
      environment.

Key stakeholders: governments, companies, citizens, and educational
institutions working together at local, regional, national, and international levels.

   5. EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY
   Not a matter of justice, but of equity

When equal opportunities in the digital environment are discussed, the focus
often turns to:

                                              13
                      Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty

  â¢   Access to technology and information.
  â¢   Equal rights, including the right to be forgotten.
  â¢   Recognition of highly diverse social, historical, and cultural contexts.

Barriers identified

  â¢   Educational and knowledge inequalities.
  â¢   Gender, racial, and other biases embedded in algorithms and systems.
  â¢   The rapid pace of technological change, which leaves many people
      behind.
  â¢   Complex, unintuitive, and exclusionary interfaces.

Proposed solutions

  â¢   Critical digital literacy for the entire population, without age-based bias.
  â¢   Avoiding training approaches that focus only on âtarget groupsâ instead
      of society as a whole.
  â¢   Designing technological alternatives adapted to diverse needs: disability,
      rural contexts, educational levels, and more.

Key stakeholders: Schools, third-sector organisations, major technology
companies, and public administrations share responsibility for reducing
inequalities.

  The divide is no longer only about access, but about power
  and decision-making capacity.

What Citizens Tell Us About Trustworthy AI
The Q-sort exercise on trustworthy AI points to three main conclusions:

  1. A pragmatic consensus in favour of innovation

      â¢ Innovation is seen as essential, particularly in the business sector.
      â¢ Ethical and legal safeguards are accepted as long as they are not
        perceived as excessive barriers to technological adoption or as empty
        bureaucracy.

  2. Citizens want tangible protections, not just broad legal frameworks

      â¢ Concrete measures are valued, such as the labelling of AI-generated
        or AI-modified content.
      â¢ There is particular concern about reducing digital divides and ensuring
        real access and understanding.
      â¢ A certain level of distrust towards institutions emerges when they are

                                              14
                    Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty

       not perceived as capable of enforcing the rules.

  3. Academia reflects diverse agendas

     â¢ Some prioritise algorithmic justice (avoiding bias and discrimination).
     â¢ Others focus on user transfer and practical usefulness.
     â¢ Others place greater emphasis on promoting innovation.
     â¢ The risk-based approach raises mixed views: it is seen as useful, but also
       as potentially restrictive for research.

From an ELSA perspective, ethical and social dimensions clearly emerge as
priorities, while the legal dimension is accepted when it enables action and
questioned when it merely adds complexity.

Shared Elements Underpinning the Collective
Declaration
From the overall synthesis process, nine shared elements emerged, later
transformed into the ten principles of the Collective Declaration. Presented in
communicative terms, these elements are:

  1. Education and knowledge
     â¢ Not only technical training, but also values, ethics, critical thinking, and
       an understanding of rights.

  2. Access and adaptability for all
     â¢ Technologies and content that are accessible, understandable, and
       adapted to diverse contexts and cultures.

  3. Questioning technological determinism
     â¢ Technology cannot be framed as inevitable.
     â¢ We must recover the question of what makes us human and which
       decisions should not be delegated to machines.

  4. Co-governance and connection between actors
     â¢ Governments, companies, academia, and civil society must collaborate.
     â¢ There can be no citizen sovereignty without real spaces for participation.

  5. Open, shared, and transparent information
     â¢ The open movement (open data, open source, open access) as a
       foundation for accountability.

  6. Decentralisation and institutional accountability
     â¢ Avoiding concentrations of technological power.
     â¢ Ensuring that institutions assume their responsibilities at all levels.

                                            15
                   Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty

  7. Ethics as a cross-cutting principle
     â¢ Not as a final add-on, but as a guiding thread in every decision related
       to the design, use, and regulation of technology.

  8. Balancing individual and collective interests
     â¢ Recognising individual rights while also safeguarding the common good
       in the digital environment.

  9. Continuity between physical and digital spaces
     â¢ Understanding online and offline worlds not as separate realities, but as
       interconnected spaces.

From the combination and expansion of these points, a tenth principle emerges,
centred on active participation and shared responsibility:

  Digital sovereignty is not a state, but a process that requires
  ongoing commitment and collective action.

Next Steps: Toward Concrete Roadmaps
Building on the Declaration, FundaciÃ³n Cibervoluntarios commits to developing
specific roadmaps for each line of action, including:

  â¢   Concrete actions
  â¢   Strategic partnerships (âtravel companionsâ)
  â¢   Monitoring and evaluation indicators

This process will be supported by three methodological pillars:

  1. People-centred approach (User-Centric Approach, UCA)
     â¢ Understanding usersâ needs, goals, and contexts.
     â¢ Involving them at every stage: design, implementation, and evaluation.

  2. Quadruple Helix Collaboration (QHC)
     â¢ Structured collaboration between:
  		        Â· Public administration and the public sector
  		        Â· Industry and companies
  		        Â· Academia
  		        Â· Civil society and organised citizenship

  3. Action Research
     â¢ Researching while acting.
     â¢ Adapting tools and programmes based on insights generated through
       the process itself.
     â¢ Documenting best practices and sharing them openly.

An Invitation to Join This Evolving Process
The Collective Declaration for Digital Citizen Sovereignty is the result of an
evolving process that will continue to grow. The research report demonstrates
this clearly: when spaces for co-creation and listening are created, citizens
respond with clarity, nuance, and concrete proposals.

This document is not only a summary of the study. It is also an invitation:

  â¢   To media outlets seeking to address technology through a lens of rights
      and social justice.
  â¢   To institutions and public decision-makers looking for frameworks to
      design more democratic digital policies.
  â¢   To social organisations, civic movements, and communities already
      working to defend rights in the digital environment.
  â¢   To companies and technology teams aiming to align innovation with
      social impact and ethics.

  Because Digital Citizen Sovereignty is not a luxury, nor a
  technical issue reserved for specialists. It is a necessary
  condition for digital transformation to be truly fair, inclusive,
  and democratic.
