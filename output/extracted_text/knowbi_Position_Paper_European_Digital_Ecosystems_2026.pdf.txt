1. Introduction
Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the European Commissionâs initiative on
Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems.

As a European SME at the forefront of data engineering, know.bi is deeply committed to
advancing open-source innovation and supporting the EUâs vision for technological
sovereignty, competitiveness, and cybersecurity.

Our work with Apache Hop as co-founders and core developers, and our enterprise-ready
distribution, Putki, directly addresses many of the challenges and opportunities outlined in
your call for evidence.

2. What is Apache Hop?
Apache Hop is a modern, open-source data integration and orchestration platform
designed to empower organizations with flexible, scalable, and transparent data workflows.
Apache Hop allows organizations to ingest, transform, and manage data flows across
diverse environments (On-premise, Cloud, and Hybrid).

As active contributors and maintainers, we have seen firsthand how Apache Hop enables:

   ââ Vendor neutrality and reduced dependency: Organizations can replace
      proprietary ETL tools with a community-backed, open alternative, aligning with the
      EUâs goal of reducing external dependencies.
   ââ Transparency and Security: Open-source development fosters trust, allowing users
      to audit, modify, and secure their data pipelines.
   ââ Community Growth: We are actively expanding the Apache Hop community, with a
      focus on sustainability, documentation, and ease of adoptionâkey factors for
      long-term success.
   ââ A "Neutral Harbor" (The ASF Model): Apache Hop is hosted by the Apache
      Software Foundation (ASF). This governance model (The "Apache Way") ensures
      collaborative meritocracy. While the ASF is legally based in the US, its neutral,
      non-profit status protects the code from corporate monopolization or sudden
      licensing "bait-and-switch" tactics, effectively creating a global "Digital Commons."â
      Note: While we anticipate a high-level response from the Apache Software
      Foundation regarding global governance and foundation-level policy, this submission
      by know.bi is intended to provide the Commission with specific evidence of how
      these projects operate "on the ground" within the European ecosystem and the
      specific industrial challenges we face.
   ââ Multicloud and Sovereign Cloud Readiness: Apache Hop is inherently
      cloud-agnostic. It is designed to run seamlessly on-premise and on European Cloud
      providers, ensuring that EU organizations are never "locked-in" to a specific cloud
      infrastructure and can maintain total control over their data residency.

3. A European-Led Commercial Ecosystem
It is important to realize that "where the code is hosted" is less important than "where the
expertise resides."

   ââ Founded in Europe: the Apache Hop project was founded by three European
      (Belgian) project members, who are still very actively involved in the project.
   ââ 90% European Core: Despite the projectâs global reach, 90% of the top 10
      contributors and the majority of the Project Management Committee (PMC) are
      based within the European Union (specifically Belgium, France, Italy, and Germany).
   ââ Significant European User Base: Apache Hop has a large and growing adoption
      rate across European sectors including finance, manufacturing, healthcare and
      government. This adoption is reflected in the project's digital footprint: approximately
      25% of all website traffic originates from EU Member States, representing the
      projectâs most significant regional block of active users. This is further evidenced by
      high levels of engagement from European developers and users on the projectâs
      GitHub repository. This widespread adoption proves that European open source
      technology is a viable alternative to non-EU proprietary software stacks.
   ââ Economic Engine: The strategic direction and development of this critical
      technology is driven by European SMEs like know.bi, which invest significant R&D
      resources into the project to solve real-world industrial challenges. Through our work
      with customers and on our own initiative, know.bi has contributed numerous bug
      fixes, features, and plugins back to the Apache Hop project, ensuring continuous
      improvement and innovation for the entire community.

4. Enterprise Distributions (Putki)
While Apache Hop provides a robust foundation, many organizations require additional
support, security, and scalability to adopt open-source solutions at scale. Putki is our
enterprise-ready distribution of Apache Hop, designed to address these needs:

   ââ Security Lifecycle Management: Putki is designed to provide Continuous Security
      Maintenance, backporting critical fixes to older versions and proactive mitigation of
      CVEs. This ensures production environments remain protected without requiring
      constant, high-risk platform upgrades.
   ââ Professionalization & Stability: Through Long-Term Support (LTS) releases and
      curated distributions, Putki aims to reduce the "attack surface" and installation size
      (potentially by half), directly increasing the resilience of EU digital infrastructure.
   ââ Predictability: We provide enterprise-grade testing for critical connectors (Odoo,
      Salesforce, SAP), ensuring that updates do not break operational business systems.
   ââ Regulatory Alignment Roadmap: Our vision for Putki includes a roadmap
      specifically tailored to EU requirements, such as generating Software Bill of Materials
      (SBOM) for transparency and developing features for centralized audit logging and
      PII masking to facilitate GDPR compliance.

5. Specific Policy Recommendations
We propose the following actions for the European Open Source Sovereignty Fund:

   1.â Support Business-Led R&D: Provide grants to European SMEs that drive the R&D
       and professionalization of critical open-source technologies.
   2.â Funding for Regulatory Readiness: Provide financial support for European SMEs
       to meet the requirements of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), including the creation of
       SBOMs and professional security audits.
   3.â Modernize Public Procurement: Public tenders should specifically value "European
       Enterprise Distributions" that provide the SLAs and long-term security maintenance
       required for public infrastructure.
           a.â Reduce Administrative Barriers: The current complexity of EU-level
                government tenders favors large multinational corporations with dedicated
                legal and procurement departments. We recommend the introduction of
                Simplified Tendering Procedures or Technical Assistance Grants
                specifically for Open Source SMEs. This would ensure that smaller,
                innovative European firms have a fair chance to compete against global
                giants without being disqualified by the sheer administrative burden.
   4.â Governance Recognition: Recognize projects as "European" based on the
       geographic location of the core maintainer base and user community, regardless of
       the legal seat of the hosting foundation.
   5.â Testing Infrastructure: Support integration testing for European tools with global
       business systems (e.g., Odoo, SAP). Ideally, the EU should provide or fund testing
       environments on European cloud infrastructure to ensure that our technology
       remains globally competitive while remaining fully integrated with the European
       digital ecosystem.

6. Conclusion
Digital sovereignty is achieved when European enterprises can choose a supported, secure,
and locally-maintained alternative to global proprietary monopolies. By supporting the
developers behind Apache Hop and the SMEs building enterprise solutions like Putki, the
EU ensures its digital future is transparent, secure, and European-owned.

We invite the European Commission to engage with know.bi and the Apache Hop
community to explore how these recommendations can be implemented. Together, we can
build a more sovereign, secure, and competitive digital future for Europe.
