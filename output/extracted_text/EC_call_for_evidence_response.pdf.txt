Ref. Ares(2026)1225268 - 03/02/2026

The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, an Austria-based non-profit organisation
working in the public interest, oversees the development and maintenance of free software
in the R environment for statistical computing and graphics (https://www.R-project.org).
The R Project provides a programming language and platform for all types of data analyses.
Thousands of contributors from all over the world collaborate in this project.

Initially founded as an academic project 30 years ago, R became the lingua franca for
statistical computing and is broadly used in data-driven enterprises, such as the
pharmaceutical industry, governmental and non-governmental organisations, as well as in
R&D in general.

Since mid-2025, the R Foundation receives financial support from the German
Sovereign Tech Fund (https://www.sovereign.tech/de/tech/r-project).

The following response was prepared in consultation with members of the R Foundation
(https://www.r-project.org/foundation/members.html). We also made an informal call for
input via our social media channels and incorporated information from several R users that
responded, notably Wolfgang Huber (European Molecular Biology Laboratory and co-
founder of the Bioconductor project) and members of the R Validation Hub
(https://app.pharmar.org/).

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are the main
barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source;
and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

Strengths:

The EU is a major player in the global open-source sector, hosting many open-source
software projects and contributors. The R project is one example of this: a third of the core
development team are in the EU, the non-profit R Foundation that supports the project is
seated in Austria, and R is one of the few projects with a package repository hosted in the
EU (also Austria, https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/28/the-dependency-layer-in-digital-
sovereignty.html).

The EU open-source sector has been at the forefront of the "Public money, public code"
movement - even if not formal supporters of the campaign by the Free Software Foundation
Europe (https://publiccode.eu/en/), this philosophy is prominent in EU institutions,
encouraging use of Open Source Software (OSS), and support for the development and
release of code/software under an open-source license.

The use and development of OSS has been a catalyst for academic collaboration and
knowledge exchange between academia, industry and the third sector. Within the R
community we see this, for example, through the R Foundation facilitated *useR!*
conference, which attracts several hundred attendees across sectors and has been held 11
times in the EU.
The broader EU open-source community is diverse and active, as evidenced by conferences
such as FOSDEM, held for over 25 years in Belgium and this year attracting >8,000
participants. Such events help us to learn from other OSS projects and keep informed about
relevant issues.

EU member states have also been active in the Research Software Engineering movement,
for example, the first non-UK RSE association was launched in Germany, with several other
EU associations following (https://society-rse.org/international-rse-organisations/). While
research software is not necessarily open-source, this is often the case, and the R project
and wider R ecosystem (including community-developed add-on packages) have been a
beneficiary of funding coming as a result of this movement.

Weaknesses:

Many open-source projects with a substantial footing in the EU - either via their
development and governance or via their userbase - are critically underfunded and facing a
sustainability crisis. The R project has been fortunate to secure funding and investment in
the short term (1-2 years), but faces significant uncertainty in the medium to long term.

Main barriers that hamper the adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open-
source:

R users within companies or institutions can face barriers due to internal IT policies. For
example, the R Foundation often receives requests to fill in a Third-Party Risk Management
Form, Voluntary Product Accessibility Template or other vendor assessment. Since we are
not a vendor and do not have the resources to handle such requests, we refuse them, but
this may prevent some users from adopting R.

Main barriers that hamper maintenance of high-quality and secure open-source:

Many EU business and public institutions (including academic institutions) are "free-riders"
in their use of open-source software. Since R is not sold as a commercial product and the R
Foundation does not provide any form of support contract, we don't have a direct
mechanism for users to fund the maintenance of R. A small number of organisations donate
money or infrastructure to the R Foundation and a small number of businesses are
members of the R Consortium, a USA-based 501(c) that supports R and the wider R
ecosystem. However, many institutions are not able to make donations, and we have no
interest in providing a commercial product or support contract. There have been some
efforts to provide trickle-down automated funding for dependencies, e.g. thanks.dev
(https://thanks.dev/), ecosyste.ms (http://ecosyste.ms/), stackaid.us
(https://www.stackaid.us/), DRIPS (https://www.drips.network/) - however, currently, R
cannot benefit from any of these as it does not fit into the framework of how dependencies
are identified. Some funding schemes require the OSS to be hosted on GitHub, which we do
not use directly. Some depend on measures of criticality which misrepresent R (e.g. the
OpenSSF Criticality Score https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score, which used a GitHub
mirror that does not fully represent the activity of the project), or miss R (e.g. FOSSEPS
https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/fosseps/open-source-work-2021-
funded-isa2), which recorded RStudio 366 times, but R only twice despite R being an
essential dependency of that third-party IDE). Some research funders are prepared to fund
development or maintenance due to the criticality of the software in their country, but
require a project lead based at an academic institution in their country to receive the funds,
which is not always possible.

What are the main barriers that hamper sustainable contributions to open-source
communities?

The development and maintenance of R is largely a voluntary endeavour. This includes
unpaid, personal time as well as community/professional service within paid employment,
e.g. as part of an academic's research time. The questions of "why?" and "how?" people
contribute to the base system have been studied by Fox (2009, DOI:10.32614/RJ-2009-014).
There are many motivations for voluntary activities (to satisfy a sense of obligation, to do
intrinsically rewarding work, to contribute to the broader public good), but Fox identified
the "how?" as the key issue. Contributors are invariably users first. Factors explaining the
adoption of R include the package system (simple extensibility), communication (via version
control, email lists, and personal meetings), platform independence, and its free nature. The
latter especially helped bring R into the university education quickly. While users may be
motivated to contribute, sustainable maintenance and development require the ability to
commit long-term. As the freedom and security of academic positions diminish, and the
maintenance of base R becomes less about statistical innovation and more about
robustness, efficiency, security, keeping up-to-date with changes in dependencies and
operating systems, etc., core development as an academic side-project is not a sustainable
model.

In addition, it takes time and effort to establish an on-ramp to contribution, to ensure a
sustainable flow of people moving from ad-hoc to more sustained contributor. A lack of
documentation, novice-friendly tools, training and mentoring can all hamper sustainable
contribution.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please provide
concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation,
among others) that are most important to assess the added value.

R, being free software, gives its users the freedom to explore how computations are
performed in every necessary detail. Access to this information is crucial for faster
innovation (standing on the shoulders of giants and being able to learn from the best),
quality assurance (ensuring correctness of results), and long-term reproducibility (assessing
analyses done a long time ago). The large pool of add-on packages for specialised
analyses (currently > 23'000 packages hosted on https://CRAN.R-project.org) with
standardised installation procedures across all major platforms allows users to deliver high-
quality data products and implement even very complex analyses quickly and reliably.

R is used by several public agencies, where open-source is particularly valued for improving
transparency and enabling digital sovereignty. Some examples: European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control, Istituto Nazionale di Statistica, Statistics Portugal, Statistics
Denmark, Institut national d'Ã©tudes dÃ©mographiques, Institut national de la statistique et
des Ã©tudes Ã©conomiques, EUROCONTROL (the European Organisation for the Safety of Air
Navigation), European Marine Observation and Data Network.

OSS provides the ability for data providers or data users to develop customised software to
extract, analyse and report on this data, where no commercial software exists or where
commercial software is inaccessible due to cost. This can apply, for example, to public data
or data generated by a scientific instrument. In the R world, several such tools are collated
by rOpenSci: https://ropensci.org/.

OSS is an essential pillar of open science. For example, in biological science, progress is
driven by what can be measured: innovations in instrumentation require progress in
analytical methods, which are disseminated via both research papers and scientific
software. Having a developed, open-source culture enables biologists to move faster, be
more productive and more innovative than fields with a closed-source culture, which tends
to lead to dead ends and silos. OSS avoids vendor lock-in and reduces the costs of
conducting research. The Bioconductor project (https://www.bioconductor.org/) is a
collection of peer-reviewed, interoperable, open-source R packages for bioinformatics,
which is a great example of OSS underpinning open science.

OSS also enables the prevalent distributed funding and management model of science,
where scientists in many institutes, countries, and companies work together in a âscientific
fieldâ (in contrast to research in legal and economic monoliths such as large corporations).

Over the past ~5 years, the pharmaceutical industry has been replacing the proprietary
programming language SAS with R, particularly in clinical reporting to the European Medical
Agency (EMA). This move has prompted a groundswell of open-source collaboration across
the industry that was non-existent when using SAS. Today, the pharmaceutical industry is
converging and collaborating on shared open-source packages that deliver the core
regulatory reporting needs, including standardised clinical data processing
(https://github.com/pharmaverse/sdtm.oak), standardised clinical analysis
(https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/) and collaborating on software validation
(https://github.com/pharmaR). In addition to the immediate cost savings by eliminating
software licenses, there are significant savings due to the synergistic effects of the industry
moving to open-source as a whole: the adoption of open-source tools has resulted in
reduced costs associated with redundant in-house software development, reduced costs of
onboarding new analysts and developers to custom in-house tools and improved security by
making industry tools more transparent and auditable. In addition, it has led to innovation
in analytic methods due to OSS providing the freedom to modify and build on the software.

Furthermore, health authorities benefit from pharmaceutical companies adopting open
science practices. They are better able to reproduce analyses using shared, open-source
tools and are better suited to troubleshoot any discovered inconsistencies. Where
previously health authorities needed to learn each organisationâs proprietary tooling, the
use of open-source software has prompted a standardisation of tooling, reducing the
amount of organisation-specific knowledge needed to review an analysis.
3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

Free software development crucially relies on a secure infrastructure for project
communication, software deployment, unit testing, and hosting of dedicated
services. Together with several universities and other organisations, the R Foundation
provides and maintains its own IT infrastructure for such services instead of relying on
services offered by commercial enterprises. Offering reliable, secure, and stable hosting and
communication services, as well as access to computing environments for software testing
and building, would help contributors to the R Project to concentrate more on software
development and maintenance.

As a beneficiary of investment from the Sovereign Tech Agency, we welcome the call for an
EU Sovereign Tech Fund (https://eu-stf.openforumeurope.org/) that can secure and
maintain critical open-source software. It is important that there are long-term sources of
funding for open-source projects and that all states benefiting from open-source contribute
to such funding.

Any EU funding schemes for OSS must have a light-weight application process, recognising
that developers, software foundation personnel and other project contributors are often
volunteering their time, and have limited capacity for project scoping and grant writing. We
note that many open-source projects, like R, are global endeavours and as such we
encourage broad inclusion of countries where beneficiaries and partners may be located.
Non-EU countries that contribute significantly to the R project include (in alphabetical
order): Australia, India, Switzerland, the UK, the USA, and New Zealand.

We would like to see the development of mechanisms by which users of OSS, in both the
public and private sectors, contribute to open-source. We note that some projects view the
Cyber Resilience Act as a potential opportunity for sustainable funding of OSS, e.g. through
third-party voluntary security attestations (https://github.com/orcwg/cra-
attestations/blob/main/proposals/gen-two-tier-approach.md). This is unlikely to benefit R:
the CRA only applies to commercial products built on OSS: R is not a commercial product
itself (the R Foundation is not a "manufacturer") and only a handful of businesses directly
build commercial products on top of R, so there is minimal scope to offer support contracts
to manufacturers as an "Open Source Steward". There might be scope to monetise support
for "consumers": organisations that use R to analyse data and create data products, but this
would require massive investment on our side, and we have no expertise in this area. A
potential approach may be for an organisation to offer such services to OSS projects - act as
an intermediary between OSS projects and consumers (users), with the money raised
shared between the umbrella organisation at the OSS project.

As a software project rooted in academia, we welcome innovative approaches to academic
institutions supporting OSS. There are many directions this could take:
â¢   Creation of national or European Research Software Institutes, where OSS
    developers and other project members (e.g. community managers, developer
    advocates, package repository managers, ...) might hold regular or honorary
    positions, potentially globally remote. This would provide job security for OSS
    contributors, provide a way to access research or other types of funding and
    could also provide a way to share legal, financial and technical infrastructure
    across OSS projects. Short-term roles (developer-in-residence type positions)
    might be used for mentoring advanced contributors. The FutuRSI initiative is
    working towards a national research software institution in Germany
    https://www.futursi.de/.
â¢   Creation of Open Source Program Offices within universities. This could again
    provide a base for contributors to large-scale national/international projects, as
    well as support for local academics using and developing OSS as part of their
    research and/or teaching. The OSPO at Trinity College Dublin is one EU example
    (https://projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/en/research-
    area/industrial-research-and-innovation/eu-valorisation-policy/knowledge-
    valorisation-platform/repository/university-open-source-programme-office).
â¢   Funding for research software engineering support for maintenance of existing
    research software. The UK Medical Research Council recently piloted parallel
    awards to support the maintenance of research software nominated by
    successful grant applicants (https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/better-methods-
    better-research/). Such awards directly acknowledge the criticality of software
    and aim to distribute funding with minimal bureaucracy. It would be good to see
    similar parallel awards incorporated in EU grant funding.
â¢   Funding or research software engineering support for development of existing
    research software. It is often possible to get funding for the development of new
    research software (e.g. an add-on R package), but there are no resources building
    on existing work. This is a disincentive to collaboration and the development of
    high-quality, reliable OSS.
â¢   Funding for scientific software development academic positions, similar to the
    Simons Foundation Scientific Software Research Faculty Award in the USA
    (https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/scientific-software-research-faculty-
    award/). This would raise the profile of work related to research software within
    academia.
â¢   Promoting good practices across academia for recognising OSS as a research
    output. This might include:
        o Funding for open access journals covering research software (e.g. the R
            Journal, which is published by the R Foundation and the Journal of
            Statistical Software, which publishes OSS and corresponding reproducible
            scholarly articles)
        o Clearer policies/incentives encouraging academic credit for research
            software outputs. Research evaluation and promotion procedures should
            include research software as a performance metric. Developing
            guidelines, like those written at Monash University Business School
            (attached), could help other institutions implement workable policies.
        o Clearer policies/incentives encouraging academic institutions to treat
            research software as a scholarly work, like a research article or teaching
                  material, for which academics own the IP. Many universities have policies
                  that assign the IP to the university, largely because they view software as
                  a potential money-making opportunity and not a public good.

Sustainable OSS projects do not only rely on the development of code but also on writing
technical documentation, systems administration, financial administration, community
engagement, event organisation, translation, accessibility and security assessment, among
other tasks. It is important that funding and other support are available to OSS projects to
fulfil these tasks.

The EU should provide platforms to make models/guidelines, e.g., for regulatory purposes,
easily available. For example, the European Food Safety Authority has the R4EU platform
(https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/science/tools-and-resources).

If any studies are commissioned to research OSS within the EU, or to define measurements
of criticality, it is essential that OSS projects impacted by the research are consulted. We
request that we be informed of such studies to ensure that R is not unfairly excluded or
misrepresented.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

When policy-makers are considering information or digital technology on a grand scale, it is
tempting to focus on broadly-used technologies, e.g. supporting the open internet or open
desktop. This can overlook more specialised technologies and applications that nevertheless
play a critical role in the public and private sectors, such as R.

In general, creating a culture and environment in which free software projects can flourish
and contributors can put their time to good use, seems more beneficial than a top-down list
of projects, areas, or tasks to be prioritised.

That said, technology that is or would be of wide benefit to OSS projects should be a strong
candidate for support. An example is ForgeFed (https://forgefed.org/), which aims to
federate across software forges, providing the networking and collaboration benefits of a
centralised platform, while allowing OSS projects to host their own forges and maintain
digital sovereignty.

In addition, the EU should support OSS projects to meet high accessibility standards and
support localisation efforts so that everyone can benefit from the four freedoms of OSS (the
freedom to run the software; the freedom to study and change it; the freedom to
redistribute; and the freedom to distribute modified versions).

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open-source lead to increased competitiveness
and cyber resilience?

The primary, secondary, and tertiary education systems should exclusively use and provide
free software for learning, training, and research. Allowing the next generation to take
ownership and responsibility for the free software environment is the least expensive and
most efficient way to increase competence, competitiveness, and resilience. Projects
helping schools and universities to achieve this goal are candidates for prioritisation.
 Monash Research Software Standards
 8 October 2025

The Faculty treats high quality open source software as a research output and awards points accordingly.
This is consistent with international trends to recognize and support research software development (Anzt
et al., 2020; Barba et al., 2019; Doerr et al., 2019; Druskat, 2019; SFDORA, 2012).

Evaluation committee
A peer evaluation committee will consist of a rotating group of discipline experts from within and external to
the Monash Business School. The Panel Chair will be delegated by the Deputy Dean Research. The committee
will obtain at least one review from an anonymous and external reviewer, or at least two reviews if the
submission includes no previous peer review.
In its evaluation, the committee will consider the following issues:
  â¢ Where a software output implements a method proposed in a paper by the same author, the software
    should be assessed as to what it contributes beyond the methodology in the paper.
  â¢ Software that is maintained and developed over many years and many versions may be granted addi
    tional points over time. There must be at least three years between submissions relating to the same
    software project.
  â¢ The comments of the external reviewer(s).
The committee may award 0â3 points for each submission, taking account of comparable quality standards
for journal articles.
If a committee member has a conflict of interest (e.g., s/he has co authored the software submission), the
remaining committee members will consider the relevant submission.
The committee will provide brief reasons for its decision.

Submissions
Submissions to the committee should include the following:
  â¢ Evidence of previous peer review if any, such as acceptance on CRAN or via ROpenSci.
  â¢ The full source code in a version controlled repository such as GitHub.
  â¢ The scope of the developerâs contribution. For pre existing software, include information about the state
    of the project before the contribution, and the state afterward, include links to the relevant code diff/
    pull request(s).
  â¢ Evidence of user facing and/or developer facing documentation.
  â¢ For pre existing software, provide evidence of: (a) new features (e.g., a new method to do something the
    software could not do before); (b) improvement of general features (e.g., improved memory management
    or linear algebra code used throughout the project); and/or (c) ongoing maintenance (e.g., upgrading
    documentation, responding to users on discussion forums, dealing with bug fixes, updates to conform
    to changes in software infrastructure and standards, etc.).
  â¢ Testimonials from feature users (for added features) OR developers (for low level improvements).

                                                      1

Guidelines
Method documentation If the software implements a previously published method/model/algorithm,
please provide citations to the relevant literature. If the software implements previously unpublished
methods, they need to be described in the software documentation to the same level that would be required
for a journal publication.
Generalisability The Australian Research Data Commons Ltd (2022) provides a 3 level classification of
research software.
  1. âAnalysis codeâ is typically the code associated with a research paper that allows the results to be
     reproduced.
  2. âPrototype toolsâ provide a general implementation of a method/model/algorithm that can be used for
     a wide range of applications.
  3. âResearch software infrastructureâ provides a general platform that allows others to build prototype
     tools.
In general, analysis code is unlikely to be awarded research points. We expect that research software submis
sions that are awarded points are likely to be either prototype tools or contributions to research software
infrastructure.
Code documentation s a minimum, we would expect each user facing function to be fully documented with
arguments explained, and examples provided. Even better would be an additional vignette describing the full
workflow for an analysis using the software. Having the code documentation available online is desirable;
this can be done using providers such as GitHub pages, readthedocs or Mintlify.
User impact We are looking for evidence that the software is useful to other researchers, not just to the
authors and their collaborators. Such evidence may be in the form of user testimonials, download statistics,
and forks/stars on GitHub, for example.
Releases and versioning t is important that the software is version controlled, and that users of the software
can cite a specific version, released on a specific date. One way to do this is to use the GitHub release system.
See Making software citable for some further suggestions.
Bug reports and contributions Provide a mechanism for handling bug reports or software contributions.
If using GitHub, this can be done via GitHub issues and GitHub pull requests respectively. Other version
control platforms have similar facilities.
Long-term development Are there plans to continue to develop the software with additional features, or
just to provide bug fixes?
Governance How is the software managed? Who are the maintainers? For larger projects, the âMinimum
Viable Governanceâ tool from GitHub may be appropriate.
