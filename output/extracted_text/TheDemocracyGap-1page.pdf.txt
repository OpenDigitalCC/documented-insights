THE DEMOCRACY GAP
Ireland's Missing Innovation Pathway
An opportunity for the EU Presidency 2026

The Gap
Ireland has no pathway for citizen (incl. postgraduate) innovation.
Ireland funds a 26-year national litter monitoring system that does not publish geospatial data,
photographic evidence, its methodology, or enable citizen participation.
Ireland is home to a leading global open source UN-recognised platform that has received
500k geotagged observations across 100+ countries and 98+ peer-reviewed citations â incl. Nature
& The World Bank â yet Ireland has no postgraduate pathway or pilot mechanism to evaluate
or advance the research.
Comparable platforms: NZ $2.7M Â· US $1.5M Â· GER â¬2M Â· Ireland â¬0

The Window
Q1-Q2 Decision Window: A decision now will determine what Ireland can deliver.
Q2-Q3 LitterWeek Pilots: Schools, community groups & LA take the LitterWeek intervention.
Q3-Q4 Evaluation & Results: Present results at the Cork Mayors Summit on Climate & Health in
December. Cork is home to OpenLitterMap & LitterWeekâthe constituency of the Taoiseach and
the EU Commissioner for Democracy.

The Ask
   1.â Name a Department lead for citizen science
   2.â Commission LitterWeek pilots via ETBs and Local Authorities.
   3.â Feature Irelandâs citizen science as a Presidency outcome

The Stakes
Ireland will hold the EU Presidency having signed every relevant international agreementâAarhus,
SDGs, Copenhagen Framework on Citizen Dataâwhile supporting none of the digital infrastructure
those agreements require.
The OECD's April 2025 report on citizen science explicitly recommends national strategies and
dedicated funding mechanisms. Ireland will be assessed against these benchmarks by EU partners
throughout 2026 and beyond.
