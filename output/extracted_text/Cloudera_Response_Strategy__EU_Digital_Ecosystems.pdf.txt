(OSPO)

SUBJECT: Evidence regarding Initiative Ares(2026) 69111 â "Towards European Open
Digital Ecosystems"

Executive Summary
Cloudera provides the data infrastructure for 12 of the top 20 European financial
institutions and critical public sector bodies. Our evidence suggests that while the EU
has successfully promoted Open Source Software (OSS), a new form of vendor lock-in
has emerged that threatens digital sovereignty: Data Format Lock-in.

True digital sovereignty requires a dual approach: enforcing Open Data Standards to
prevent lock-in, and mandating True Hybrid architectures to ensure true resilience.
Without these, European entities risk migrating from proprietary software to proprietary
clouds, where they effectively "rent" access to their own data. This undermines the
portability goals of the Data Act and creates systemic concentration risk.

Evidence & Recommendations
Response to Question 2: What is the added value of open source for the public and
private sectors?
The Value is Sovereignty: "Owning vs. Renting" Data
The primary value of products and solutions based on OSS should be Interoperability.
Proprietary cloud providers often utilize OSS (e.g., Linux or Kubernetes) but store the
resulting user data in proprietary, opaque formats. This creates "Data Gravity" that
makes migrating off their platforms technically difficult and financially punitive (due to
egress fees).

                                                                                                1

   ââ Evidence/Example: Consider a European Bank modernizing its data
      warehouse.
         ââ Scenario A (Proprietary Cloud): The bank uses a hyperscalerâs
            proprietary analytics tool. The data is ingested and converted into a closed
            format. If the bank wishes to move that data to a European sovereign
            cloud or on-premise due to regulatory changes, they must pay to export
            and "refactor" petabytes of data. The bank is renting its data.
         ââ Scenario B (Open Standards): The bank utilizes Apache Iceberg (an
            open table format) and Apache Ozone (open storage). The data remains
            in a universally readable, vendor-neutral format. The bank can switch
            compute engines or cloud providers without moving or rewriting the
            underlying data. The bank owns its data.

Clouderaâs Role as Steward:

Through our "Responsible Stewardship" model, often in collaboration with the Apache
Software Foundation, Cloudera helps to ensure these standards remain
vendor-neutral, deterring any single entity (including ourselves) from capturing the
ecosystem.

Response to Question 3: What concrete measures may be taken at EU level?
To achieve true technological sovereignty, the Commission must expand its scope
beyond the focus on OSS to include Data Architecture.

Measure 1: Mandate "Open Data Formats" in Public Procurement
The EU should update procurement guidelines to require that any software purchased
by the public sector must store and output data in Open, Standardized Formats (e.g.,
Apache Parquet, Apache Iceberg, Avro) by default.
   ââ Impact: This eliminates the risk of "Vendor Lock-in" at the data layer. If a vendor
      disappears or changes terms, the public sector retains immediate, programmatic
      access to its historical data without proprietary tools.

Measure 2: Recognize "Hybrid Cloud" as a Sovereignty Requirement
The strategy should explicitly define "Sovereignty" as the ability to operate across
environments. A "Cloud-Only" policy creates a dependency on external connectivity and
non-EU providers.

                                                                                        2
                                                       â                        OSPO â
                                                            Open Source Program Office

   ââ Recommendation: Incentivize architectures that support "True Hybrid"
      deployments where the same OSS stack can run on a US Hyperscaler, a
      European Sovereign Cloud, or an on-premise air-gapped data center. This
      ensures resilience against geopolitical shocks.

Conclusion
Cloudera warns that focusing solely on OSS allows vendors to market their products as
open, while locking customers in at the data layer, essentially applying a practice
sometimes called âopenwashingâ. We urge the Commission to prioritize Open Data
Standards and Hybrid Interoperability as prerequisites for a competitive, sovereign
European digital ecosystem.

Offer of Technical Assistance:

Given the complexity of modern data architectures (Lakehouses), Cloudera is available
to host a technical workshop for Unit E.3 to demonstrate the practical differences
between proprietary and open storage formats in banking and telecommunications
environments.
