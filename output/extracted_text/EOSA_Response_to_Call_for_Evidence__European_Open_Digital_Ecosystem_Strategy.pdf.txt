INTRODUCTION
The European Open Source Academy (EOSA) welcomes the European Commission's
initiative to develop a strategic approach towards open digital ecosystems, particularly
as it relates to recognition of and support for open source software (OSS) and open
source hardware (OSH). As an institution dedicated to advancing understanding of the
importance and impact of open source technologies across Europe, we offer our
perspective across four critical dimensions: Excellence and Achievement, Business and
Impact, Advocacy and Awareness, and Skills and Education.
                                                                                        3

EXCELLENCE AND ACHIEVEMENT
Europe hosts world-class open source projects and communities whose technical
excellence deserves systematic recognition and support from policymakers and the
broader public alike. However, the current ecosystem lacks consistent mechanisms to
celebrate and incentivise excellence in open source collaboration and development.

Barriers to Recognition
ââ Insufficient visibility of European open source projects compared to corporate-backed
   alternatives.

Open source contributions remain foundational to economic value creation in European
and global industry, but are not commensurately visible and well-understood amongst
policymakers and the general public. This is particularly evident in digital and public
procurement policy, and must change if we are to actually expand digital sovereignty by
building on open foundations. (Source: European Open Source Academy)

ââ Lack of standardised metrics for evaluating open source excellence beyond download
   statistics.

Traditional metrics like GitHub stars and download counts provide limited insights into
project quality and impact. While stars might indicate passive appreciation, they don't
necessarily correlate with actual usage or technical excellence. A more comprehensive
evaluation requires consideration of multiple dimensions. Work on this is being done by
the OSAwards.eu project team. (Source: OSAwards.eu)

Recommended EU-Level Measures

1. Continue supporting European Open Source Awards with public support to elevate
      successful projects and maintainers from across the continent.

The European Open Source Awards must remain a forefront part of the Commissionâs
strategy for outreach to the open source ecosystem. Elevating the importance of open
source technologies creates a forum where contributors, supporters, and advocates can
improve recognition of their own work and celebrate that of others, as well as a forum for
exchanging ideas and networking between policymakers, industry, and the open source
ecosystem.

2. Create evaluation frameworks that recognize diverse forms of excellence: technical
       innovation, community building, documentation, and accessibility.

Beyond traditional metrics, Europe needs comprehensive frameworks at the
Commission-level that assess: community health indicators including contributor
diversity and retention rates; documentation quality and accessibility for new
contributors; security practices and vulnerability response times; and integration with
European digital infrastructure. These metrics should also be worked into procurement
policy, and support reform of the Public Procurement Directive to favour and strengthen
the improvement of open source technologies.

BUSINESS AND IMPACT
While open source underpins 70-90+% of digital economy code, European businesses
and public sector organisations face significant barriers to effective engagement, limiting
both adoption and contribution. There needs to be an increased awareness of the
business and impact of open source, helping to better strengthen public and industrial
policy to leverage the benefits of open and collaborative innovation.

Barriers
ââ Misconceptions about open-source business viability.

Despite compelling evidence of viable open source business models, persistent
misconceptions continue to hinder adoption. The belief that open source is incompatible
with commercial success ignores successful examples, requiring more success stories of
European success stories, as well as documentation of best practices. (Source: EOSA

ââ Limited evidence-based resources demonstrating successful business models and
   economic impacts.

Each Euro invested in OSS could multiply its impact across the European economy, but
there's a question of where to invest. Recent data shows that while Europe accounts for a
substantial share of global open source developers, its contribution to open
source-derived infrastructure remains fragmented across countries. More granular data
is needed on this to support European investment. (Source: Harvard Business School)

ââ Insufficient diffusion of open source contributions across European Member States.

Germany and France together represent more than 40% of total European output,
considering the open source projects created. By contrast, a long tail of Member States
each contributes only a few percent, indicating that open source capacity is unevenly
distributed. This must change if Europe is to harness the potential of (Source:
OSAwards.eu)

ââ Public sector procurement processes are often inadequately structured for open
   source solutions.

In software-driven sectors, procurement practice remains largely disconnected from
these goals. Digital systems are still treated as generic goods or services, rather than as
long-term strategic infrastructure. As a result, procurement decisions should be updated
                                                                                        6

to reflect their long-term impact on control, competition, and value creation. (Source:
OpenForum Europeâs input on the Public Procurement Directive)

Recommended Actions
1. Develop public sector open source procurement guidelines that recognise the total cost
       of ownership and strategic value beyond licensing fees.

Existing rules and guidance must be adapted to the realities of software lifecycles, where
continuous maintenance, security updates, and ecosystem dependencies are central.
Doing otherwise would limit the ability of procurement policy to support the Union's
strategic digital priorities in a meaningful and systematic way. The Open Source Business
Allianceâs procurement guidelines are a good reference for guidelines.

2. Create a European open-source business model database showcasing viable approaches
       and success stories.

A comprehensive repository documenting proven business models would address
knowledge gaps inhibiting adoption. The database should feature European success
stories alongside international examples, with particular focus on SME-applicable
models.

3. Facilitate matchmaking between businesses, public sector organizations, and
      open-source communities to strengthen mutual engagement.

Creating structured forums and platforms for interaction between public sector entities,
businesses, and open source communities would improve understanding of mutual
needs and capabilities. Such initiatives could include: regular networking events,
mentorship programs, and procurement education initiatives. This can build on the work
the Commission is already doing through EC-OSPO.

4. Require public funding recipients to contribute back to open source dependencies
      proportionate to their usage and derived value.

Organisations receiving EU funding must maintain SBOMs documenting open source
dependencies and actively contribute back through: direct financial support to critical
dependencies; dedicated developer time for maintenance and security; infrastructure
support; or governance participation. The contribution scale should reflect the value
extracted. Public funding provides leverage to correct the consumption-contribution
imbalance where organisations extract significant value while contributing minimally to
sustainability.

5. Require and facilitate contributions from profitable organisations towards the open
      source dependencies core to their business.

Many organisations have open source software and hardware as key dependencies for
their business. While it is one of open sourceâs superpowers to enable innovation where
there is no funding â and to support small, loss-making companies so they can grow and
bring their own positive impact to society â it is fair to expect those who are profitable to
give back to their dependencies. The contributions could be financial, but as not every
open source project can easily scale, it could also take the form of fully subsidised
employee (developer or other) time.

ADVOCACY AND AWARENESS
Despite open source's ubiquity, critical projects and communities often remain invisible
to policymakers, industry leaders, and the public. This gap is at the core of the European
Open Source Awards and the work of the European Open Source Academy. Closing this
gap is critical, as failing to do so risks undermining sustainable support for the open
source ecosystem and perpetuates misunderstanding, under-resourcing, and
under-utilisation of technologies and capabilities from open source communities.

Barriers
ââ Organisations rely on critical open source projects without awareness of their fragility
   and precarity.

Organisations rely on critical open source projects without awareness of their fragility
and precarity, and we must be aware of high-impact projects with critical dependencies
in European institutions and industry, as well as across Europe's software supply chains.
(Source: EU Sovereign Tech Fund report)

ââ Limited understanding       of   open    source    sustainability   challenges   among
   decision-makers.

Around 60% of maintainers remain unpaid for their work. These maintainers
overwhelmingly prefer predictable, recurring income over one-time payments to
manage ongoing responsibilities. Without a systematic understanding of these
sustainability challenges, policymakers and corporate decision-makers cannot address
the structural problems threatening critical infrastructure. (Source: Tidelift)

ââ Insufficient funding mechanisms for projects serving public infrastructure functions.

The XZ utils attack in 2024 demonstrated the fragility of underfunded critical
infrastructure. Projects with paid maintainers implement 55% more critical security and
maintenance practices than unpaid maintainers and resolve outstanding vulnerabilities
45% faster. (Source: Sonatype)

ââ Open source hardware faces unique challenges with limited visibility compared to
   software.

Unlike software, where marginal distribution costs approach zero, hardware involves
ongoing material costs and manufacturing dependencies. While projects like RISC-V
demonstrate OSH viability in processor architecture, and companies like Arduino and
                                                                                              9

those available for OSS. (Source: Open Source Hardware Association)

Recommended Actions
1. Support European open source infrastructure mapping to identify critical dependencies
       and vulnerabilities.

A comprehensive mapping exercise â either newly commissioned or building off existing
work by organisations like Software Heritage â could identify (amongst other things):
critical projects with few maintainers supporting essential European infrastructure;
dependency chains showing how widely-used software relies on smaller upstream
projects; projects with security vulnerabilities or slow vulnerability response times; and
geographic distribution of maintainers for critical projects. Such mapping would inform
targeted funding priorities and reveal single points of failure in European digital
infrastructure.

2. Create dedicated funding streams for critical open source infrastructure projects serving
       the European public interest.

Europe needs dedicated public funding streams for critical open source infrastructure,
such as the proposal for an EU Sovereign Tech Fund, which could help ensure
sustainable maintenance of projects upon which European digital infrastructure
depends. Dedicated European funding streams should support activities such as (but not
only): full-time maintainer positions for critical infrastructure projects; security audits; new
feature development; reducing maintainer burden; and response capacity for
vulnerabilities.

3. Develop public communication campaigns highlighting open source's role in digital
      sovereignty and innovation.

Public awareness campaigns can build public support for open source investment while
attracting talent to the ecosystem. Such campaigns could explain (for example) how
open source enables European digital autonomy by reducing dependence on
proprietary vendors; the economic value generated by open source contribution and
adoption; the security benefits of transparent, peer-reviewed code; and how open
collaboration drives innovation in critical technologies.

4. Support open source hardware initiatives with recognition of unique challenges
      requiring different support models.

Open source hardware remains underfunded and under-leveraged by the public sector,
requiring public support through exploration of new support mechanisms. Such
mechanisms could (amongst other things) address: capital requirements for prototyping

and manufacturing; supply chain management and component sourcing; quality
assurance in distributed development; and intellectual property considerations for
physical designs. European support could include grants, facilities, supply chain
coordination services, legal guidance, etc.

SKILLS AND EDUCATION
Europe faces a growing skills gap in open source competencies across educational
levels and professional contexts. Without systematic integration of open source into
European-wide skills and education initiatives, Europe risks losing a competitive
advantage in this strategic domain, failing to harness the potential of a deep talent pool.

Barriers
ââ Open source remains peripheral in most educational curricula despite its central role in
   industry and a robust open source workforce

Across all years, the EU countries account for a share of GitHub contributor accounts
comparable to that of the United States (â23%) and substantially higher than that of China
(â12%). That indicates that Europe supplies a large share of the global talent base and
does not lack skills or engagement in OSS, but it is under-leveraged in public and
industrial policy. (Source: OSAwards.eu)

ââ Unclear career pathways into open source contributions and maintainership.

Students often lack understanding of how open source contributions translate to career
opportunities and professional development, and employers struggle to find open
source talent. Unlike traditional employment pathways with clear progression, open
source career development appears opaque. This ambiguity discourages students from
investing time in contributions despite the strong industry demand for open source skills.
(Source: Linux Foundation)

ââ Limited integration of open source practices in academic research despite potential
   benefits.

While open science movements advocate for open data and reproducible research,
practical integration of OSS/OSH development practices in academic research training
remains limited. This gap results in research software and hardware that is difficult to
reproduce, validate, or build upon, undermining scientific progress. (Source: Open
Research Community Accelerator)

Recommended Actions
1. Integrate open-source principles and practices into educational policy frameworks at
       the EU and national levels.
                                                                                      12

Educational policy should recognise open source competencies as core digital skills
alongside traditional programming and IT capabilities. Policy frameworks should
establish learning objectives, competency standards, and assessment methods for open
source skills.

2. Develop open source skills frameworks and competency mapping aligned with industry
       needs and the European Qualifications Framework.

Mapping open source competencies to EQF levels would enable recognition across
European educational systems and support labor mobility. A comprehensive skills
framework could define competencies across: basic open source literacy (e.g.,
understanding licenses, communities, and contribution processes); technical skills (e.g.,
version control, collaborative development, testing, documentation); community
engagement (e.g., communication, mentorship, governance participation); and maintainer
capabilities (e.g., project leadership, security practices, community building).

3. Require open source practices in EU-funded academic research (e.g., Horizon Europe),
       including open data, open methods, and open source tools.

Horizon Europe and other EU research funding programs should mandate the
publication of research software and hardware under OSI-approved open source
licenses, as well as ask for documentation enabling reproducibility and sustainability
plans for widely-adopted research software and hardware. Implementation should
include researcher training and support services.

4. Establish mentorship and pathway programs connecting students to open source
       communities and career opportunities.

Programs like Google Summer of Code demonstrate the value of structured student
engagement around open source skills. Europe needs equivalent initiatives at scale.
Recognition of student contributions through digital credentials or portfolio platforms
could support career development.

CONCLUSION
The European Open Source Academy stands ready to contribute expertise, networks,
and evidence to support the European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy. We emphasise
the critical importance of treating open source as public infrastructure worthy of public
investment, creating clear frameworks for business and public sector engagement,
raising awareness of hidden dependencies, and building systematic educational
pathways. These actions, taken together, will strengthen Europe's digital autonomy while
fostering the sovereignty, security, competitiveness, and innovation essential to future
digital prosperity.
