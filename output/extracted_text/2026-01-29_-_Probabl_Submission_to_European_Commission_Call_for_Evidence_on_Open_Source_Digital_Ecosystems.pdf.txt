Probabl Submission: Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems

1. Executive Summary

Probabl welcomes the opportunity to present evidence to the upcoming European Open
Digital Ecosystem strategy.

Probabl is the software company committed to the stewardship, sustainability, and
industrialization of state-of-the-art open source libraries, commercial solutions, and services
that enable enterprises to own their data science. We are the stewards of scikit-learn, the
reference open source library for machine learning â a global technical standard and
patrimonial asset with over 3.9 billion downloads. We represent a voice that remains rare but
could be more common in Europe if the right support levers are put in place: an open source
project, born from public research funding at Inria, that successfully spun out into a
mission-driven challenger company with the backing of both public and private investment.

At Probabl, we are convinced that open source technologies and open digital ecosystems
present a versatile and powerful lever for the EUâs policy goals by distributing technology
horizontally and universally. We are in full agreement that the potential of open source
innovation cannot be achieved through research grants alone. Our key messages are:

   1.â Recognize that Europe is a global powerhouse built on global collaboration:
       According to GitHub data, the EU ranked 1st in the world in 2025 in terms of code
       contributions to public projects on GitHub (over 155 million), outpacing the USA
       (below 140 million) and India (below 118 million). At the same time, EU-based open
       source projects and organizations benefited immensely from global collaboration,
       receiving millions of code contributions from developers and organizations based in
       the USA, UK, and India, among many other countries. This underlines a crucial fact
       the EU should not overlook when developing its strategy: Open source is global and
       therefore building bridges with global open source ecosystems must be a priority.
   2.â Invest in professional stewards of open source ecosystems that can develop,
       maintain, and sustain industrial-grade, enterprise-ready solutions and
       services: The EU should invest in the creation, scale-up, and sustainability of
       commercial open source software companies that can steward ecosystems and
       bridge the gap between dynamic open source innovation and the challenges of
       building and deploying industrial-grade, enterprise-ready solutions and services.
   3.â Establish EU-wide fund for the maintenance and security of critical open
       source software: We support the call for the creation of a dedicated, mission-driven
       EU Sovereign Tech Fund that would invest in the maintenance and security of critical
       open source software that form the building blocks of our global digital economy,
       building on the success of Germanyâs STA. These components are indeed digital
       infrastructure and therefore it is critical that the maintenance work done by the
       developers (or, often, the developer - singular) is adequately funded.

Our response elaborates avenues for how the EU can effectively support the innovative
firepower of open source ecosystems for the benefit of the EU and the world as a whole.
2. Answers to the Call for Evidence Questions

Q1: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open source sector?

   ââ Strength: Global leader: Europe is a global leader in open source, particularly in the
      scientific Python and data science stack. As GitHubâs response highlights, the EU is
      an open source powerhouse that thrives and benefits from global collaboration:
          ââ In the EU, 24.9 million developers and 1.3 million organizations are active on
               GitHub. They collectively contributed to 54 million EU-based projects.
          ââ EU-based developers made the most contributions to public open source
               projects on GitHub in 2025 (155 million code contributions), ahead of the USA
               (just below 140 million) and India (just below 118 million).
          ââ The EU is second globally in the number of developers on GitHub, following
               the USA (30 million) and ahead of India (24.5 million).
          ââ EU-based open source projects received significant contributions from
               developers across the world, including the USA (over 934,000), UK (over
               553,000), and India (over 347,000), among others.
          ââ To illustrate the global nature of open source ecosystems, on the following
               page, image 1 visualizes the top 20 economies by Git pushes and image 2
               visualizes the geography of pull request creators in the scikit-learn repository.
   ââ Strength: Economic impacts: The dynamism of Europeâs open source ecosystem
      translates into tangible economic impacts. As GitHubâs response highlights:
          ââ A 2021 study for the European Commission found that open source software
               contributed a minimum of â¬65 to 95 billion to EU GDP.
          ââ A 2024 Harvard study estimates the global demand-side and supply-side
               value of open source software at $8.8 trillion and $4.15 billion respectively.
   ââ Challenge: Limited venture capital: European open source projects struggle to
      spin out into companies due to limited venture capital for commercial open source
      companies compared to the USA. An exception to the rule is Paris-based Serena,
      which champions commercial open source companies, as well as the upcoming
      funds Commit by Red River West and Open Capital that are both dedicated to
      funding commercial open source. Such specialized VCs are rare in Europe as their
      LPs have not been acquainted with the less standard business models prevalent in
      open source projects (examples of successful companies in the USA should drive
      European appetite to finance these models: Red Hat, MongoDB, Elastic Search, etc).
   ââ Challenge: Operational vs. scientific maturity: Most European organizations lack
      formal strategies and Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) to support and sustain
      the open source tools and communities they depend on.
   ââ Challenge: Competitive disadvantage in public procurement: Tendering
      processes favor established proprietary vendors through rigid templates and an
      immediate cost focus that ignores the long-term value of open source alternatives for
      the digital resilience of organizations and the hidden costs of vendor lock-in.

Q2: What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors?

   ââ Strategic ownership: Open source offers organizations strategic ownership of parts
      or all of their technology stack, allowing them to maintain control and trust. In the
      context of data science, this enables organizations to own their data science and AI,
      ensuring AI capabilities are core internal assets rather than outsourced services. This
      also protects critical and sensitive data, shielding them from leaks.
   ââ Industrial-grade reliability: Professionalized stewardship provides a professional
      layer of accountability, rigor, and predictability required for industrial-scale
      deployment. Such stewardship bridges the gap between community-driven
      innovation in open source projects and the production needs of enterprises.
   ââ Interoperability and transparency: Open source foundations provide verifiable
      foundations that prevent the limitations of black-box AI systems, which is essential for
      the explainability and fairness of AI solutions and compliance with EU regulation.
   ââ Digital resilience without protectionism: By promoting interoperable standards,
      open source ensures European digital infrastructure is grounded in choice and
      resilience rather than tech cynicism or oligopolistic dependence.
   ââ Talent: Participation in open source is a key lever for attracting, building, and
      retaining high-level talent, as it allows experts to contribute to global, open innovation
      ecosystems. A survey of over 500 open source maintainers by the Sovereign Tech
      Agency shows that open source maintainers are a highly skilled demographic, with
      over 50% having 15 years or more professional experience in software engineering.
Q3: What concrete measures and actions may be taken at the EU level?

   ââ Invest in professional stewardship models: Move beyond R&I grants to fund open
      source companies that provide the development and provision of industry-grade,
      enterprise-ready solutions that grassroots open source projects tend to lack.
   ââ Bridge the venture capital gap: Address the fundraising disparity between the US
      and EU by creating targeted incentives for VC funds to invest in category-defining
      open source leaders. This can be addressed through specialized funds-of-funds
      aiming for âimpact dividendsâ by incentivizing production of open-source products.
   ââ Establish the EU Sovereign Tech Fund: Drawing on Germanyâs success, establish
      a pan-European EU STF as a mission-driven fund that addresses chronic
      underinvestment in the maintenance of critical open source technologies. As the
      GitHub response notes, âA successful open source industrial policy should not
      restrict itself to promoting the commercialization of open source software. While
      commercialization is an attractive and realistic goal for some projects, as shown by
      the large number of successful open source businesses, it is inappropriate for
      othersâ¦ It is important to distinguish between open source products, which are
      easier to monetize, and open source components, which make significant
      contributions to the European economy by forming basic building blocks of EU
      companiesâ technology stacks, without lending themselves to commercialization.â
   ââ Mandatory upstream contribution in procurement: Require that companies
      supplying open source to the public sector demonstrate active upstream
      contributions to ensure the long-term sustainability of the underlying open base
      technologies.
Q4: What technology areas should be prioritized and why?

   ââ The data science and AI stack: AI is more than just the model layer (i.e. open
      models). Prioritize funding for open source tooling used across domains of data
      science and AI, from statistical machine learning with tabular data to language
      modelling, and across the stack, ensuring the entire lifecycle from data to impact is
      supported by transparent, modular, and high-performance open source tools.
   ââ Data-driven priorities for the European ecosystem: According to a 2025 Linux
      Foundation survey of 316 stakeholders in Europeâs open source ecosystem, the most
      important technology areas that should be invested in are operating systems (43%),
      AI and machine learning (38%), and cybersecurity (34%).
Q5: In what sectors could open source lead to increased competitiveness?

   ââ Sector-agnostic tooling: Investments in sector-agnostic open source tools will be
      beneficial. For example, open source tooling for data science and AI offers
      cross-cutting advantages, as they are used across sectors, including healthcare,
      finance, and manufacturing. In addition, in highly regulated sectors like the
      aforementioned, open source offers transparency and audibility that facilitate trust.
