   Feedback on European Open Digital
              Ecosystems

Srdjan Randjelovic
1. Strengths, weaknesses, and barriers to adoption
and sustainability

Strengths

Europe possesses deep engineering talent and a mature
research base that has consistently contributed to
foundational open-source projects. Public institutions
across several Member States have demonstrated that open
technologies can deliver robust, interoperable digital
servicesâparticularly where long-term maintenance and
vendor independence matter most. Open source is already
embedded in 70â90% of modern software stacks, meaning
targeted interventions in sustainability and security yield
disproportionate returns across the entire digital economy.

Weaknesses and barriers

The critical failure point is not project inception but long-
term maintenance. Core libraries and infrastructure
components often rely on precarious funding models and a
handful of overextended maintainers. This fragility
propagates upstream: when foundational elements lack
sustainable governance, everything built atop them inherits
that risk.

Public procurement remains structurally misaligned with
open-source realities. Tenders typically reward one-off
delivery rather than ongoing maintenance, security
patching, or community stewardshipâeffectively
penalising the very activities that ensure longevity.
Meanwhile, open-source-native companies face uneven
access to growth capital; investors still struggle to model
revenue around community-driven development, leaving
promising ventures stranded between seed funding and
scale.

Infrastructure dependencies compound these issues.
Hosting, CI/CD pipelines, artifact storage, and coordinated
vulnerability disclosure are not optional extrasâthey form
the operational backbone of viable ecosystems. Yet they
are routinely underfunded and fragmented across
jurisdictions.

In regulated sectors, the obstacle is rarely license cost. It is
integration complexity, compliance traceability, and the
absence of reference implementations that demonstrate
operational readiness within EU legal frameworks.

2. Added value of open source for public and
private sectors

Open source delivers concrete advantages where lock-in
carries strategic risk. Systems built on transparent
foundations can be independently audited, forked if
necessary, and integrated without proprietary gatekeeping.
This directly affects procurement leverage and exit options
ânot as theory, but as operational reality.
Security improves not because "many eyes" magically find
bugs, but because open toolchains enable supply-chain
visibility, faster patch propagation, and third-party
validation of critical components. Closed stacks obscure
dependencies; open ones expose themâmaking
remediation possible before incidents escalate.

For SMEs, open source lowers the barrier to compete on
service quality, integration expertise, and domain
specialisation rather than reinventing foundational layers.
Public institutions gain lifecycle resilience: budgets shift
from perpetual licensing toward targeted investment in
maintenance, customization, and skillsâaligning
expenditure with actual value delivery rather than vendor
dependency.

3. Concrete EU-level measures

       â¢Treat maintenance as strategic infrastructure. Fund
       multi-year stewardship of critical componentsânot
       just code development, but security hardening,
       documentation, release engineering, and governance
       capacity. The focus must shift from "starting
       projects" to sustaining what already works.
       â¢Reform public procurement templates to explicitly
       accommodate maintenance contracts, security
       update SLAs, and managed services. Enable public
       bodies to purchase sustainability, not just initial
       delivery.
       â¢
       â¢Establish shared "foundation infrastructure":
       neutral hosting, build/release systems, vulnerability
       coordination platforms, and artifact distribution
       networks. These should operate as public digital
       goods, not commercial dependencies.
       â¢Streamline administrative pathways for open-
       source SMEs seeking growth capital. Reduce
       friction in accessing EU innovation funds while
       preserving community governance models that
       resist extraction.
       â¢
       â¢Fund practical adoption enablers: reference
       architectures for legacy integration, migration
       playbooks for regulated sectors, and interoperability
       testing against dominant proprietary stacks.
       Adoption stalls at the integration layerânot the
       license layer.

4. Priority technology areas

Prioritise layers where dependency risk concentrates and
value extraction occurs:
       â¢Cloud and AI infrastructure (orchestration, data
       platforms, MLOps tooling)âthese determine where
       economic value accrues and where external
       dependencies embed most deeply.
       â¢Cybersecurity fundamentals: SBOM generation,
       dependency provenance, vulnerability coordination,
       and reproducible builds. These are baseline
       requirements for trustworthy supply chainsânot
       optional enhancements.
       â¢Open hardware and edge/HPC toolchains where
       feasible. Technological sovereignty spans the full
       stackânot just software.
       â¢

5. Sectors where open source can raise
competitiveness and cyber resilience

       â¢Public administration: where auditability,
       interoperability, and lifecycle cost control directly
       impact service resilience and citizen trust.
       â¢Automotive and advanced manufacturing:
       software-defined systems now drive
       competitiveness; open stacks enable faster iteration,
       supply-chain transparency, and vendor
       diversification.
       â¢Healthcare and finance: sectors where traceability,
       controlled change management, and regulatory
       alignment benefit from verifiable components and
       auditable workflows.
       â¢Critical infrastructure operators: where long-term
       maintainability and supply-chain security are non-
       negotiable strategic requirements.
       â¢
Cross-cutting constraint: energy and grid capacity
Scaling European cloud and AI capacity faces a hard
operational constraint: predictable, affordable energy and
timely grid connections. This is not an energy policy debate
âit is a practical reality for data centres and HPC facilities.
Without addressing this physical bottleneck, even the most
promising open ecosystems struggle to scale inside Europe.
The strategy should acknowledge that digital sovereignty
requires physical infrastructure readiness. Concurrently, it
can promote energy-efficient software practices (profiling,
scheduling, optimisation tooling) and encourage
procurement criteria that reward measurable efficiency and
total lifecycle costânot just licensing terms.
