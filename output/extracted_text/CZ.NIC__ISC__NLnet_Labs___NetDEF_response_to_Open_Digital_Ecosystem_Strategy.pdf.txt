          Joint response to the Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy

We, the undersigned organisations, are responsible for the development and maintenance of some
of the most well-known and widely adopted Open Source Internet Infrastructure Software.

CZ.NIC (www.nic.cz) is an association responsible for running the registry for the top level domain
of the Czech Republic (.CZ). CZ.NIC also develops and maintains a set of open source software in
the area of internet infrastructure like routing daemon BIRD and DNS servers Knot DNS and Knot
Resolver.

Internet Systems Consortium, Inc (www.isc.org) a not-for-profit company (operating under US
IRC section 501(c)3) based in the US), is dedicated to developing software and offering services in
support of the Internet infrastructure. âISC is responsible for developing and distributing three
widely-deployed open source Internet networking software systems: BIND9, ISC DHCP, and Kea
DHCP, and operating one of the 13 root name server systems of the Internet.
â
NLnet Labs (www.nlnetlabs.nl) is a Dutch, independent public benefit organisation founded in 1999.
Its mission is to write open-source software and contribute to open standards for the Domain Name
System and (safe) inter-domain routing, thereby improving the robustness, security and reliability of
the Internet. NLnet Labs maintains widely used implementations for DNS including NSD and
Unbound, and the safety of inter-domain routing including Krill and Routinator.

Network Device Education Foundation (NetDEF - www.netdef.org) is a US 501(c)3 not-for-profit
company registered in California. NetDEF hosts and maintains the public CI/CD infrastructure for
FRR (the Free Range Routing project). NetDEF also ensures compliance, maintains, tests and
develops code for most of the routing protocols in FRR. FRR is used widely as the routing stack on
everything from home routing gateways, enterprise routers and data center infrastructure.

 This submission provides evidence from the perspective of four non-profit organizations
 employing maintainers for long-lived open source projects in the public interest.â
 Two of us are based in Europe, two of us are based in the US. All four employ EU-based
 maintainers.â
 We respond together, reflecting that open source is a global movement, without borders.
1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector?

What are the main barriers that hamper adoption and maintenance of high-quality and
secure open source?
The Internetâs two core pillars (the Domain Name System and IP routing) are technology areas
where open source software is both invisible and dominant. Our software is used by operators of
internet and telecommunication infrastructure, as well as national top level domain registries around
the world.

EU public and private sector undervalue their open source
dependencies
Since open source is freely-available, our primary challenge is funding software maintenance
and quality assurance activities. We attempt to minimize costs by taking advantage of free
services, while also trying to raise revenue, via charitable grants and sale of professional support
services.

There remains a disconnect between the engineers that select the open source software we
develop to operate their critical infrastructure and their organisationâs willingness to fund sustained
development â the easiest mode of behavior for most companies is to be a free rider. In contrast to
physical network equipment, deploying (gratis) open source software is less often backed by a
budget. In particular, we perceive private-sector organisations in the EU to be likely to assume
funding will be taken care of by others.

We suggest concrete measures corresponding to this observation in Section 3.2.

Most open source development and distribution infrastructure
is US-based
Another structural weakness lies in the reliance on US-based technology companies. Every
open source project requires development infrastructure; a shared software development
environment that enables collaboration and a stable platform for version controls; a group/project
communications system, such a chat or email, compute resources for building and testing the
software; hosting resources, for publishing and storing the software and associated files. These
resources cost money.

Most low-cost or free infrastructure for open source development and distribution is
operated by the big US tech giants Microsoft (Github), Amazon and Google. In most cases, there
is no cost-equivalent alternative from an EU organization. Historically, it is difficult to start or grow a
business that can effectively compete with these entrenched low-cost providers, but it is a
weakness to have a sole source in the market for these infrastructure services.

We suggest concrete measures corresponding to this observation in Section 3.3.

                                                    2
Available funding is short-term and feature-focused
Funding for both services, and personnel must be stable, as abrupt changes in funding cause
disruption and loss of momentum. Maintainer turnover can result in significant loss of intellectual
capital for the project, and modifying systems to migrate from one development environment to
another can consume scarce resources without contributing anything productive for the software
users. For this reason, programs which award grants for a year, or for even shorter periods,
are not the best way to support a stable long-term maintenance in the open source
ecosystem. While we would love to see more grant funds, we would like to see more funding
available for maintaining existing open source, not just new projects or new features, and this would
be most useful if the grants cover a multi-year period. Ideally downstream users should be fully
funding maintenance.

When designing new approaches to funding open source, it is important to consider that open
source organizations are development-heavy, and generally have limited resources to
engage in contract negotiation or extended procurement cycles. While it is important to have
accountability whenever public money is expended, the resulting work product is publicly visible in
the case of open source development and maintenance. Therefore, it should be possible to
minimize the process and contractual overhead required, to make funding more accessible to open
source projects. Low-overhead approaches have been pioneered by the likes of NLnet and
Sovereign Tech Agency using cascade funding models.

We suggest concrete measures corresponding to this observation in Section 3.2.

What are the main barriers that hamper sustainable contributions to open-source
communities?

Sustaining maintainers is the bottleneck
It is challenging for casual users to make useful technical contributions to large, complex software
systems. Every contributed patch requires extensive review by the maintainers, and often requires
extension, addition of tests, and documentation. Not infrequently, community-contributed patches
cause problems in other areas of the code, or conflict with features the contributor isnât using. For
these reasons, we have found that our open source projects require a staff of dedicated or nearly
dedicated core maintainers. Even if the user community is willing to contribute some development,
there must be a skilled team of core maintainers, who will need some funding to sustain their work.

AI technology will not replace human maintainers
As of this writing, we have found LLM-based tooling to be more effective at wasting maintainer time
(bogus vulnerability reports, nonsensical code contributions by well-intentioned individuals who do
not understand what these algorithms produce), than at alleviating the bottleneck of core
maintenance. Even if LLM tools for reviewing code improve to the point where they are significantly
useful, open source projects will still need humans to direct the tools, interact with the user
community, and to take responsibility for managing the projects.

                                                 3
Sustainable open source is less about attracting sporadic volunteer contributions and more about
ensuring that the necessary coordination, review, and operational continuity can be maintained over
time.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors?
The Internet relies on open standards and open source implementations of these standards to
function. We contributed to research by ICANNâs Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC)
titled âThe Domain Name System Runs on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)â that elaborates
on this claim for the Domain Name System. The Internetâs routing system similarly runs on open
source software. The BIRD routing daemon is used at internet exchanges all over the world to
provide their route server function. 100s of millions of home routers on the planet use FRR (or
previous incarnations Quagga or Zebra). All known relying party software for Route Origin Validation
(ROV), a routing security technology that is seeing global adoption, is open source.1

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

3.1 Digital Resilience Plan
Recent geopolitical and trade developments have demonstrated that Europeâs dependence on
nonâEU digital infrastructure, including cloud services and software platforms, can quickly translate
into systemic vulnerability. To safeguard the continuity of essential digital operations, the EU should
establish a Digital Resilience Plan â analogous to the resilience planning obligations introduced for
telecommunications under the upcoming Digital Networks Act (DNA).

This plan would define coordinated preparedness and response measures in the event that political
or commercial actions by the United States or other third countries restrict European access to
cloud, hosting, or software services. Any such disruption could severely affect core functions of the
internal market, cybersecurity operations, and public digital services.

The Digital Resilience Plan should:

      -â   Map the EUâs critical dependencies on nonâEuropean digital infrastructure, cloud services,
           and software collaboration platforms.
      -â   Define fallback strategies and operational continuity measures for sudden disruptions
           affecting USâbased digital services
      -â   Support the growth, funding, and readiness of EUâbased openâsource software projects and
           platforms that can serve as interoperable and immediately deployable alternatives under
           stress conditions.
      -â   Ensure that public investment and procurement mechanisms, including those linked to CRA
           and NIS2 implementation, prioritise openâsource components (co-)maintained within EU
           jurisdiction.

                                                    4
   -â   Coordinate crossâsector recovery planning between national cybersecurity authorities, digital
        infrastructure providers, and openâsource communities maintaining core Internet
        technologies.

By formally integrating EUâbased openâsource software and neutral development infrastructure into
the resilience framework, the European Commission would strengthen both technological
sovereignty and supply chain security. The goal is not isolation, but preparedness â ensuring that
Europeâs digital ecosystem remains operational, secure, and sustainable even under geopolitical
stress.

3.2 Use existing hooks in the CRA and its implementation

 We call upon the EC to leverage existing hooks in the CRA and its implementation:
    1.â Expedite developing the voluntary security attestation programme into an instrument
        that can fund sustainable maintenance of open source software
    2.â Establish that âdue diligenceâ under Article 13(5) involves verifying that any integrated
        components are from âfull-fundedâ sustainable projects.
    3.â Execute the Union-wide dependency assessment (in ADCO CRA) to further increase
        visibility into the role of open source as the foundation of our current digital ecosystem

Expedite developing the Voluntary security attestation programme
Open source maintainers, or their project stewards, who invest in the development process and
documentation improvements required to meet CRA requirements should be able to recoup all of
their maintenance costs and some of their development costs. We ask the EC to expedite
developing the voluntary attestation program for the CRA.

Link âdue diligenceâ obligations to project sustainability
In Section 1, we argued that sustaining maintainers is the bottleneck for sustainable contributions to
open source software. We posited that sustainable open source is less about attracting sporadic
volunteer contributions and more about ensuring that the necessary coordination, review, and
operational continuity can be maintained over time.
To sustain organisations like ours, as well as individuals who would prefer to make open source
maintenance their careers, funding is a necessity. The CRA can provide for a new system of
incentives that provides a source of funding if and only if the âdue diligenceâ obligation connects
directly to the aforementioned voluntary security attestations program.â
To do so, we recommend the EC to ensure that there is a tight closed-loop expression of
maintenance costs in the attestations (Article 25) with due diligence requirements (Article 13(5)) â
Responsible parties inside Manufacturers should clearly appreciate that using components from
underfunded open source projects should be expressly called out in the cybersecurity risk
assessment (Article 13(2-4)) and does not represent âindustry best practiceâ. Manufacturers should
be assessed by Market Surveillance Authorities on whether they are using underfunded open
source projects and whether they are engaging in community support or just free-ridership. A
virtuous feedback loop should be expressly considered in developing the program.

                                                  5
Execute the Union-wide dependency assessment
The ADCO CRA should execute on its Art 13(25) ability to perform Union-wide dependency
assessment on open source components. To make this at all possible, the result of the
standardisation efforts at CEN/CENELEC corresponding to EU 2024/2847 (CRA), Annex A, part II,
para 1 should be critically examined to meet the stated objectives in the law text.

Without a firm requirement on Manufacturers to produce SBOMs that include stable and globally
unique identifiers that identify components and their specific versions, data quality will be
problematic. There can be no such census and EU dependency on open source software will be
underreported, remain politically undervalued and its potential as a crucial contributor to the EUâs
technological sovereignty, security and competitiveness underutilized.

While initiatives like Germanyâs Sovereign Tech fund are promising and welcome, and should be
scaled-up to EU-level,2 direct funding of all of the deserving open source projects is probably
infeasible. With sufficient investment, and building upon existing open source census efforts, the
CRA Union-wide dependency assessment should create a source of open data to prioritize
investment by public and private sectors alike.

3.3 Level the playing field for open source development

    We call upon the EC to:
       4.â Set a procurement norm for IT projects involving open source components. Such norms
           should recognize community commitment and project engagement rather than solely
           lowest cost bids.
       5.â Fund EU-based services open source developers need

Procurement norms should support open source development
The EC should set a procurement norm for itself, the EU member states and the private sector to
require a budget line item for all IT projects involving open source components targeted at
sustaining upstream development communities. Such a norm would be in line with ENISA guidance
on the NIS2 implementing act for the digital sector.3
Responding to commercial RFPs and dealing with government contracts are outside the expertise
and beyond the capabilities of many open source project teams.
Systems integrators and consultants providing these services who contract to provide these
services under publicly-funded contracts should be required to ensure that the actual maintainers
are fully-funded and sustainable for the duration of the tender. If necessary prioritizing some portion
of their revenues to fund the actual maintainers of that open source. This would better enable
governments to adopt and successfully use open source at scale, while also providing some support
to maintainers.

Publications Office of the European Union, 2025): âConsider supporting the communities developing and
maintaining FOSS and invest in a mutually beneficial relationship with them. Where effective, this could
involve relationships with the relevant OSS steward that âprovid[es] support on a sustained basis for the
development and ensures the viability of those products.ââ

                                                      6
Fund EU-based services open source developers need
Funding development infrastructure and services for open source can also stimulate the
development of EU-based cloud services. Currently, open source developers rely heavily on free
services from Microsoft (GitHub software version control, CI/CD and publishing), Amazon/AWS (free
or reduced-cost computing, publication), and Google (email, storage and document collaboration).
Providing European alternatives to these dominant providers will make the open source community
more resilient, while developing the European tech sector.â
â
To give a concrete example, the strategy could stimulate growth of the multiple small, alternative
community-led development platforms that already exist for open source development services.4 It
would strengthen digital resilience if the EU encouraged the growth of multiple smaller, interoperable
hosting and collaboration platforms operated under European jurisdiction. Targeted funding or
procurement preference could stimulate the ecosystem, ensuring that open source communities are
not structurally reliant on a few commercial providers outside the EU.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
The technology areas of focus should be derived from a competent technical risk analysis, (e.g via
the Digital Resilience Plan described in Section 3.1) and focus on areas where service description
would lead to widespread infrastructure and/or security failures.

Proposed priority areas:
   -â Networking applications, such as DNS, BGP, DHCP, and associated systems
   -â Open source networking stacks, and the Linux kernel itself.
   -â Maintenance of the most widely-used cryptography libraries, and on-going development of
      post-quantum cryptography libraries.
   -â Systems used for centralized administrative user authorization and access controls for
      network devices and critical applications.
   -â Open collaboration on Internet protocol development, including collaboration on
      development of solutions to newly-discovered security challenges to existing protocols. (This
      work cannot be simply delegated to the biggest, most well-funded technology companies,
      there should be funding for smaller open source organizations to participate as well.)

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
competitiveness and cyber resilience?
