     European Sovereignty Begins with Language
     Open-Core and the 28th Regime: How Venture Capital Rebrands Control

     1. Digital Sovereignty and Open-Source Infrastructure
     European sovereignty is eroded through the loss of control over the digital infrastructure on which
     Europe depends. Open-source software is central to that infrastructure: publicly funded, widely
     shared, and foundational to everything from cybersecurity to cloud computing. Europe is now
     investing enormous resources into strengthening European open-source ecosystems precisely
     because they are strategic digital commons. But open-source strengthens sovereignty only if it
     remains genuinely open over the long term - not merely in name, but in governance, forkability, and
     institutional independence.

     Digital sovereignty means that Europeâs core institutions - courts, ministries, healthcare systems,
     identity infrastructure - can function without dependence on foreign platform providers who can
     impose unilateral conditions. When the digital backbone of society is controlled outside Europe,
     sovereignty becomes contingent rather than real.

     This is no longer only a software question. The same logic now applies directly to arti cial
     intelligence: the debate over âAI sovereigntyâ is again about whether foundational models,
     infrastructure, and companies will remain under European control, or whether Europe will become
     structurally dependent on US-controlled platforms and capital pipelines.

     In this context, the struggle is almost never presented as an open attack on European sovereignty. It
     is waged indirectly, through language. US-based venture capital actors shape the conceptual terrain
     by coining terms that sound neutral - or even benevolent - while quietly rede ning what is
     considered normal, desirable, or inevitable. In doing so, they shift expectations and institutional
     outcomes in ways that consolidate control.

     When Europeans adopt Silicon Valleyâs vocabulary uncritically, they can end up supporting
     arrangements that undermine Europeâs long-term autonomy without fully recognizing what is being
     ceded. The rst step is seeing clearly. This essay examines two such linguistic maneuvers: âopen-
     coreâ and âWe want a Regulationâ.

     2. âOpen-Coreâ: The Rebranding of Proprietary Capture
     âOpen-coreâ is not a neutral descriptive term. It is a term coined and promoted by US-based venture
     capital actors as a replacement for the older language of freemium - a word that is no longer
     fashionable, and that more clearly signaled what was happening.

     The purpose of this rebranding is straightforward: to âopen-source washâ a business strategy that
     gradually moves open-source projects in the direction of proprietary software, ultimately shifting
     control over European-created - and often European-funded - digital infrastructure into the hands of
     venture-backed US-aligned intermediaries.

                                                                                fi
          This is not merely a licensing debate. It is one of the main ways European-funded open-source
          challengers are prevented from becoming durable competitors to Microsoft, Google, or Amazon.
          Once weakened or enclosed, the European open-source projects become easy to acquire,
          marginalize, or dismantle - thus reinforcing US platform dominance.

          The traditional open-source business model is simple: give away the software, sell the services.
          Revenue comes through hosting, support contracts, consultancy, or SaaS deployment. The code
          remains open, the ecosystem remains forkable, and the community retains real leverage.

          Open-core, by contrast, combines the open-source service model with freemium enclosure
          strategies. Newly developed functionality begins to move behind an âenterpriseâ paywall, while
          normal usage is quietly rede ned as âenterprise usage.â In practice, this restriction often starts with
          seemingly minor limitations: Single Sign-On, administrative tooling, or caps on the number of users
          or seats a system can support. Over time, more and more essential functionality becomes closed.

          Crucially, this process is rarely abrupt. It happens slowly - typically only after a European open-
          source project has accepted venture funding, after adoption has grown, and after switching costs
          have accumulated. The standard defense offered by venture capital is familiar: âIf open-core were
          truly harmful, users would fork the project, and the community would leave.â But this ignores how
          enclosure actually works. Forking is not costless, and these changes do not occur dramatically. They
          occur gradually.

          Open-source projects compromised by VC incentives âboil the frogâ:

                â¢   the proprietary portion grows year by year,

                â¢   enterprise licensing becomes steadily more expensive,

                â¢   and the forkable codebase becomes increasingly incomplete.

          At rst, the paywall seems minor and the license cost seems manageable. Many users do not think it
          is a big deal. But over time, the balance shifts: the licensing costs become expensive and the closed-
          source code creates vendor lock-in.

          Eventually, users and developers face a trap:

                â¢   the open branch is no longer suf cient,

                â¢   the original fully open-source version is outdated and risky,

                â¢   migration is painful,

                â¢   and data export tools are frequently broken - maybe by design.

          By the time the pain becomes undeniable, years have passed. Enough open-source code has been
          removed, rewritten, and placed under proprietary license that what remains in the âopenâ branch is
          no longer suf cient to fork into a viable alternative. Disgruntled developers are no longer forking a
          project - they are being forced into an almost total rewrite. And because so many European-funded
          open-source projects are eventually pulled into venture capital pipelines, it feels nearly impossible
          to nd permanently open-source alternatives.

          A second argument supporting âopen-coreâ is offered by US venture capitalists and their European
          ecosystem allies: âIt is not in our interest to close an open-source license on a project. There would
          be an uproar -the community would fork the project and weâd be left with nothing.â

                                  fi
     But this argument is a distraction. Venture capital does not need to close the existing open-source
     codebase in order to subvert the project. The real control point is the licensing of new code. The
     strategy is not sudden closure. It is gradual enclosure. Venture actors understand perfectly well that
     boiling the frog works, while abrupt relicensing does not.

     These narratives persist because they provide European tech founders with a feeling of safety and
     alignment as they step into VC deals. And founders who have already accepted venture capital often
     continue repeating them, because adopting the US-created framing reduces cognitive dissonance
     about decisions that cannot easily be undone.

     This is why steward ownership matters. Steward ownership is a governance structure in which
     voting rights are structurally separated from pro t rights, so that control remains with long-term
     stewards rather than exit-driven investors. In many steward-owned models, golden shares also
     provide veto rights over key governance operations, such as mergers and acquisitions, dividend
     extraction, or changes to mission and purpose in company statutes.

     Only by placing durable asset locks on corporate governance can open-source infrastructure - often
     publicly funded in Europe, and foundational to European digital sovereignty - be prevented from
     being gradually captured and enclosed by venture-backed incentives. Steward ownership is not a
     niche idealist preference. It is a sovereignty mechanism. And this is precisely why US-based
     venture capital actors so desperately want to prevent it from becoming a European norm.

     3. Narrative Capture of European Company Law
     A similar linguistic maneuver is now unfolding in European startup and scale-up policy. The
     European Commission is currently developing a new cross-border legal form for European startups
     and scale-ups: the so-called 28th Regime. Its purpose is straightforward: to make it easier for
     European companies to scale within Europe, rather than reincorporating in Delaware. This initiative
     was requested by Ursula von der Leyen and motivated in part by the Mario Draghi report, which
     called for greater resilience and competitiveness of the EU economy.

     The European Parliamentâs draft of the 28th Regime, written by Dutch Rapporteur RenÃ© Repasi,
     importantly included both:

       â¢    steward ownership

       â¢    and employee ownership

     as governance mechanisms intended to strengthen Europeâs long-term economic autonomy.

     Enter a broader set of US-backed and US-aligned venture capital actors - including European VC
      rms whose funds are often signi cantly dependent on American Limited Partner capital - together
     with ecosystem partners who are actively shaping how the 28th Regime is framed, discussed, and
     ultimately written.

     It is important to be clear: not everyone involved is acting in bad faith. Many founders, investors,
     and policymakers sincerely believe that Europe needs the strongest and fastest possible instrument,
     and they view certain legal and governance choices as necessary to avoid fragmentation. The
     rhetoric is often genuinely motivated.

                                          fi
One of the clearest examples is the current push for DG JUST to rewrite the 28th Regime as a
Regulation rather than a Harmonizing Directive.

On paper, this sounds attractive. The rhetoric is seductive:

  â¢    âWe donât want a second-best solution.â

  â¢    âA directive will be too slow.â

  â¢    âEurope needs a speedboat regulation, not a bureaucratic compromise.â

These arguments are not frivolous. They re ect real frustration with Europeâs slow scaling
environment, and a sincere desire to make Europe more competitive.

But the political reality is the opposite. The 28th Regime will likely never survive the legislative
process as a Regulation. Despite the signi cant majority in the European Parliament supporting
Repasiâs draft, conservative parties across Europe are deeply suspicious of anything that centralizes
corporate law in Brussels. A Regulation would take control away from the 27 member states, violate
subsidiarity, and provoke precisely the backlash that would cause the entire initiative to be
politically shot down.

This is where structural incentives matter. Even when some advocates are acting out of conviction,
other actors embedded in transatlantic venture pipelines have incentives that are not fully aligned
with a sovereignty-preserving outcome. Anything that makes Europe a more attractive place for
startups and scale-ups to remain incorporated - rather than relocating to Delaware - runs directly
against US venture capitalâs structural incentives.

Venture capitalists also do not want governance innovations such as steward ownership or employee
ownership to become easier. They want European companies to remain acquirable, absorbable, and
ultimately IP extractable - so that European-funded innovation can be folded into US-controlled
corporations and capital structures.

This is why aligned ecosystem partners are pushing to strip steward ownership and employee
ownership provisions out of the 28th Regime altogether. The rhetorical framing is familiar:

  â¢    âWe donât want extra bells and whistles.â

  â¢    âWe need to simplify and streamline.â

  â¢    âGovernance constraints will slow implementation.â

  â¢    âLetâs focus on what founders really need.â

But these are not neutral technical preferences. Steward ownership and employee ownership are not
decorative additions. They are precisely the structural mechanisms that would prevent the 28th
Regime from becoming yet another pipeline for venture-backed extraction.

Once again, the struggle begins in language: whoever de nes the frame controls the outcome.

4. Sovereignty Requires Structural Clarity

                                              fi
     These two dynamics are not separate. Open-core is a micro-level mechanism: it weakens Europeâs
     ability to sustain independent digital infrastructure by gradually enclosing the very open-source
     projects that could have become European competitors. The Regulation vs. Harmonizing Directive
     discussion is a macro-level mechanism: it attempts to shape the legal and institutional environment
     so that European rms remain structurally dependent on the same venture-driven pipeline. In both
     cases, the outcome is the same: Europe loses the capacity to govern its own digital foundations, and
     the eld is cleared for continued dominance by US Big Tech.

     The consequences of this dependence are no longer theoretical. Microsoft reportedly restricted
     access to Of ce365 services for of cials connected to the International Criminal Court during
     investigations related to Gaza - demonstrating how quickly legal and diplomatic institutions can
     become vulnerable when their core infrastructure runs through US platforms. In the Netherlands,
     the acquisition of Solvinity, a rm involved in managing critical digital government infrastructure
     such as DigiD, illustrates how easily strategic European digital capacity can be absorbed into larger
     corporate ecosystems. Even the infrastructure of open software collaboration itself is no longer
     neutral: GitHub, the worldâs largest open-source code platform, was acquired by Microsoft, placing
     the coordination layer of the digital commons inside a US corporate ecosystem.

     These are not edge cases. They are clear and current warnings: European sovereignty is not
     compatible with structural dependence on foreign-controlled digital chokepoints.

     What emerges is a broader pattern:

          â¢        language is blurred,

          â¢        extraction is rebranded as innovation,

          â¢        and Europeans are invited to participate in their own loss of control.

     Whether through âopen-coreâ or âWe want a Regulationâ structural power hides behind benign
     vocabulary. Europeâs autonomy is weakened not through open confrontation, but through rhetoric
     that makes enclosure sound like openness, and capture sound like progress.

     The lesson is simple. European sovereignty - digital, economic, and institutional - cannot rest on
     branding, good intentions, or abstract commitments to âinnovation.â It requires durable structures:
     open-source infrastructure that remains genuinely open over time, and ownership models such as
     steward ownership that align control with long-term stewardship rather than short-term extraction.

     These linguistic maneuvers persist because they work. The task now is not merely to critique them,
     but to see through them, name them clearly, and build European institutions that cannot be governed
     from elsewhere. The rst step is clarity. The next is sovereignty.

     Europe must be able to say plainly: we want open source, not open-core. And we want Steward
     Ownership in the 28th Regime. The question is not whether Europe will innovate. The question is
     whether European innovation will remain European - or whether it will continue to be enclosed,
     acquired, and subordinated inside US-controlled capital and cloud empires.
