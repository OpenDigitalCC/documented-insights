1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU
open-source sector? What are the main barriers that
hamper (i) adoption and maintenance and (ii) sustainable
contributions?
Strengths:

Europe possesses a world-class developer base and a culture of transparency that aligns with
EU digital rights. Initiatives like the NLNet, NeoNephos, Sovereign Tech Fund, and the ECâs
OSPO have laid a vital foundation. SUSE, as a global leader born in Europe, demonstrates that
open source can both serve the community while also meeting the needs of mission-critical
enterprise software required by the Fortune 500.

Weaknesses:
While code is often written in the EU, the secure software supply chain (hosting, CI/CD, and
build-infrastructure) remains heavily dependent on US-based systems. This creates a
"sovereignty glass ceiling" where European development remains vulnerable to external policy
shifts. Also, there is a Value Gap: 70â90% of modern code is open source, but the commercial
value is frequently captured by non-EU proprietary hyperscalers. Critical projects often rely on
under-resourced maintainers.

Barriers:
High-quality adoption is hampered by a lack of objective risk measurement. Decision-makers
face a "black box" problem where they cannot quantify their sovereignty gap. Also, developers
and foundations struggle with country-specific legal frameworks and tax hurdles. Technical
contributions are global, but for digitally sovereign infrastructure, project technical expertise,
governance and maintenance must be preferably anchored in the EU. Another barrier is the
lack of a single hiring regime in the EU. Contracting or hiring in many different countries in the
EU entails much more effort on legal and tax than would be the case in the US. This also
means that funding for Open Source foundations or maintainers is very complex as there are a
lot of practical hurdles (taxes, .. ) when it crosses countries within the EU. An EU wide
Sovereign Tech Fund (EU-STF) could help with bridging this gap.

A major impediment to adoption is prioritizing initial acquisition costs in both public and
private sector procurement. This neglects critical long-term factors - such as maintenance,
security updates, support, and transition expenses - ultimately disadvantaging solutions that
could offer a more sustainable and predictable total cost of ownership.
2. What is the added value of open source for the public
and private sectors? (Include concrete examples: cost, risk,
lock-in, security, innovation).
Strategic Value: Sovereignty through Choice

Open source is a pre-requisite for freedom in terms of interoperability and interchangeability.
Such licensed software provides the Four Freedoms of open source (inspect, use, modify,
redistribute) which are the bedrock of any sustainable and transparent software methodology.

Concrete Examples & Factors:
   ââ Trust: Unlike proprietary opaque black boxes, open source allows for independent
      auditing. With proprietary solutions, you HAVE to trust them. With open source
      solutions, you CAN trust them. The transparency in how data is being processed in
      software solutions leads to a more trust-worthy computing environment for handling
      sensitive data.
   ââ Workload Portability: True sovereignty means the ability to shift workloads between
      on-prem, edge, and sovereign clouds of different types. Open standards ensure that a
      workload isn't "trapped" by proprietary APIs.
   ââ Innovation vs. Consumption: Open source encourages the EU to grow technical skills
      and buy European, keeping R&D investment within the Union rather than exporting it
      as license fees.
   ââ Cost & Continuity: Unlike proprietary software, where support is tied to a single
      vendorâs roadmap, the accessibility of open source code enables a competitive
      ecosystem of providers to deliver long-term maintenance and security patches well
      beyond standard industry timelines.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU
level to support the sector and contribute to technological
sovereignty and cybersecurity?
   ââ Lead by example via Public Money Public Code. EU institutions should mandate
      open-source solutions stemming from the EU's own sector. This creates a snowball
      effect for wider adoption and helps shift the general public awareness towards the
      benefits of open source software over competing proprietary alternatives.
   ââ Establish a EU wide Sovereign Tech Fund to protect maintainers from the growing
      funding gap.
   ââ Establish a clear strategy to sustain open source maintainers and projects in the EU,
      for example by incentivizing via tax-reduction EU business to maintain open source for
        the public good and simplifying the ability to contract open source developers across
        the EU.
   ââ   Standardize Sovereignty Measurement by adopting the EU Cloud Sovereignty
        Frameworkâs Sovereignty Effective Assurance Levels (SEAL 0â4). This allows
        organizations to move beyond "ticking boxes" and use a common language (e.g., "This
        project requires SEAL-3 Digital Resilience").
   ââ   Strictly apply the Common Assessment Method for Standards and Specifications
        (CAMSS) to ensure interoperability is a prerequisite for all public procurement.
   ââ   Any new regulation should not unintentionally increase reluctance to invest in open
        source developments. This should be addressed by creating clear legal "safe-harbor"
        statements for EU-based contributors to lower the administrative burden of or
        uncertainty around regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) on individuals and
        SMEs.
   ââ   Incentivize Reciprocity: Provide R&D incentives for businesses that harden open
        source and contribute significantly back to upstream projects.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
Any cross-sectoral technology should be focused on digital sovereignty from the ground up -
especially if they build core platforms, as such platforms tend to create a vendor lock-in if not
entirely open source and open standards. Key types are:
    ââ Linux Operating Systems: The operating system is the fundament of all sovereignty.
        We must ensure the expertise to develop and support Linux open source operating
        systems as well as its governance in the EU to avoid being passengers in our own IT
        strategy.
    ââ Cloud-Native & Virtualization: As organizations migrate legacy workloads, we must
        prioritize open virtualization and container orchestration to ensure the connective
        tissue of the cloud remains vendor-neutral.
    ââ Sovereign AI (Private AI): Focus on open-source AI frameworks with local models. AI
        must be Private-by-Design to ensure sensitive data stays behind European firewalls,
        preventing "data leaks" to foreign LLM providers.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source
lead to increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
   ââ Public Sector & Administration: Critical for reaching the enhanced level of sovereignty
      demanded in a more geopolitically uncertain world, with reduced risk of interference
      from the impact of extraterritorial regulation like the US CLOUD Act.
   ââ Critical Infrastructure (e.g. Energy & Utilities): These sectors require the right to repair
      software and extreme longevity. Open source ensures that grid management systems
      are not subject to foreign vendor lifecycles.
ââ Telco & IoT/Industry 4.0: In remote or air-gapped locations, sovereignty is a physical
   concept. Open source enables self-sufficient islands of compute that stay online even
   during global service disruptions.
ââ Healthcare & Research: Enables the sharing of high-value data within trusted,
   localized, and scalable infrastructure, fostering innovation while maintaining strict
   GDPR and Data Act compliance.
ââ Defense: The independent access to code is key to reducing vulnerability and ensures
   long-term operation and maintainability. The ability to inspect for backdoors and to
   analyze how and where data is processed or submitted.
