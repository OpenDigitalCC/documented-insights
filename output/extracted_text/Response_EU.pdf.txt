To whom it may concern,

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to voice our opinions on the importance of opensource in
Europe and the role it has to play in digital sovereignty. I will address your questions one by one.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector?
The major problem open-source has in general is funding. Although 90% of all code is opensource,
it gets next to nothing in funds. It is in fact a hobby and passion for most developers. It is thankless
and time-intensive despite the value it provides to the entire world. The second is a direct effect of
the lack of funding: its lack of organisation and representation which leads to little to no common
awareness of the benefits of opensource and just how pervasive opensource is.
A strength of EU open-source comes only from the economical prowess the EU zone provides:
developers are affluent or at least have the most basic needs taken care of which allows them to sink
massive amounts of time in their hobby of software development after work or in university (where
large amounts of opensource is written).

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sector?

**Security**
Opensource has the advantage that it can be reviewed by the public. In fact it can be reviewed by
way more people than closed source code ever can be reviewed. Making it accessible to reviewers
also makes it executable by them so then can test their hypotheses in a working environment. They
can develop opensource tools to find bugs and other vulnerability in other opensource tools.
_Examples_:
- XZ Utils backdoor, though detected surreptitiously, because the code is opensource, the entire
scheme could be uncovered, traced, and ultimately stopped.
- There are countless Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that could be ethically and
resposibly disclosed because they affect opensource software. Closed Source software is often
protected by arcane and convoluted laws which make analysis legally dangerous, thus hindering the
discovery of CVEs

**Effort**
Thanks to opensource, the wheel doesnât have to be reinvented by every developer, company, or
organisation. One need go no further than the ability to read what you are seeing on your screen.
There are countless opesource software libraries making the visualisation on our screen possible. In
a world without opensource, every developer would have to either pay for the code required to draw
anything on the screen or have to write it themselves.
_Examples_:
countless, but if pressed, FFMPEG is opensource software that can handle nearly every video and
audio format known to man. It makes streaming video possible for countless companies and
customers around the world.

**Transparency and trust**
Closed source software can have claims about anything. It can claim it doesnât spy on you, doesnât
steal your data, is safe, isnât malicious, makes you tea, or keeps you safe. However, those claims
can only be verified by those who have access to the code, are allowed to tamper with the software,
or know how to analyse the software after delivery.
Opensource can make those claims verifiable as they are out in the open. With opensource, it is
possible to build a chain of trust due to the visibility of code and infrastructure. This can be
invaluable to governments and private persons alike. Especially governments can build chains of
trust with each other, companies, or private individuals to verify the software and code they use or
receive. Closed source software makes that much much more difficult and has to rely more on the
contractual than the technical.
Examples:
- Microsoft. They sell a âsovereign cloudâ but were forced to openly admit to the inability to ensure
that the cloud would actually be sovereign and no data would end up in US hands
- Google. There have been a myriad cases of their data collection practices. Security researchers
have unveiled their false claims of privacy and security time and time again. They for example
claim that toggling the button to stop collecting location information or history actually does fulfill
its function, yet as they own the code and itâs closed source, we have to take their word for it. Given
their track record, can we really?

3. What concrete measure and actions may be taken at EU level?

**Funding**
It is imperative that the EU aggressively fund opensource projects they use, from top to bottom.
Every library, every application, every protocol, everything. It must be possible to write opensource
software and when its used to make money, the project should see revenue. How this is done will
properly will have to be discussed and debated, but the outcome should be an easy procedure for
projects to be reimbursed. A central registry for opensource projects (and the registry should be
opensource too, not Microsoftâs Github) like a business registry, a new opensource license to legally
enshrine the obligation of payment once financial gains are achieved, something like that.

Another point: opensource shouldnât mean âoh, itâs freeâ. The developers of the Matrix protocol
and Element are having a tough time staying afloat **despite** multiple governments using the
protocol to build secure messengers.

**Public Money, Public Code**
Opensource should be the default for software, for contracts, for research, for anything the
government touches. Our money shouldnât be shovelled into IP that we need to pay to access via a
subscription. Money used to fund the development, procurement, installation, maintenance, â¦ of
software must be tied to an obligation to reveal the source code.

**End of Life = Opensource**
Private companies have a lot of closed source products. Unfortunately, when these products reach
their end of life and are no longer supported by the company, they are often abandonned or become
insecure. This can have digital effects like the Stop Killing Games European Citizenâs Initiative
showed (games being lost, sometimes forever), but also physical, real world effects like e-waste.
Many products end up on the trash heap and pose a tangible problem for governments and
communities worldwide.
Therefore, products that reach EOL must be opensourced. The opportunity must be given to entities
to carry the torch and prevent those products from turning into waste. It can open new markets,
provide employment, lower our carbon footprint, and also lead to innovation.

**Ownership of services**
We are scrambling now to become digitally sovereign and owners of our own destiny. That
shouldnât mean jumping from one frying pan of foreign ownership into the frying pan of domestic
ownership without real ownership. Governments must own their services, software, and when
possible also hardwre. The Eurostack is good way forward, but it must not lead to a single
contractor owning all infrastructure.
Where services are concerned, they should all be self-hosted. When users or others access
âsocial.government.euâ it also helps the user identify genuine services that governments provide as
well approved and public identities. President Von Der Leyen having an account
@vonderleyen@social.europa.eu is much easier to verify than @vonderleyen, @leyen, @vdleyen,
or even @eupresident on some platform, regardless of what icon put around the name to confuse
the user into believing the account is genuine.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

**Communications**
We have to move on from email. It is insecure and already has an alternative called Matrix. While a
lot of email solution are opensource, the major providers are closed source. Focusing on Matrix will
elevate security and accessiblity for all users of the system. Additionally, it will allow integration
with chat platforms of governments ensuring secure and safe transfer of documents and other data
between governments and their citizens.
Using one protocol will also improve communication efforts between government agencies
(nationally and internationally).

**Geospatial data analysis and mapping efforts**
The EU is currently mapped out primarily with Google Maps. Governments readily and happily
give Google an incredible amount of public data. However, that is not necessary as OpenStreetMaps
exists. It is a much more detailed map and can be used for many many things. It is invaluable for the
impaired people of our societies as maps of accessibility have been created with it.
A lot of mapping data is further concentrated in foreign hands like Esri who make ArcGIS and often
lock data from government agencies. It is not seldom seen that government agencies in the same
country have to pay Esri to access data uploaded by other government agencies.

**Banking**
Customers are currently nearly exclusively forced to have either a phone with Google services or
use an Apple product. Not only that but the major payment options that exist are all foreign-owned.
It is very difficult to run banking apps on phones that do not fall into these two categories. The EU
must make it possible for consumers to use domestic technology in order make payments.
Developers face major difficulties despite the open banking iniative to write applications and
services that require payment. The systems are restrictive and locked down making entry into
openbanking nigh impossible as an outsider.

**Mobile phones**
Smartphones are dominated by 2 tech giants that are doing their best to lock down everything about
phones. Writing apps can incur significant costs e.g apps for Appleâs ecosystem can only be written
on Appleâs hardware which is pricy and require a yearly subscription. Google and Apple take 30%
of payments made. Forcing them to change will not alter their market domination as many are
dependent on them. Apple is ferociously closed source and Google is quickly going that way as well
with the increasing gap of source releases for the Android operating system (Google Services were
never opensource).
Smartphones can and should be considered critical technology to opensource. It is being made
increasingly difficult to live without one and if they are not forced to be opensource, the digital lives
of EU citizens will continue to be surveilled, monetised, and in danger of exploitation by foreign
forces.

Thank you for the time taken to read this response. I sincerely hope powerful action will be taken to
make the EU competitive and a hub for innovation again. Opensource is a major force towards this
goal and this chance should not be squandered.
