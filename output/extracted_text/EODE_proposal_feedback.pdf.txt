Feedback on the European Open Digital Ecosystems proposal
Reduce compliance barriers to open-source adoption (GDPR and information security)
   ââ Establish an EU certification mechanism for GDPR and information-security compliance. The
      European Commission should develop a certification mechanism that smaller organisations and
      open-source service providers can realistically obtain, for example with a validity period of three to
      five years. The objective is to reduce uncertainty and transaction costs, and to mitigate the structural
      advantage that large vendors enjoy through packaged legal and compliance capacity.

   ââ Publish EU-endorsed compliance guidance and transition checklists. The Commission should provide
      practical, EU-endorsed guidance on how organisations can transition to open-source solutions in a
      compliant manner. This should include concrete checklists and reference controls (i.e., standard
      security and data-protection measures such as access control, patch management, logging, and
      documentation) tailored to different contexts: private citizens, small and medium-sized enterprises,
      universities, and public administrations.

Provide actionable roadmaps and strengthen interoperability to prevent lock-in
   ââ Develop tailored transition roadmaps for public administrations and businesses. The Commission
      should issue practical transition roadmaps that outline sequencing (what to migrate first), anticipated
      risks, training needs, and procurement templates. These roadmaps should also include examples of
      relevant open standards, such as the Open Document Format (ODF) for document exchange.

   ââ Strengthen interoperability requirements across public-sector information systems. The Commission
      should reinforce interoperability requirements, including the use of open standards, documented
      interfaces (often referred to as âopen APIs,â meaning publicly documented ways for software systems
      to exchange data and functionality), and portability obligations for publicly funded software, thereby
      reducing long-term dependency on single vendors.

Invest in the full open-source lifecycle and introduce more agile funding instruments
   ââ Create a dedicated EU open-source investment and support programme. The Commission should
      establish a dedicated funding instrument to support the full open-source lifecycle: research and
      development, piloting, scaling, long-term maintenance, security improvements, and deployment.
      Funding should explicitly support maintenance and security work, which are essential for reliability but
      frequently under-resourced.

   ââ Leverage existing programmes while reducing administrative burdens. While programmes such as
      Digital Europe and Horizon Europe can support this agenda, the Commission should also introduce
      more agile funding tracks (lighter application requirements, faster decisions, and smaller grants) to
      ensure open-source initiatives are not impeded by disproportionate administrative overhead.

   ââ Build on the digital commons EDIC model. The Digital Commons European Digital Infrastructure
      Consortium (EDIC) provides an existing mechanism for pooling resources among Member States to
      develop reusable digital solutions across borders. The Commission should build on this approach to
      fund shared, reusable open-source âdigital commons.â

   ââ Deploy strategic investment via STEP where appropriate. The Strategic Technologies for Europe
      Platform (STEP) could be used to channel investment into open-source technologies that materially
      enhance European competitiveness and security.

Strengthen European digital infrastructure capacity, including cloud and core âdigital public
goodsâ
   ââ Support European cloud and infrastructure initiatives with concrete deployment capacity. The
      Commission should continue supporting European-based cloud initiatives and open-source cloud

                                                       1
       software, such as the GAIA-X project, in order to provide credible alternatives to dominant
       non-European cloud providers.

   ââ Complement policy development with infrastructure implementation. Policy initiatives such as the
      proposed European Cloud and AI Development Act should be complemented by tangible
      infrastructure-building measures.

   ââ Develop an EU-wide sovereign cloud capability for public services. The Commission should pursue a
      practical, interoperable sovereign cloud capability for public services, understood here as a network of
      interoperable data centres across Member States operating under European jurisdiction, standards, and
      governance. Existing consortia and public institutions (including universities and national research
      networks) should be formally involved in requirements definition and governance, to ensure usability
      and uptake.

   ââ Invest in European alternatives for critical digital infrastructure services. The Commission should
      support, through funding and governance, European alternatives to key infrastructure components
      currently provided predominantly by private and often non-European actors, including:

            ââ a Europe-based, publicly funded code hosting and collaboration infrastructure compatible with
               Git standards;

            ââ cloud storage and collaboration components suitable for public institutions;

            ââ open-source cloud-native capabilities, including âserverlessâ execution (i.e., platforms where
               organisations deploy applications without managing underlying servers directly, while still
               retaining control over governance and compliance).

Align procurement rules and public-sector targets with openness and portability
   ââ Introduce âOpen by Defaultâ procurement guidance. Public procurement policies at EU and Member
      State level should be updated to ensure that open-source options are systematically assessed. Where
      proprietary solutions are chosen, contracting authorities should provide clear justification. Procurement
      criteria should also reward portability, open standards compliance, and transparency.

   ââ Support migration towards open-source operating systems and productivity tools in the public sector.
      The Commission should encourage, and where appropriate, require, public administrations to increase
      adoption of open-source operating systems and productivity suites (e.g., Linux-based operating
      systems, LibreOffice, and open collaboration platforms). Such migration reduces licensing costs,
      improves auditability, and reduces dependency on single vendors. As an illustrative Member State
      example, Denmarkâs Ministry of Digital Affairs has initiated a pilot testing of LibreOffice within
      central administration, explicitly linked to goals of digital sovereignty and reduced reliance on foreign
      technology providers.

   ââ Define requirements for openness in critical infrastructure domains. For critical infrastructure sectors
      (e.g., payments, healthcare, defence), the Commission should set stronger expectations regarding open
      standards and, where feasible, open-source foundations, while maintaining space for European
      private-sector actors to compete on implementation, support services, compliance, user experience, and
      value-added capabilities.

Support open European AI and data ecosystems
   ââ Establish an Open European AI initiative. The Commission should support open-source AI
      frameworks, algorithms, and datasets, including the development of European foundational AI models
      under open licences. This should be coupled with the establishment of open data commons, namely
      shared datasets governed for public benefit and privacy protection, so that smaller European actors can
      access the resources needed to innovate. A relevant example is OpenEuroLLM, a collaborative effort to
      develop open-source large language models covering all EU languages.

                                                      2
Strengthen Member State coordination through national strategies and policy networks
   ââ Encourage national open-source strategies aligned with EU priorities. The Commission should promote
      national strategies that set measurable targets for open-source adoption across government, education,
      and industry, aligned with EU-level objectives.

   ââ Create an open-source policy network and support Open Source Programme Offices (OSPOs). The
      Commission should facilitate an EU-level policy network for Member States to share best practices and
      jointly develop reusable solutions. In parallel, Member States should be encouraged to establish
      OSPOs, namely dedicated coordinating functions responsible for inventorying proprietary
      dependencies, guiding procurement, and supporting training and migration.
