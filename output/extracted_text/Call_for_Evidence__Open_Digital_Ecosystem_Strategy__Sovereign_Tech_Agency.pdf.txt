Towards European open digital ecosystems
Response to the Call for Evidence

The Sovereign Tech Agency welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the European
Commissionâs Call for Evidence informing the forthcoming European Open Digital
Ecosystem Strategyand supports the Commissionâs recognition of technological sovereignty
as a core objective of the current mandate, and of open source as a critical contributor to
competitiveness, cybersecurity, and resilience.

This initiative is timely and aligned with the EUâs broader digital and industrial policy
agenda, including forthcoming initiatives in cloud, data, and AI. Open-source software
underpins nearly all modern digital technologies and is deeply embedded across critical
sectors. It reduces external dependencies, improves supply-chain transparency, and
strengthens vulnerability management. However, the maintenance, security, and long-term
stewardship of widely used components remain structurally underprovided, creating
systemic risks that market mechanisms and project-based funding alone do not address.

Drawing on the Sovereign Tech Agencyâs operational experience, this submission treats
critical open-source components as open digital infrastructure, meaning the shared
software foundations such as libraries, standards, and developer tooling on which both the
public and private sectors depend. Securing this infrastructure requires sustained
investment in maintenance, security, and stewardship, delivered through strategic public
procurement and coordinated funding mechanisms rather than ad-hoc adoption incentives
or short-term projects. On this basis, the submission identifies concrete security and
resilience risks and proposes targeted, proportionate EU-level actions, particularly in
stewardship, procurement, and coordination, to deliver durable gains in technological
sovereignty, competitiveness, and innovation across the Single Market.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are the
   main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure
   open source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

    1.1. Strengths of the EU open-source sector

    Europe is home to a large, growing, and relevant open-source developer base.
    The EU hosts one of the largest open-source developer and maintainer communities
    worldwide, contributing to globally critical projects across operating systems,
    cryptography, networking, databases, programming languages, and cloud infrastructure.
    Platform data indicate that Europe hosts a large and growing open-source developer
    base. GitHub reports multi-million developer populations in the UK, Germany, France, and
    other European countries, with sustained year-on-year growth of approximately 19 to 24
    percent, with particularly strong momentum in Southern Europe.1 Longitudinal studies
    further support the conclusion that Europe has steadily increased its share of global
    open-source contributions over time.2 At the same time, open source is near-ubiquitous
    in deployed software: the 2025 Open Source Security and Risk Analysis (OSSRA) found
    that 97 percent of commercial codebases contained open-source components,
    accounting for around 70 percent of total code.

    Foundational role in key technology domains.
    Open-source components form the backbone of critical technology areas including cloud
    computing, containerisation, cybersecurity tooling, data infrastructure, AI frameworks,
    and industrial control systems. Census data from the Linux Foundation show that widely
    used open-source dependencies are concentrated in core ecosystems such as Java,
    Python, .NET, and increasingly Rust, which underpin public services, industrial systems,
    and cybersecurity tooling3. These are domains in which European developers, public
    administrations, and firms are particularly active, reinforcing the EUâs strategic stake in
    the long-term health, security, and governance of global open-source infrastructure. In
    practice, many of these components are effectively non-substitutable and underpin
    innovation and competition across multiple downstream markets. A Commission-
    commissioned study estimated that EU companies invested around â¬1 billion in open-
    source software in 2018, associated with â¬65 to â¬95 billion in economic impact,
    illustrating the high leverage of investment in open digital infrastructure.4

    Growing institutional recognition.
    At EU level there is increasing formal recognition of open source as an enabler of digital
    autonomy (e.g., the Commissionâs âThink Openâ strategy and related interoperability

    initiatives)5. If aligned with procurement and funding mechanisms, this momentum can
    translate into more stable and predictable demand and greater institutional support for
    under-resourced critical open digital infrastructure.

    1.2. Weaknesses of the EU open-source sector

    Chronic underinvestment in maintenance and security.
    Despite near-universal adoption, large-scale commercial code audits reveal a structural
    mismatch between reliance on open source and the resources devoted to its long-term
    maintenance and security. According to OSSRA 2025, over 90 percent of codebases
    contained outdated open-source components, many more than ten versions behind
    current releases or no longer actively maintained. This dependenceâmaintenance gap
    translates directly into risk: 81% of assessed codebases contained high- or critical-risk
    vulnerabilities, often in components where patches were already available.6 This pattern
    reflects a deeper economic asymmetry between the value extracted from open source
    and the resources reinvested in its upkeep. A Harvard Business School study estimates
    that recreating widely used OSS would cost approximately $4.15 billion, while the
    demand-side value to firms is estimated at $8.8 trillion, implying that firms would need
    to spend roughly 3.5Ã more on software in the absence of OSS7. In practice, this gap
    manifests as systemic under-provisioning of maintenance, security hardening, and
    stewardship for components that function as de facto digital infrastructure.

    Fragmented institutional accountability.
    Whilst attention to open source has increased at both EU and Member State levels,
    there is currently no clearly mandated public actor responsible for the long-term health,
    security, and governance of critical open-source dependencies at EU level. This
    fragmentation is particularly problematic in the European context, where digital services
    and supply chains operate at Single Market scale and beyond, but responsibility for
    open-source infrastructure remains largely national, project-based, or informal. As a
    result, the costs of maintaining and securing shared open-source dependencies are
    borne unevenly, while the benefits accrue broadly, creating persistent collective-action
    failures in which no individual Member State or user has sufficient incentive to invest at
    the scale required for systemic resilience.
    Recent instruments such as the European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC), and
    in particular the Digital Commons EDIC, provide an important legal and governance
    framework for coordinating multi-country digital infrastructure projects. However, while
    EDICs can host and operate shared infrastructure, they do not in themselves resolve the

    gap in sustained, EU-level responsibility for the identification, prioritisation, and long-
    term stewardship or maintenance of critical open-source dependencies across sectors.
    Public administrations across Member States are significant users and developers of
    open source software, as documented in OSOR case studies on cross-government
    adoption, yet the EU lacks a unified institutional mechanism to coordinate sustained
    investment, long-term stewardship, and strategic governance of shared dependencies8.

    Regulatory pressure without corresponding support capacity.
    EU regulatory initiatives, most notably the Cyber Resilience Act, increasingly expect
    open-source components to meet standards of security, transparency, documentation,
    and vulnerability management. While these obligations are primarily addressed to
    downstream manufacturers and integrators, compliance in practice partly depends on
    the capacity of upstream open-source projects to implement secure development
    processes, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and timely patching. Foundations and
    fiscal hosts (such as Linux Foundation or Apache Software Foundation) can play an
    important enabling role in supporting projects with governance, legal, and compliance-
    related processes, and the CRAâs recognition of âopen source stewardsâ reflects this
    function.9 However, many widely used projects remain unaffiliated with such entities,
    and even where foundations are involved, they typically lack the mandate and resources
    to absorb the potential costs of regulatory compliance across shared dependencies. As a
    result, regulatory expectations placed on downstream users are not systematically
    matched by upstream investment in the open-source projects on which compliance
    partially depends.

    1.3. Barriers to adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source &
         sustainable contributions to open-source communities

    Existing procurement frameworks favour proprietary models
    Despite progress in some Member States and municipal contexts, public procurement
    frameworks across the EU often prioritise single-vendor accountability, warranties, and
    short-term cost comparisons, while undervaluing upstream maintenance, contribution,
    and ecosystem sustainability. This discourages adoption of open-source solutions
    unless they are re-captured through proprietary service or licensing models.

    Security capacity gaps
    Many critical projects lack funded capacity for vulnerability triage, coordinated
    disclosure, patch development, and rapid response, despite being embedded in sensitive
    systems. High-profile incidents in recent years (Log4J, xz-utils) have illustrated how
    under-resourced maintenance can translate into systemic security risk. Evidence from

     commercial codebase audits suggests that open source is near-ubiquitous in practice
     (96% of audited codebases contained OSS) but often under-resourced in deployment.10

     Misaligned organisational incentives.
     Within both public and private organisations, upstream contributions such as
     maintenance, refactoring, documentation, and security hardening are often treated as
     discretionary or reputational activities rather than as core responsibilities linked to
     dependency management and operational risk. Research and industry surveys
     consistently show that while commercial entities (from large industry players to SMEs)
     rely heavily on open-source components in production, incentives to invest in their long-
     term health are weak and informal, reinforcing free-rider dynamics and underinvestment
     in critical dependencies.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
   provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security,
   innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added value.

     Private sector value
     For the private sector, open source lowers barriers to entry and supports innovation by
     providing shared foundations on which firmsâparticularly SMEsâcan build differentiated
     products and services without rebuilding commodity infrastructure. This accelerates
     development cycles and supports more competitive and diverse markets.
     Open source also reduces supply-chain risk. Improved governance and maintenance of
     widely reused components lowers exposure to cascading failures across value chains,
     benefiting firms regardless of size. Transparency and shared stewardship make it easier
     to assess dependencies, manage vulnerabilities, and comply with emerging regulatory
     requirements, contributing to both competitiveness and cyber resilience.

     Key assessment factors: development time, availability of reusable components,
     dependency depth, transitive risk, governance and maintenance capacity.

     Public sector value
     For public administrations, open source increases transparency, interoperability, and
     long-term control over core digital systems. OECD research on public-sector digital
     innovation shows that open-source building blocks (or âflexible infrastructureâ) used in
     areas such as digital identity, registries, messaging, or interoperability layers can be
     reused and adapted across institutions and borders, enabling multi-vendor sourcing and
     reducing dependence on a single supplierâs roadmap or licensing model11. This
     strengthens digital sovereignty while improving resilience and upgradeability.

    Open source also enables upstream security improvements that benefit all downstream
    users simultaneously. Targeted maintenance and security hardening of widely used
    libraries and infrastructure components reduces systemic risk across multiple public
    services, rather than shifting risk between proprietary vendors. While transition and
    integration costs exist, sustained investment in shared open-source components lowers
    total cost of ownership over time by avoiding repeated licensing, duplicated
    development, and crisis-driven remediation following security incidents or vendor
    withdrawal.

    Key assessment factors: switching and exit costs, standards compliance, supplier
    concentration, maintenance activity, vulnerability management capacity, total cost of
    ownership.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
   development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
   technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

    Strengthen and scale the existing Sovereign Tech Fund
    Calls to establish an EU-level Sovereign Tech Fund reflect the demonstrated success of
    the existing Sovereign Tech Fund, in operation since 2022. Established by the German
    government and operated by the Sovereign Tech Agency, it already functions in practice
    as a European mechanism for securing and maintaining critical open-source
    components used across the EU and globally. The issue at stake is therefore not the
    absence of a European Sovereign Tech Fund, but how the existing and proven
    instrument is recognised and reinforced in line with past EU Open Source Strategies and
    the forthcoming Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy. With the establishment of the Digital
    Commons EDIC, in which the Sovereign Tech Agency is active on behalf of Germany, an
    EU-level framework for coordinated investment in shared digital commons and
    infrastructure is now in place.

    Experience demonstrates that building an effective, upstream, maintainer-centric
    funding mechanism cannot be achieved quickly through the creation of new structures.
    Establishing additional EU-level funds or agencies would risk duplicating an already
    functioning instrument, slowing delivery, and dispersing scarce expertise, while offering
    no clear added value in terms of security or resilience. Action at EU level should
    therefore focus on scaling what already works.

    In practice, the Sovereign Tech Fund contracts upstream maintenance, security
    hardening, and stewardship work for critical open-source components that underpin
    public-sector and commercial digital systems. Evidence shows that under-maintenance
    of widely used open-source dependencies is a source of cybersecurity and resilience

                                                                                                                6

Sovereign Tech Agency GmbH Â· Gartenstr. 7 Â· 10115 Berlin Â· Germany

     risk.12 Procuring maintenance and security work at the software infrastructure layer
     delivers high leverage relative to cost.13

     The Sovereign Tech Fund should be used as the primary vehicle for EU-level investment
     in the maintenance and security of critical open-source infrastructure, aligned with
     priorities under NIS2, the Cyber Resilience Act, and the technological sovereignty
     agenda. The DC-EDIC could serve as an appropriate coordination and relay mechanism,
     avoiding the creation of parallel structures while enabling EU funding to be deployed
     rapidly and effectively.

     Prioritise open source in public procurement and digital government
     Issue EU-level procurement guidance and model clauses that enable contracting for
     maintenance, upstream contribution, and long-term support, rather than only feature
     delivery. Procurement frameworks should support multi-vendor sourcing, reuse of open-
     source digital building blocks, and exit-friendly arrangements to reduce lock-in.
     Procurement is one of the EUâs strongest demand-side levers. Without reform, open-
     source adoption risks being re-captured into proprietary service models that undermine
     sustainability and technological sovereignty. EU-level action could therefore focus on
     lowering structural procurement barriers by developing:
     â¢ reusable model contracts;
     â¢ practical evaluation guidance for procurement officers on security, interoperability,
        governance, and sustainability of open-source solutions and vendors;
     â¢ shared registries or directories of evaluated open-source solutions and components
        (building on existing national or European initiatives), to support reuse and reduce
        duplication of assessment efforts.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

     Security-Critical Infrastructure
     Encryption implementations, authentication systems, and core cryptographic libraries
     should be the EU's top investment priority. These components protect every layer of
     digital society and economy yet are chronically underfunded relative to their importance,
     often maintained by small teams despite being embedded in millions of systems.14 15
     Simultaneously, the emergence of quantum computing requires proactive migration to
     quantum-resistant algorithms. Investments should also support modernisation of legacy
     security code where needed, as older implementations often lack the architectural
     flexibility to integrate post-quantum algorithms, carry expanded attack surfaces from

     deprecated features, and impose maintenance burdens that discourage new
     contributors. Code modernisation efforts should also consider sustainability, audibility
     and memory-safety.

     Software Security and Regulatory Compliance Infrastructure
     Package managers, dependency resolution systems, and software bill of materials
     (SBOM) tooling form chokepoints where a single vulnerability can cascade to millions of
     downstream applications.16 This priority gains urgency with the Cyber Resilience Act and
     related legislation, which create new requirements for vulnerability disclosure, security
     maintenance, and supply chain transparency for products incorporating open-source
     components. Public investment serves a dual purpose: improving baseline security while
     helping European open source sector meet compliance obligations without the burden
     falling on under-resourced maintainers. Funding reproducible builds tooling, SBOM
     generation, and secure package distribution ensures regulatory requirements translate
     into sustainable security improvements.

     Operating System Foundations and Embedded Systems Tooling
     Core operating system components and tooling for embedded systems development
     underpin government IT, cloud computing, and connected devices across automotive,
     medical, industrial, and telecommunications sectors. A significant share of global
     internet traffic flows through networking equipment built with open-source embedded
     systems tooling, and virtually every server depends on the same set of core operating
     system components.17 Public investment scales efficiently because improvements
     benefit all downstream users across sectors simultaneously, while reducing Europe's
     dependence on proprietary alternatives.

     Open Standards and Reference Implementations
     Open standards are only as valuable as the implementations that bring them to life.
     Without high-quality, freely available reference implementations, standards risk
     remaining paper exercises or becoming captured by vendors who control the dominant
     proprietary implementations.18 The EU should focus on investments in developing and
     maintaining open-source reference implementations for strategically important
     protocols and data formats, particularly in areas such as digital identity, secure
     communications, document interchange, and federated services. These reference
     implementations serve multiple functions: they validate that standards are
     implementable, provide a baseline against which compliance can be tested, lower
     barriers to entry for the European Software sector, and ensure that interoperability
     remains grounded in publicly auditable code rather than dependent on any single

     vendor's interpretation. This approach also strengthens Europe's voice in international
     standards bodies, where standards often follow implementation capacity.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
   competitiveness and cyber resilience?

     The greatest competitiveness and resilience gains arise in sectors characterised by high
     dependency on shared software components, long system lifecycles, and asymmetric
     risk between upstream maintenance and downstream use.

     Cloud, edge, data, and AI-dependent industries.
     Open source underpins most cloud, data, and AI stacks. Increased use of open source
     reduces dependency on dominant non-EU platforms, supports competition in services
     and deployment, and lowers systemic risk through shared maintenance of widely reused
     components.

     Critical infrastructure sectors (energy, transport, communications).
     These sectors increasingly rely on software-intensive systems built on shared open-
     source dependencies.19 Given the high prevalence of outdated and under-maintained
     components cited in industry audits, upstream investment in open-source maintenance
     and security has a direct impact on operational resilience and supply-chain security in
     safety-critical environments.

     Public administration and digital government.
     Open source enables interoperability, reuse across administrations and borders, and
     greater control over maintenance and securityâkey factors for resilience and long-term
     cost efficiency.20 Public procurement can also act as a powerful demand-side lever:
     empirical evidence from national procurement policies that explicitly favoured open
     source shows that sustained public demand can increase upstream contributions, firm-
     level adoption, start-up formation, and employment, with productivity and
     competitiveness gains accruing domestically.21 This demonstrates that digital
     government can actively shape resilient open-source ecosystems when procurement is
     used strategically.
