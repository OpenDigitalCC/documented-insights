Executive Summary

The Foundation for Public Code welcomes this opportunity to respond to the Commission's Call for
Evidence on European Open Digital Ecosystems. We share the Commission's assessment that the EU faces
significant challenges in achieving technological sovereignty and that open source offers a compelling path
forward.

Our response focuses on a proven organizational modelâthe Public Product Organization (PPO)âthat
directly addresses many of the barriers identified by the Commission. PPOs provide a sustainable
framework for public organizations and their vendors to collaboratively develop, maintain, and govern
shared open-source solutions, transforming the economics of digital public infrastructure.

We propose that the Commission consider issuing directives to Member States establishing the Public
Product Organization as a new recognized nonprofit organizational formâa dedicated legal vehicle
purpose-built for the collaborative stewardship of digital public goods. This would provide the structural
foundation needed for sustainable, cross-border collaboration on shared digital infrastructure.

Based on our experience stewarding codebases for public organizations across Europe, we offer concrete
recommendations for EU-level actions that would accelerate the adoption of collaborative open-source
development models and strengthen the EU's open-source ecosystem.

About the Foundation for Public Code

The Foundation for Public Code is a non-profit organization that provides codebase stewardship services
to help public organizations collaboratively develop and maintain open-source software. We support public
administrations, their vendors, and open-source communities in building sustainable digital public
infrastructure.

Our core activities include: quality auditing of source code against the Standard for Public Code; nurturing
developer communities; strengthening governance models; and helping public organizations understand
how to effectively collaborate on shared digital products. We are uniquely positioned as an impartial
stewardâdistinct from vendors selling services, activist groups lobbying governments, or foundations
serving primarily private-sector projects.

Response to Question 1: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Barriers in the EU
Open-Source Sector
Strengths

The EU possesses significant strengths in the open-source domain. European developer communities are
among the most active worldwide, and their work aligns closely with EU values of transparency, privacy,
and digital rights. The Commission has correctly identified that open source represents 70â90% of modern
software foundations, demonstrating its central role in the digital economy.

Several EU Member States have made substantial progress in adopting open source for government
processes. The creation of the European Digital Infrastructure Consortium for Digital Commons
demonstrates growing political will for collaborative approaches. These foundations provide a strong basis
for scaling successful models across the Union.

Weaknesses and Barriers

However, the EU open-source sector faces critical structural barriers that prevent it from realizing its full
potential:

â¢ Governance Gap: Many promising open-source projects lack the governance structures needed for
sustainable multi-stakeholder collaboration. Without clear decision-making processes, roadmap ownership,
and conflict resolution mechanisms, projects struggle to attract institutional adopters.

â¢ Sustainability Crisis: Research and innovation funding alone has proven insufficient for successful
upscaling. Projects that demonstrate technical excellence often fail to achieve market integration because
they lack ongoing maintenance capacity and community support infrastructure.

â¢ Fragmented Procurement: Public procurement practices remain biased toward proprietary solutions.
Procurement officers often lack the frameworks and knowledge to evaluate open-source alternatives, and
existing procurement rules may inadvertently disadvantage collaborative development models.

â¢ Value Capture Outside EU: While EU developers contribute significantly to open-source projects, much
of the commercial value is captured by non-EU technology giants who build proprietary services on top of
open foundations.

â¢ Missing Middle Layer: There is a gap between individual contributors/small projects and large-scale
adoption. The EU lacks sufficient organizational infrastructureâneutral stewards, shared hosting,
community facilitationâto bridge this gap.

How Public Product Organizations Address These Barriers

The Public Product Organization (PPO) model directly addresses these structural barriers by providing a
proven framework for sustainable, collaborative development of open-source public infrastructure:

A PPO is a co-governed organizational vehicleâtypically structured as a non-profitâthrough which multiple
public administrations and their vendors collaboratively develop, maintain, and steward shared digital
products. The model includes:

â¢ Externalized Governance: Clear decision-making structures with both technical and product steering
teams, ensuring that governance does not depend on any single organization.

â¢ Continuous Stewardship: Dedicated capacity for code maintenance, security updates, documentation,
and community facilitationâfunded collectively by members.

â¢ Shared Investment Model: Development costs are distributed across multiple implementing
organizations, making ambitious projects economically viable for each participant.
â¢ Vendor Ecosystem: PPOs create a 'reef' of opportunity for EU SMEsâlocal integrators, software studios,
and support providersâbuilding services on the 'coral' of common core public products.

Response to Question 2: Added Value of Open Source for Public and
Private Sectors

The value proposition of open sourceâparticularly when developed through collaborative PPO
structuresâextends well beyond cost savings. Based on our experience supporting public organizations, we
identify the following key value drivers:

Sovereignty and Strategic Control

Open-source solutions developed through PPOs give public organizations genuine control over their digital
infrastructure. Unlike proprietary solutions where the vendor controls the roadmap, PPO members
collectively determine development priorities, ensuring that software evolves to meet public-sector needs
rather than commercial imperatives. This is essential for technological sovereigntyâthe ability to make
autonomous decisions about critical digital systems.

Reduced Vendor Lock-in and Supply Chain Risk

Proprietary systems create dependencies that limit future options and expose organizations to supply chain
risks. When a vendor changes strategy, raises prices, or ceases operations, dependent organizations face
difficult and expensive transitions. Open-source solutionsâespecially those maintained through PPOs with
multiple active implementersâprovide genuine alternatives and migration paths. The collaborative
governance model ensures no single entity can unilaterally discontinue or fundamentally alter the product.

Economic Efficiency Through Shared Investment
The PPO model transforms the economics of public-sector software. Rather than each administration
independently purchasing and customizing proprietary solutions, multiple organizations share the cost of
developing and maintaining common functionality. Our experience shows that organizations participating in
collaborative development achieve significant cost reductions while gaining access to higher-quality
solutions than they could afford independently.

Enhanced Security Through Transparency

Open-source code enables independent security review and rapid vulnerability response. The transparency
of development processesâtracked through version control, reviewed through public pull requests, and
documented in open issue trackersâprovides verifiable assurance that proprietary 'black boxes' cannot
match. PPOs strengthen this further by providing dedicated capacity for security maintenance and
coordinated disclosure.

Innovation and Adaptability

Public organizations can adapt open-source solutions to their specific contexts without waiting for vendor
approval or paying for custom development. Innovations developed by one organization can be contributed
back to the shared codebase, benefiting all participants. This creates a virtuous cycle of improvement
where the collective investment continuously enhances the shared product.
Response to Question 3: Recommended EU-Level Measures and Actions

Based on our practical experience supporting public organizations in collaborative open-source
development, we recommend the following concrete measures at EU level:

1. Issue a Directive Establishing the Public Product Organization as a Recognized
Nonprofit Form

The most impactful action the Commission could take would be to issue a directive to Member States
establishing the Public Product Organization (PPO) as a new, harmonized nonprofit organizational form
specifically designed for the collaborative stewardship of digital public goods. This would create the legal
and institutional foundation for sustainable cross-border collaboration on shared digital infrastructure.

Such a directive should establish:

â¢ A defined legal form recognized across all Member States, enabling PPOs to operate seamlessly across
jurisdictions without complex multi-country legal structures

â¢ Governance requirements ensuring democratic participation by member public organizations,
transparent decision-making, and accountability to the public interest

â¢ Membership criteria specifying that controlling membership is limited to public organizations (wholly
publicly owned entities), while allowing participation by vendors, foundations, and other stakeholders in
defined roles

â¢ Intellectual property provisions ensuring that code and documentation produced by PPOs remains freely
available as open source, preventing privatization of collectively-funded public goods

â¢ Fiscal frameworks enabling PPOs to receive funding from multiple Member States and EU programmes,
with appropriate tax treatment reflecting their public-interest mission

This directive would address a fundamental gap in the current landscape: while public organizations
increasingly recognize the value of collaborative open-source development, they lack appropriate
organizational vehicles to formalize such collaboration. Existing nonprofit forms (associations, foundations,
cooperatives) were not designed for the continuous, technically-intensive work of codebase stewardship. A
purpose-built PPO form would dramatically lower the barriers to establishing sustainable collaborative
arrangements.

2. Establish Funding Mechanisms for Public Product Organizations

Alongside the legal framework, the Commission should create dedicated funding mechanisms to support
the formation and operation of PPOs:

â¢ Seed funding for the 'barnraising' phase where multiple public organizations come together to prototype
shared solutions

â¢ Operational support for ongoing stewardship activities including code maintenance, security,
documentation, and community facilitation

â¢ Support for both the 'doula' pattern (helping successful single-organization projects find replicating peers)
and the 'barnraising' pattern (collaborative development from inception)
â¢ Transition funding to help existing informal collaborations formalize into recognized PPO structures once
the directive is transposed

3. Reform Public Procurement to Enable Collaborative Development

Current procurement practices often inadvertently disadvantage open-source solutions. The Commission
should:

â¢ Develop procurement guidance specifically addressing how to evaluate and acquire open-source
solutions and participate in collaborative development

â¢ Create model contract clauses that ensure public contributions to open-source projects remain openly
available

â¢ Encourage Member States to adopt 'public money, public code' policies requiring that publicly-funded
software be released as open source

â¢ Support joint procurement mechanisms enabling multiple administrations to collectively fund shared
development, including through recognized PPOs

4. Invest in EU-Based Codebase Stewardship Infrastructure

The EU needs organizational infrastructure to support sustainable open-source development:

â¢ Support for EU-based stewardship organizations (like the Foundation for Public Code) that provide
impartial codebase stewardship services to PPOs

â¢ Investment in shared hosting infrastructureâEU-sovereign code repositories, continuous integration
systems, and collaboration platforms

â¢ Development of quality standards (building on the Standard for Public Code) that help organizations
assess open-source readiness

â¢ Capacity building for community facilitation skills within public administrations

5. Create an SME-Enabling Ecosystem

The PPO model creates opportunities for a thriving ecosystem of EU SMEs. The Commission should:

â¢ Support SME participation in PPO governance and development through dedicated programmes

â¢ Create certification frameworks recognizing SME expertise in implementing and supporting specific
public-code products stewarded by PPOs

â¢ Develop marketplace mechanisms connecting public organizations with qualified local vendors

â¢ Fund training programmes helping SMEs build capacity in open-source business models and PPO
collaboration

Priority Technology Areas and Sectors (Questions 4â5)

The PPO model is applicable across multiple technology domains and sectors. Based on our experience and
the Commission's strategic priorities, we highlight the following areas where collaborative open-source
development could deliver significant impact:
â¢ Digital Government Services: Case management, permit systems, citizen portals, and administrative
workflow tools used across all levels of government

â¢ Data Infrastructure: Tools for data spaces, open data platforms, and interoperability frameworks essential
for the EU's data strategy

â¢ AI and Machine Learning: Open AI models and supporting infrastructure that ensure EU organizations
have sovereign alternatives to proprietary AI services

â¢ Cybersecurity: Security tools, vulnerability management systems, and identity infrastructure

â¢ Edge Computing and IoT: Infrastructure for smart cities and connected public services

Sectors with strong potential for increased competitiveness and resilience through open source include:
public administration at all levels, healthcare, education, transportation, and utilities. These sectors share
common functional requirements across jurisdictions, making them ideal candidates for PPO-based
collaborative development.

Conclusion

The Commission's initiative on European Open Digital Ecosystems represents an important opportunity to
strengthen the EU's technological sovereignty and competitiveness. The Public Product Organization model
offers a proven approach to addressing the structural barriers that have limited the EU's ability to capture
the full value of open-source development.

By investing in the organizational infrastructure for collaborative developmentâPPO formation support,
procurement reform, stewardship capacity, and SME ecosystem developmentâthe EU can transform its
relationship with open source from passive consumption to active, sovereign participation.

The Foundation for Public Code stands ready to support the Commission in developing and implementing
these measures. We welcome further dialogue and would be pleased to share detailed case studies and
lessons learned from our codebase stewardship work.
