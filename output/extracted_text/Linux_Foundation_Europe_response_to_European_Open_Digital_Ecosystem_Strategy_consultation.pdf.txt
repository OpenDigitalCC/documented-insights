Linux Foundation Europeâs response to the
European Commissionâs public consultation:

European Open Digital Ecosystems
Strategy
Contact: Paula Grzegorzewska, paula@linuxfoundation.eu

Linux Foundation Europe welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the public
consultation on the European Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy. As the European chapter
of the Linux Foundation, we represent the largest global collaboration on open
technologies, including essential open source software projects like Linux, OpenStack,
Kubernetes, PyTorch, MCP, open hardware projects like RISC-V, open standards
development initiatives like SPDX and C2PA and open data initiatives like Overture Maps.
We support the Commissionâs ambition to strengthen Europeâs open source ecosystem
and urge sustained, long-term commitment and concrete mechanisms that will help
achieve these goals.

Key points
 1.â Open source is a basis of successful business ventures and widely used throughout
     industries. Most modern software is based on open source, whether proprietary or not.
     Open source should be understood as a diverse ecosystem that includes multiple
     governance, sustainability, and commercial models and is a backbone of a significant
     share of the economy. Linux Foundation welcomes the Call for Evidence documentâs
     acknowledgment of this reality and supports its pursuit of pragmatic, evidence-based
     approaches that can operationalise the benefits of open technology into gains for EUâs
     competitiveness and technological autonomy.

 2.â Europe should build on and influence the global Open Source commons, rather than
     pursue isolated notions of âEuropean Open Source.â Leveraging existing global projects
     and communities offers the fastest and most realistic path toward EU objectives on
     technological sovereignty and strategic autonomy. The technologies underpinning cloud,
     AI and emerging digital infrastructure already exist as openly governed global projects.
     Fragmented, Europe-only initiatives dilute impact and slow progress. Strategic upstream
     investment and participation in global commons maximises ROI, accelerates innovation,
     and strengthens Europeâs ability to shape critical technologies. There is insufficient time,
     funding, and talent capacity to recreate these ecosystems from scratch. The United
     States and China have been building their capacity in open source through commercial
     (estimated to be $7.7B/year) and public investments, respectively, for the past two
     decades and achieved great results that can inform Europeâs strategic plans for
     achieving digital sovereignty.

 3.â Scaling local commercial Open Source companies should be a core policy priority.
     Product and services companies built around open source should be included in the
     investment concepts of funding instruments such as the ScaleUp Fund, European
     Innovation Council programs, initiatives removing barriers to enter European markets
     such as EU Inc, as well as other industrial policy mechanisms in order to accelerate
     growth, enable global competition and retain European talent. Recent research from LF
     Research, Commercial Open Source Startup Alliance (COSSA) and Serena shows that
     Commercial Open Source (COSS) companies outperform closed-source peers in
     fundraising speed and both early stage and exit valuations. Commercial open source
     ecosystems can also be stimulated on the demand side by updating procurement

    Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
     practices, for instance in the upcoming Procurement Directive. Linux Foundation Europe
     feedback to the consultation.

  4.â Critical Open Source infrastructure should be hosted under neutral governance.
      Neutral hosting is essential to ensure balanced decision-making and to mitigate
      single-vendor risks, including licence changes, the creation of new vendor lock-ins, or
      risks linked to foreign acquisitions as well as foster rapid organic de facto
      standardization. This approach has been proven to sustain and grow large open source
      projects, often allowing competitors to collaborate on crucial and innovative technology
      and providing a basis for further development. Both the collaborative communities that
      create and steward open source software and the commercial ventures that monetise it
      require a neutral platform for scalable global collaboration, long-term stewardship, and
      connecting projects, industry, and public sector. The Linux Foundation and other open
      source foundations bring decades of experience in scaling and sustaining critical open
      source projects and would welcome continued collaboration with the European
      Commission. Such a collaboration with foundations would support EU objectives - by
      building on the existing global commons, sharing best practices, leveraging established
      projects and services, and, where appropriate, creating new local EU structures.

Question 1: What are the strengths and weaknesses
of the EU open-source sector?
Strengths
  ââ European developers play a significant role in global open source projects, contributing
     to the technologies that enable most of the EUâs digital infrastructure, where 70â90% of
     code relies on open source.
  ââ Europe ranks second in the number of developers, as shown by the latest GitHub data,
     and takes the lead in the number of contributions.
  ââ The open source community reflects core European values - transparency, accountability,
     and interoperability - while also serving as a recognized pillar of digital sovereignty,
     helping prevent vendor lock-in.

     Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
  ââ The EU has been at the forefront of integrating open source into regulatory frameworks,
     as exemplified by concepts such as the âopen source software stewardsâ in the Cyber
     Resilience Act, a step toward strengthening Europeâs digital security and autonomy.
  ââ The European public sector has been increasingly engaged in the strategic use of open
     source, with notable examples from France, the Netherlands, Germany, and other
     countries at local, regional, national, and European levels.

Weaknesses
  ââ Many European companies still consume open source without contributing
     proportionally, resulting in weak influence over critical technologies they depend on.
     European enterprises must move from passive consumption to active contribution and
     governance participation to reduce supply-chain risk, influence roadmaps, and regain
     strategic control over critical digital infrastructure. There are no European companies
     among the top 10 commercial organizations ranked by the volume of their employeesâ
     year-to-date open-source contributions on GitHub.
  ââ Europeâs commercial open source scale-up pipeline remains underdeveloped, making it
     difficult to turn strong open source projects into globally competitive product and
     services companies, as well as retain talented European founders, especially when
     compared to the US.
  ââ Despite strong evidence of superior exits, commercial open source is not a critical part
     of European investment strategy. The business and investment climate encourages
     founders to seek regions with larger venture capital pools and more attractive exit
     opportunities, leaving European open source business development lagging behind.
  ââ Attempts to fragment or regionalise open source efforts risk isolating Europe from
     global ecosystems, reducing upstream influence and slowing innovation. Initiatives such
     as âSoftware made in Europeâ risk limiting scale-up potential and discouraging
     participation in existing global projects, thereby forgoing accumulated expertise, good
     practices and talent. This is particularly detrimental for large European industries who
     are global in nature and leverage the global commons in their technology stacks.
  ââ Despite substantial EU investment, public funding remains spread across disconnected
     projects, overlapping initiatives and national silos, limiting scale, impact, and global
     influence. Future funding should focus on fewer, strategically selected projects with
     global relevance, coordinated governance, and clear pathways to adoption and
     sustainability.

     Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
Question 2: What is the added value of open source
for the public and private sectors?
Open source delivers critical value to the public sector by reducing vendor lock-in, enhancing
auditability, and increasing transparency across software supply chains. By participating
upstream in global projects, governments and institutions can build technical capabilities,
influence how software evolves, and ensure alignment with regulations and policy priorities.
Open source also enables cross-border collaboration and reuse, as demonstrated by initiatives
like the EU OSPO Network and the Digital Sovereignty European Digital Infrastructure
Consortium, where municipalities, federal agencies, and even multiple countries can contribute
and share solutions.

One of the examples illustrating the benefits of open source in the public sector is the
adaptation of PyPowSyBl components by Baltic RCC. The Linux Foundation would be happy to
share additional case studies and examples from across diverse verticals, public and private
sectors, geographies and use cases.

 Baltic RCC: Open Source for Interoperable, Compliant Grid Operations

 Baltic RCC, the Regional Coordination Center responsible for electricity system security in the
 Baltic region, faced growing complexity as Europeâs power grid became more interconnected
 and renewable-heavy. To meet EU regulatory requirements (EU 2019/943) for a Pan-European
 network model, while avoiding vendor lock-in and long-term dependencies, Baltic RCC chose
 an open source, community-driven approach rather than proprietary software. It adopted
 components from LF Energyâs PowSyBl project, notably PyPowSyBl, to merge network
 models from multiple Transmission System Operators (TSOs), manage CGMES data
 exchanges, and run critical load-flow and âwhat-ifâ stability analyses needed for cross-border
 coordination.

 By building a modular architecture on open standards and open source tools (including open
 message brokering, storage, and visualization components), Baltic RCC retained full control
 over its systems while ensuring interoperability across organizations and borders. The result
 is a compliant, operational Pan-European network model that supports grid resilience,

       Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
 regulatory oversight, and future evolution without dependence on a single vendor. This case
 demonstrates how open source technology can act as a digital public good for the energy
 sector, supporting interoperability, transparency, and long-term sustainability in line with EU
 digital government and infrastructure objectives.

In the private sector, open source accelerates innovation, lowers infrastructure costs, and levels
the playing field for companies of all sizes, particularly SMEs, by providing access to globally
recognized standards and technology. By contributing to and engaging with upstream projects,
companies gain influence over the direction of foundational technologies rather than simply
consuming them. While acceptance depends on maintainer review and community consensus
under open governance, businesses can pay engineers to work on specific features, thereby
shaping which areas receive the most attention and development.

Commercial open source software often outperforms proprietary alternatives, attracting
investment and enabling firms to compete on quality, scalability, and innovation. Participation in
open source ecosystems also mitigates dependency risks, fosters collaboration with leading
global talent, and ensures that European companies remain strategically relevant in a
competitive international market. Rather than creating isolated âEuropean-onlyâ software,
participation in these ecosystems strengthens digital sovereignty.

Economics of interdependence
Open source forms the foundation of nearly all modern digital ecosystems, with most
proprietary software built on open layers that are maintained and governed collaboratively. Its
economic impact is substantial: European contributions to open source are estimated to
generate â¬65â95 billion annually for EU GDP, while replacing existing open source components
globally would cost $8.8 trillion. Value is created on top of the open layer, not by attempting to
replicate it through closed, âEU-exclusiveâ alternatives. True sovereignty and competitiveness
come from participation, influence, and open governance, allowing Europe to shape the global
commons rather than be constrained by it. By embedding open source at the heart of policy,
business, and public infrastructure, Europe can accelerate innovation, maintain resilience, and
secure strategic autonomy across critical sectors.

       Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
Question 4: What technology areas should be
prioritised and why?
The beneficial impact of open source has been shown in a variety of sectors. The Linux
Foundation is uniquely positioned, hosting many of the largest and most influential projects
across diverse technology areas, often with European leadership. Our Open Source Index and
Landscape showcase these projects, together with numbers of contributors, health metrics of
the community, software value and other indicators, categorised by technologies and industries.
Such data offers insight into market dynamics and the influence of these projects. Some of the
priority technology areas could include:

   ââ   Cloud, edge, and telco infrastructure
   ââ   AI frameworks and tooling (not just models)
   ââ   Cybersecurity tooling and software supply chain
   ââ   Digital identity and wallets
   ââ   Industrial and automotive software stacks
   ââ   Open hardware (RISC-V, embedded systems)

However, such prioritisation should take place after detailed analysis based on a comparable
EU-level approach. A robust evidence base is needed on concentration and lock-in across the
technology stack, interdependencies between components and vendors, the actual use and
maturity of open source alternatives, and the implications of different strategic choices. This
requires structured, ongoing data collection and dependency mapping across key domains,
such as those mentioned above, to understand where open source is already viable, where
dependencies concentrate around critical projects or actors, and where ecosystem weaknesses
create systemic risk.

On this basis, the EU can credibly prioritise technology areas over time, focusing investment on
strengthening upstream open source components and enabling substitution and modularity
where strategic dependencies are most acute. For instance, many larger open source projects
that are de facto standards do not necessarily need financial support, but would benefit from
greater participation of European players to increase influence, while smaller or more critical
foundation projects should be directly funded and supported via mechanisms such as the
proposed European Sovereign Tech Fund.

NeoNephos: sovereign cloud native technology

NeoNephos is an open source initiative established by the Linux Foundation Europe under the
IPCEI-CIS (Important Project of Common European Interest on Cloud Infrastructure and
Services) framework. The project aims to provide a shared foundation for Europeâs
cloud-to-edge infrastructure, addressing regulatory, security, and interoperability requirements.
Its governance brings together technology companies, research institutions, and cloud
providers - including SAP SE, Deutsche Telekom AG, CLYSO GmbH, and TNO ECOFED - to
collaboratively develop cloud-native technologies based on open standards.

The project focuses on key areas such as open cloud infrastructure, digital sovereignty, and
collaborative development. By using and adapting existing open source components,
NeoNephos enables faster deployment, reduces duplication of effort, and ensures
transparency and auditability of the software stack. These characteristics are important for
European organizations seeking to maintain control over their data and infrastructure while
complying with EU regulations.

NeoNephos also functions as a shared resource for other IPCEI-CIS projects, supporting
interoperability and providing reusable tools and standards that reduce development costs
and accelerate innovation. Its architecture and project portfolio build on upstream initiatives
such as Sylva Project, whose work on telco-grade cloud and edge frameworks has provided
important foundational concepts and reference approaches.

By aligning multiple initiatives under a common open source framework, the project
demonstrates how coordinated, community-driven development can support Europeâs digital
sovereignty objectives.

Question 5: In what sectors could an increased use
of open source lead to increased competitiveness
and cyber resilience?
Decisions on sectors of focus for increasing competitiveness and cyber resilience should be
based on extensive research and analysis of industry data throughout verticals, and framed
within a coherent policy framework aligned with EU strategic objectives, including technological
sovereignty, security and competitiveness. Existing frameworks, notably the NIS2 Directive,
already provide a strong reference point for identifying sectors where increased use of open
source can most directly enhance competitiveness.

Across both Essential Entities (such as energy, digital infrastructure, and public administration)
and Important Entities (manufacturing, food, digital services and research) organisations face
similar structural constraints: heavy reliance on a small number of proprietary vendors, limited
insight into software supply chains, escalating costs, and long-term lock-in. These challenges
are amplified by high dependency risks, long lifecycle software, and a strong need for
interoperability and trust in critical systems.

    Case study â Sovereign Open Source Cloud Infrastructure

    A good example is NUBO, a sovereign cloud operated by the French Ministry of the Economy
    and Finance and built using open source technologies from the OpenInfra Foundation,
    especially OpenStack. By adopting an open source cloud stack, NUBO reduced dependency
    on proprietary vendors, improved transparency and auditability, and strengthened control over
    its software supply chain. The project demonstrates how open source infrastructure can
    enhance cyber resilience, limit vendor lock-in, and support digital sovereignty in critical
    public-sector systems, while remaining compatible with stringent national security and
    compliance requirements.

â
â

          Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
Open source helps address these issues by enabling modular and interoperable systems that
lower switching costs and reduce barriers to market entry, supporting a more diverse and
competitive supplier ecosystem, including European SMEs and service providers. This is
particularly relevant in sectors such as energy, digital infrastructure and public services, where
reducing vendor concentration can directly translate into increased innovation, cost efficiency
and strategic autonomy.

Beyond these core sectors, industry evidence shows that open source is increasingly enhancing
competitiveness and cyber resilience across a wider range of NIS2-relevant verticals. In finance,
open collaboration around data models, interoperability standards and AI controls reduces
systemic risk, improves auditability and lowers barriers for new entrants in a traditionally
vendor-concentrated market.

 Spring Bot Case Study - Deutsche Bank

 Financial services provide a clear example of how increased use of open source can
 strengthen competitiveness and cyber resilience while supporting digital sovereignty. One
 example is the case study from FINOS on Deutsche Bank, which documents the use of the
 open source Spring Bot framework to automate internal developer communications and
 workflows.

 By adopting and contributing to an open source solution, Deutsche Bank reduced dependency
 on proprietary tooling, improved transparency and auditability of internal systems, and
 strengthened its ability to assess and manage security risks. This approach supports digital
 sovereignty by enabling greater control over critical software components, reducing vendor
 lock-in, and allowing security practices to be adapted to regulatory and institutional
 requirements. The case demonstrates how open source adoption in the financial sector can
 enhance operational efficiency, resilience, and trust, key factors for maintaining Europeâs
 competitiveness in highly regulated and security-sensitive domains.

Similar dynamics are visible in manufacturing, energy and mobility. Software-defined vehicles,
industrial platforms and safety-critical systems increasingly rely on open operating systems and
reference implementations, allowing manufacturers to focus investment on differentiation while
benefiting from shared security and safety engineering. Examples include Automotive Grade

       Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
Linux (AGL) for infotainment systems; ELISA, which develops guidance and tooling to enable
Linux in safety-critical applications such as medical, aerospace, and automotive; and the Zephyr
Project, an open source real-time operating system for resource-constrained devices.

 Zephyr project addressing functional safety

 The Zephyr Project is an open source project developing a small, scalable real-time operating
 system (RTOS) optimised for resource-constrained and embedded devices across multiple
 hardware architectures. It brings together silicon vendors, OEMs, and software providers
 under a neutral governance model to reduce development costs, improve interoperability, and
 accelerate time to market for connected devices, while offering a high degree of
 configurability, security, and long-term support.

 The talk âZephyr: Learnings From Working on Safety Certification in the Openâ by Kate Stewart
 (The Linux Foundation) describes the projectâs approach to safety, including the achievement
 of IEC 61508 concept approval in December 2024, ongoing work toward IEC 61508 and ISO
 26262 certification, and the roadmap through 2026. This presentation provides useful insight
 into how an open source RTOS like the Zephyr Project is addressing functional safety and is
 recommended viewing for those interested in this topic.

In energy, open source has moved into production use for digital substations, grid management
and EV charging, enabling interoperability across vendors, open security testing and faster
adaptation to regulatory and technological change. Across these sectors, open source supports
both competitiveness and cyber resilience by reducing dependency on proprietary platforms,
improving visibility into software supply chains, and fostering more diverse and innovative
ecosystems.

For cybersecurity, the transparency and auditability of open source software, combined with
shared maintenance and peer review and coordinated vulnerability disclosure, are directly
aligned with the EUâs risk-based cybersecurity approach as reflected in the NIS2 Directive, the
Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and the EU Cybersecurity Strategy. These characteristics enable
earlier detection and faster remediation of vulnerabilities across the software lifecycle -
provided that open source ecosystems are adequately governed, sustainably-resourced and
supported by professional security processes.

       Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
In contrast to opaque proprietary software stacks, open source components allow continuous
assessment of code integrity, security-by-design practices and traceability of software
dependencies, which are central objectives of current EU cybersecurity policy. This is
particularly relevant in the context of software supply chain security, where NIS2, DORA and the
CRA emphasise risk management, dependency awareness and incident prevention across
interconnected systems. Open source enables systematic mapping and monitoring of
dependencies, supporting the production and maintenance of software bills of materials
(SBOMs) and facilitating compliance with emerging regulatory requirements.

Targeting critical upstream dependencies, sometimes maintained by a small number of
contributors, enables high-leverage interventions that significantly reduce systemic cyber risk.
Strategic support for these dependencies through coordinated funding, security audits,
long-term maintenance programmes and trusted governance structures can prevent single
points of failure, reduce exposure to large-scale vulnerabilities, and improve incident response
coordination across the Union.

 Such an approach helps avoid fragmented or âbuild-from-scratchâ solutions that increase attack
surfaces, dilute security expertise, and create inconsistent security postures across sectors.
Instead, it promotes the consolidation of security efforts around well-governed, widely adopted,
and continuously maintained open source components, delivering resilience benefits that
propagate across the entire software ecosystem, including critical infrastructure, public services
and industrial systems.

By embedding open source within EU cybersecurity policy as a shared security foundation rather
than a cost-saving alternative, the Union can strengthen collective cyber resilience, improve
preparedness and response capabilities, and ensure that essential digital infrastructures are
built on transparent, verifiable and trustworthy technologies, consistent with the EUâs long-term
objectives for security, sovereignty and technological autonomy.

In this sense, open source functions as the WD-40 of competition, reducing friction, unlocking
collaboration, and enabling faster, more resilient innovation across sectors.

 Park&Charge and Qwello: Open Source as a Foundation for Resilient E-Mobility
 Infrastructure

 When responsibility for 191 aging EV chargers in the Dutch province of Gelderland changed
 hands in 2024, Park&Charge and Qwello faced a common challenge in the fast-moving EV
 market: how to modernize legacy charging infrastructure without scrapping functional
 hardware or becoming locked into unsupported proprietary technology. Many of the chargers
 relied on vendor-specific software that could no longer be maintained, creating a high risk of
 stranded assets, an increasingly familiar problem in automotive and mobility infrastructure as
 early EV technology providers exit the market. Rather than replacing the chargers outright,
 Park&Charge and Qwello pursued a circular, software-defined approach aligned with
 long-term sustainability and interoperability goals.

 By refurbishing the chargers with LF Energyâs open source EVerest software stack, combined
 with Qwelloâs PhyVERSO charge controller, the operators transformed obsolete assets into
 modern, standards-based EV charging infrastructure. EVerest provided a vendor-neutral,
 interoperable software foundation compatible with a wide range of vehicles and backend
 systems, enabling high utilization rates and a reliable driver experience while preserving most
 of the existing hardware. The result is a future-proof charging network that reduces waste,
 lowers lifecycle costs, and can evolve with the rapidly changing automotive ecosystem. This
 case shows how open source software can act as a strategic enabler for digital mobility
 infrastructure, supporting interoperability, resilience, and circular economy objectives across
 the EV charging value chain.

Throughout the NIS-2 sectors and beyond, the Linux Foundation hosts a variety of large-scale
industrial collaborations through open source such as FINOS (finance and digital payments), LF
Networking (telecommunications), LF Energy (energy), Margo (manufacturing), Agstack and
OpenAgri (European Unionâs Horizon Europe research program), to name a few.

Additional initiatives and projects of interest include: CNCF, hosting a de facto standard for
open cloud-native stacks; AI (PyTorch Foundation and AAIF); Operating systems (Linux and
Zephyr RTOS); Security and Cyber Resilience (OpenSSF and its CRA initiatives, and
Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance for quantum-safe security); LF Decentralized Trust; and in
the area of hardware and embedded systems, RISC-V International.

Question 3: What concrete measures and actions
may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source
sector and contribute to the EUâs technological
sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?
We decided to answer Question 3 at the end of this document because its response builds on the
input provided in the preceding questions. The following recommendations draw on earlier insights
and address the three goals delineated in the consultation document:
(i) encouraging greater adoption of open source by public and private users, and encouraging
organisations to contribute to open-source development;
(ii) boosting the development and competitiveness of the emerging EU open-source sector;
(iii) strengthening the position of start-ups in the innovation ecosystems.

Policy
   ââ Strengthen EU influence in global open source ecosystems: Focus on public sector and
      industries upstream contribution and active participation in existing global projects.
      Build European stacks on global open source software, with strong European
      participation and governance influence.
   ââ Promote open governance and interoperability: Support foundation-based governance
      structures over single-vendor models to ensure community-driven, long-term project
      sustainability and rapid technical integration through de-facto standardization.
   ââ Avoid fragmentation: âEuropean open sourceâ should mean European influence in the
      global ecosystem, not exclusion. Efforts to separate âEuropeanâ from âglobalâ open
      source would be impractical given the deeply interconnected nature of open technology,
      and would risk decreased security, reduced interoperability, as well as limiting access to
      the talent pool and potential positive economic impact for the EU.
   ââ Accelerate harmonization of the EU market: Reduce market friction for EU-based
      technology and open source adoption, through industrial policy incentives and initiatives
      such as EU Inc.

       Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
  ââ Procurement guidance: Update public procurement frameworks to reward not just usage
     but also upstream contribution to open source and use of interoperable technologies.
  ââ Economic impact monitoring: Establish recurring studies on the economic impact of
     open source, building on existing European Commission research, and include open
     source activity indicators in the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) to track
     progress systematically.
  ââ Create an Open Source Expert Group: Such a group would ensure continuity and
     dialogue between the European Commission and the broader open source community. It
     could connect policy measures to real software development practices and provide
     structured feedback loops between policymakers, foundations, developers, and industry
     users.

Funding
  ââ Commercialization support for open source companies in Europe. Enable clear
     pathways for scaling and international competition, create a circular economy for open
     source technologies, and integrate Commercial Open Source into key investment
     strategies and tools, such as the EU ScaleUp Fund.
  ââ Leverage venture capital and private-sector funding for open source ecosystems. EU
     policy should recognize that enterprise contributions and VC investment sustain
     upstream projects, drive thriving commercial ecosystems, reduce vendor lock-in, and
     advance EU strategic goals, complementing public funding and seed-stage support.
  ââ Create incentives for COSS companies to grow and remain in Europe. Align EU funding
     instruments with commercial open source growth, support balanced investment models
     that prevent concentration risks, and make Europe a competitive hub for open source
     entrepreneurship and international expansion.
  ââ Strategic participation in global open source commons. Fund European contributions to
     existing global projects rather than isolated Europe-only initiatives, maximizing ROI,
     accelerating innovation, and strengthening Europeâs influence on critical digital
     technologies.
  ââ Publicâprivate partnerships and neutral foundations. Promote collaboration around
     neutral, vendor-independent platforms to maximize collective benefits, reduce systemic
     risks, and ensure long-term stewardship of critical infrastructure. Build on well-tested
     and successful governance and collaboration models.

     Linux Foundation Europe | BE0757843578 | Kunstlaan 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
  ââ Fund the EU Sovereign Tech Fund. Bridge the gap in sustaining critical, foundational
     layers of the open source ecosystem, improving cybersecurity and establishing a robust
     baseline for a thriving open source ecosystem in Europe. Policy instruments should
     differentiate between critical, under-maintained projects (which need direct support and
     funding) and more mature, self-sustaining, industry projects (which need lower barriers
     to entry, reduced regulatory fragmentation, and mechanisms empowering SME, startups,
     and large enterprises alike).

Capability / Talent
  ââ Education and training: Integrate open source into university curricula, emphasizing
     independence from proprietary frameworks and strengthening foundational skills in
     Linux, OpenStack, Kubernetes, PyTorch, MCP, and similar technologies, as well as in
     cybersecurity and digital skills (e.g. Cybersecurity Skills Framework, Developing Secure
     Software, open source best practices, OSPOs)
  ââ AI and emerging tech pipeline: Build talent in critical underlying open source
     infrastructure to maintain competitiveness in AI and cloud-native technologies.
  ââ OSS literacy for policymakers and procurers: Ensure decision-makers understand open
     source principles, governance models, and the implications for procurement and digital
     sovereignty. Involve open source projects, communities and organisations in education
     efforts and mutual exchanges.
  ââ Public administration capacity: Reinforce technical expertise in public institutions to
     support open source adoption, contribution, and maintenance.

About Linux Foundation
    ââ The Linux Foundation (LF) is a global, neutral non-profit that hosts and supports open
       source projects. It operates through regional hubs worldwide, including Europe, and
       provides shared services such as legal frameworks, governance models, technical
       infrastructure, security, and community management. It is home to many technology
       horizontal and industry-vertical specific foundations enabling collaboration between
       diverse types of entities (including competitors).

    ââ The Foundation itself does not dictate technical direction or own project code; it
       creates stable conditions for open collaboration. Foundation boards focus on strategy,
       fiduciary oversight, and budgets, while technical decisions are made by project
       communities through technical steering committees and maintainers. Governance is
       designed to separate financial contribution from technical authority.

    ââ LF has more than 2,000 member organizations, with funding broadly balanced across
       regions and deliberately capped to avoid capture. Roughly 40-45% of funding comes
       from the US, 25-30% from Europe, and 18-22% from APAC, 3-5% from Latin America and
       2-4% from Middle East and Africa, no single member contributes more than about 3% of
       the total budget. Membership fees fund project infrastructure, staff support, security,
       and ecosystem development.

    ââ Decision-making in the Linux Foundation is decentralized and primarily happens at the
       project level. Technical influence follows a meritocratic model based on sustained,
       high-quality contribution, not contribution volume. While contributors who invest more
       time and resources naturally gain influence, all code is subject to peer review and
       community scrutiny. Low-quality or irrelevant contributions are rejected regardless of
       who submits them, and maintainers are selected based on demonstrated expertise,
       consistent high-quality contributions, and constructive participation in reviews and
       discussions.

Note on Commercial Open Source Software - insights from the State of Commercial Open
Source 2025 report

Commercial Open Source Software (COSS) can be defined as companies whose products or
services are built on publicly accessible source code - whether through OSI-approved licences,
open AI model weights, or software that combines meaningful open source components with
proprietary features. These companies operate commercially, often leveraging open source as a
foundation for scalable business models, reflecting the evolving approaches to monetization,
governance, and venture-backed growth in todayâs software landscape.

   ââ Commercial Open Source (COSS) is a well-established venture investment category,
      accounting for an average of $9B per year across ~250 deals.
   ââ Mega-rounds in 2024 reflect high confidence in late-stage COSS category leaders:
      Databricks: $9.5B, xAI: $11B, Mistral AI: $600M (Series A).
   ââ The US is still the primary hub for VC-backed COSS companies, with 65% of
      companies being US-based â double the US share in overall software (33%).
   ââ Open source forms the backbone of modern software infrastructure; About 90% of
      venture-funded COSS companies design and maintain critical software infrastructure.
   ââ Development tools and core infrastructure are over 5x more likely to be commercial
      open source (COSS), with open source being the default go-to-market for investors &
      founders.
   ââ COSS companies outperform closed-source peers in fundraising speed and valuations
      at early stages. COSS exits are real: 12% of venture-funded COSS companies have
      reached M&A or IPO. They also get superior exit valuations (7x higher at IPO and 14x
      higher at M&A).
   ââ Highly valuable COSS companies cultivate integral & vibrant project communities:
      OpenSSF Criticality Score, the number of distinct contributors, & commit frequency
      correlate strongly with COSS valuations.
   ââ Communities benefit from COSS funding: 27% increase in distinct contributors, 2+ new
      contributing organizations, and 52% increase in release frequency following funding
      rounds.
   ââ COSS projects see significant community growth after funding â 8Ã more dependent
      projects, 7Ã more package downloads, and a 60% jump in GitHub stars.
