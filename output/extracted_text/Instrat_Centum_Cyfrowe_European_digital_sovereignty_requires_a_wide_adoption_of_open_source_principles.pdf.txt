1. Introduction
In order for the European Unionâs effort to build a sovereign digital ecosystem to
succeed, the EUâs digital strategy has to be based on the principles of open source.
Thus, both Instrat and Centrum Cyfrowe share the view that expanding the current
Open Source Software Strategy (2020â2023) to cover more areas of the Commissionâs
activities (including those aimed at impacting the whole European economy, not just
the operations of the Commission itself) is essential to reduce dependence on
nonâEU vendors, increase transparency, and strengthen European values such as
privacy, collaboration, climate responsibility and competitiveness.

Recent political developments reinforce this need. The European Parliament
resolution of 22 January 2026 (2025/2007(INI)) defines technological sovereignty as the
ability to âbuild capacity, resilience and security by reducing dependencies, preventing
reliance on foreign actors and single service providers.â It highlights the concentration
of power in nonâEU companies as a barrier to innovation and democratic control.

                                                                                               1
In line with the Tallinn Declaration (6 October 2017) and the EUâs AI strategies, we
propose concrete actions that will make open source the default choice for public
procurement, research funding and digital services.

2. Open-source as a default
2.1 Benefits from wide adoption of open-source

   1.â Transparency & Trust â Open source code can be audited by government
       bodies, NGOs, academia and citizens, allowing all kinds of third parties to verify
       whether particular solutions respect the privacy safeguards and comply with
       European values and laws.
   2.â Interoperability â Proliferation of shared, openly licensed components and
       standards simplify data exchange between applications, fostering a common
       digital market with less lock-ins and gatekeeping.
   3.â Innovation â Thriving ecosystem of open source solutions lowers the entry
       barriers for new firms, encouraging innovative solutions.
   4.â Healthy competition â In the ecosystem with robust open source libraries,
       companies compete on quality and features rather than fend off the
       competition by locking in their users, which accelerates overall sector growth.

2.2 Recommendations

   1.â Make Open-Source a Default Requirement in Public Tenders and Funding
       Schemes â Require bidders and participants to (a) use openâsource solutions
       where feasible, (b) publish results as open-source, and (c) commit to releasing
       any improvements upstream.
   2.â Fund Core Technologies â Map the strategic sectors dominated by nonâEU
       actors (e.g., cloud, AI, social media, data analytics) and set up schemes to fund
       the development and deployment of openâsource, interoperable alternatives.

These measures will help the Commission turn openâsource adoption into a
measurable driver of digital sovereignty.

3. OpenâSource for Research, Culture & AI
3.1 Current Challenges

   ââ BlackâBox Dominance â Critical digital services rely on proprietary platforms
      owned by a few global tech giants, creating a sovereignty gap.
   ââ Language and Culture Bias â Commercial AI models treat European languages,
      including Polish, as âlowâresource,â leading to cultural inaccuracies.

                                                                                       2
   ââ Carbon Cost â Large closedâsource models consume disproportionate amounts
      of energy, conflicting with the European Green Deal.

3.2 Benefits of an OpenâSource Approach

   ââ Reproducibility & Education â Researchers can inspect, modify and share code,
      improving scientific rigor and training the next generation of engineers.
   ââ PublicâPrivate Collaboration â Shared infrastructure enables universities and
      SMEs to coâdevelop models on public data and superâcomputing resources.
   ââ Energy Efficiency â Smaller, specialised openâsource models deliver
      comparable performance in particular contexts at a fraction of the carbon
      cost.

3.3 Recommendations

   1.â Invest in Democratically Governed Public Infrastructure â Build and maintain
       openâsource platforms that serve the public interest rather than corporate
       profit.
   2.â Provide Legal Clarity for PublicâAI Training â Confirm that Article 3 of the
       CDSM Directive applies to publicly funded AI model training, reducing
       uncertainty for researchers. Europe should not only regulate AI but also enable
       it by maintaining a balance between research and rights holders.
   3.â Fund âSmall Language Modelsâ (SLMs) â Prioritise European made,
       energyâefficient, openâsource models tailored to national languages and
       sectorâspecific use cases (e.g., Polandâs Bielik and PLLuM - see attached report
       for details).
   4.â Create European Data Commons â Establish European highâquality, multilingual
       text corpora that are freely accessible to openâsource projects to reduce
       barriers for developing sovereign AI.
   5.â Support CommunityâPublic Synergies â Encourage collaborative development
       of models like SpeakLeash, where grassroots groups partner with academic
       computing centres. The EU should champion this âcommunity-publicâ synergy
       as a viable alternative to Big Tech dominance.
   6.â Mandate OpenâSource in Public Procurement of AI â Require that AI systems
       used by administrations expose their weights and source code, enabling
       independent audits and avoiding vendor lockâin.

4. Joint Conclusion
By embedding the openâsource principles in policies addressing the economy, public
administration, research, culture and AI, the EU can:

   ââ Reduce strategic dependencies on nonâEU providers.
   ââ Enhance transparency, accountability and citizen trust.

                                                                                     3
   ââ Strengthen collaboration and knowledge distribution between various European
      sectors
   ââ Foster a competitive, innovative digital market that respects European values
      and environmental goals.

We therefore urge the Commission to adopt the recommendations above and to
embed openâsource as a cornerstone of the forthcoming European OpenâSource
Strategy.
