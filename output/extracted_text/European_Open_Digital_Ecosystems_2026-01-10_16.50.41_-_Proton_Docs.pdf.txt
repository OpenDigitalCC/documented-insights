1. Strengthening the Local Economy & Job Creation

    Retaining Value within the EU: Currently, a significant portion of the economic value
    generated by digital infrastructure is siphoned off to non-EU technology giants (primarily in
    the US) in the form of licensing fees. By prioritising Open Source, we can shift this capital
    towards local development and maintenance services. This ensures that taxpayer money
    remains within the European economic cycle.
    Fostering SMEs and Start-ups: Open Source lowers market entry barriers for small and
    medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It allows European businesses to build upon existing,
    high-quality components without facing prohibitive licensing costs, thereby creating a fertile
    ground for local innovation.
    Creating High-Quality Jobs: By moving away from being mere "users" of foreign
    proprietary software to becoming "co-creators" of Open Source solutions, we generate
    high-skilled jobs for developers and engineers within the EU, rather than outsourcing this
    expertise.

2. Geopolitical Independence & Security (Technological Sovereignty)

    Resilience against External Pressure: As recent geopolitical events illustrate (e.g., the
    vulnerability of international institutions to political pressure from foreign administrations),
    reliance on proprietary software from third countries renders the EUâs critical infrastructure
    vulnerable. Open Source is the key to "Sovereignty through Control": it ensures that no
    external actor can deactivate services, withhold updates, or leverage software access as a
    political weapon.
    Supply Chain Security & Transparency: Proprietary software acts as a "black box." Only
    Open Source software is fully auditable. This transparency is essential for critical
    infrastructure to proactively identify security vulnerabilities or "backdoors," rather than
    relying on blind trust in non-EU vendors.
    Long-term Availability: Open Source serves as a "public good." If a proprietary vendor
    becomes insolvent or discontinues a product, public administration is left stranded. Open
    Source ensures continuity as the code can be maintained by the community or alternative
    European service providers.

3. Efficiency & Cost-Effectiveness in the Public Sector ("Public Money, Public Code")

    Synergies instead of Silos: When a public authority develops an Open Source solution, it
    can be shared with and reused by other Member States or municipalities ("Interoperable
    Europe"). This prevents the redundancy of developing the same solution 27 times across
    the Union.
    Avoiding Vendor Lock-in: The dominance of specific non-EU players creates high
    switching costs and "network effects" that trap public institutions. Open Source guarantees
    that data formats remain open and that service providers can be changed without losing
    access to the underlying software.
    Digital Commons: Promoting Open Source strengthens the "Digital Commons"âa shared
    digital infrastructure that is collectively maintained, much like public roads or water
    systems, forming the bedrock of digital public services.

4. Education & Digital Literacy
    Understanding Concepts vs. Product Training: When schools utilise proprietary
    software, they are essentially providing free marketing and product training for specific
    foreign corporations. Teaching Open Source (e.g., Linux, LibreOffice) educates students on
    the fundamental concepts of computer science rather than merely how to operate a
    specific commercial interface.
    Sustainable Competence: Students who grow up with open systems develop a "maker
    mindset" and a deeper understanding of technology. This creates the foundation for the
    next generation of IT professionals in Europe who are capable of driving innovation rather
    than simply consuming imported technology.
    Future Adoption: Children who learn to use open, flexible tools in school are highly likely
    to utilise these cost-effective and robust solutions as adults in the professional world,
    further strengthening the European ecosystem.

5. Driver of Innovation

    Foundation of Modern Technology: It is widely recognised that the vast majority of
    modern software infrastructure (including Cloud and AI) relies on Open Source. Supporting
    this is not niche politics, but essential industrial policy.
    Rapid Problem Solving: The collaborative nature of Open Source allows for faster bug
    fixing and feature development compared to closed, proprietary cycles ("Linus's Law").
