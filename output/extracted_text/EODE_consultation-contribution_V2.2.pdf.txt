Contribution provided for the âEuropean Open Digital
Ecosystemsâ Strategy of the European Union: Use of
Unique Identifiers and International Standards
Submitted by Global Media Registry (GMR) and the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation
(GLEIF) in response to a public consultation

We welcome the European Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy as an update and expansion of the
Commissionâs 2020â2023 Open Source Software Strategy, and we particularly welcome the broader
perspective beyond open source software towards a holistic understanding of Digital Public Infrastructure
(DPI) as a strategic asset for the Union. In line with the Call for Evidence, we also support the Strategyâs
emphasis on strengthening the EU open-source ecosystem across the full lifecycle â from development
and maintenance to deployment, governance, sustainability, and market integration â as a key
contribution to technological sovereignty, competitiveness, and cybersecurity.
On this occasion, we would like to highlight unique identification mechanisms, grounded in existing
international standards, as a core building block for robust, scalable, and interoperable digital ecosystems.
In DPI terms, identifiers are âreusableâ and âinteroperableâ foundational components that other services
can build on, helping to avoid siloed solutions and vendor lock-in, and enabling future adaptation without
costly reinvention.

1. Background and Rationale
1.1. Context
       At times of progressive geopolitical shifts, digital policy is becoming a defining issue for the future
       trajectory of the European Union and liberal, open democracy as its operating system.
       Against this background we see the forthcoming âEuropean Open Digital Ecosystemsâ Strategy as
       intertwined with Europeâs Democracy Shield and efforts aiming at enhancing the Unionâs
       sovereignty in the field of digital technology.
       Recent research and publications on Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)1 underline that effective
       digital ecosystems should be designed around guiding principles of interoperability, reusability,
       openness, and the ability to securely share data. It also stresses that the DPI approach requires legal
       and policy safeguards, privacy-enhancing technologies, and governance mechanisms for
       accountability, inclusion, and rights protection. These are not ânice to havesâ; they are the conditions
       for a trustworthy, citizen-centric ecosystem.
       From an open-source ecosystem perspective, a recurring barrier to adoption and sustainable
       maintenance is the lack of shared, standardised mechanisms for identifying and attributing actors,
       assets, and responsibilities across distributed supply chains. Without reliable attribution, open
       ecosystems face higher integrity and security risks (including impersonation, fraud, and unclear
       responsibility), which in turn can discourage public-sector procurement and private-sector
       deployment and can undermine long-term sustainability of open-source communities and
       foundations.

   Accordingly, our contribution focuses on interoperability, enabled through co- and self-regulatory
   governance frameworks grounded in international industry standards, and on the transparency and
   accountability mechanisms that these frameworks make possible.

1.2. Open Digital Ecosystems require Identification and Attribution
   Unambiguous attribution is a key pillar of consumer safety and it is in the best interest of anyone
   doing honest business. Not surprisingly, âKnow your Supplierâ (KYS) and âKnow your Customerâ
   (KYC) have become essential principles of securing supply chains in almost every industry. In turn,
   bad actors can capitalize on the absence of clear attribution by faking the identity of brands, vendors
   or buyers to deceive and to cheat â and to get away with it.
   Identification is equally important as a driver for accountability and governance of open digital
   ecosystems, for example to trace back ownership and provenance of content. Distributed and
   federated systems require seamless interfaces which, in turn, rely on an agreed, interoperable
   taxonomy of datasets including stable and globally recognisable identifiers.
   Seen through a DPI lens, identifiers function as shared building blocks of digital public
   infrastructure: once established, they can be reused across public and private services, allowing new
   solutions to build on common foundations rather than recreating proprietary identity and attribution
   layers from scratch in each project, platform, or open-source stack. This reduces fragmentation,
   improves cross-border interoperability, and strengthens the Unionâs capacity to shape its digital
   foundations.

1.3. Leveraging existing international standards reduces
     fragmentation and costs
   The European Union encourages reliance on open standards and international standardisation
   efforts, including through its broader digital policy agenda and standardisation strategy. We
   therefore recommend explicitly recognising and encouraging the use of established identifier
   frameworks that are already widely recognised across sectors, including in regulated environments
   and self-regulatory contexts:
   â  Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)
     The LEI provides a globally standardised, ISO-recognised identifier for legal entities.
     Referencing LEIs in governance and provenance metadata can support trustworthy attribution of
     responsibility for digital services and ecosystem participants, particularly for compliance,
     accountability, and cross-border verification.
      In addition, the verifiable LEI (vLEI), the digital counterpart of the LEI, enables
      cryptographically verifiable, tamper-evident proof of an entityâs identity and role, supporting
      automated trust decisions in digital workflows. As such, vLEI can strengthen authentication and
      accountability in open digital ecosystems, including for signing and validating provenance
      assertions at scale.
      Figure 1 illustrates how the concept of Digital Public Infrastructure aligns with the Global LEI
      System. The Legal Entity Identifier enables seamless cross-sector and cross-border
      interoperability in entity identification, serving as a foundational building block for trusted digital
      ecosystems.
      All LEI data is open, freely available, and accessible without any registration. This ensures that
      regulators, businesses, researchers, and other stakeholders can use the data on equal terms,
      supporting transparency and broad accessibility.

                                                                                  V2.2 â February 2026 | page 2
   The Global LEI System is managed by a not-for-profit foundation operating under public
   oversight. This governance structure ensures that the system functions in the public interest and is
   not driven by commercial objectives. The LEI is adopted in more than 200 jurisdictions and is
   used by both public and private actors worldwide, demonstrating its global reach and
   inclusiveness.
   Oversight of the system is provided by the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC), which
   ensures accountability, transparency, and alignment with the public good. The ROC includes
   representatives from more than 50 countries globally, with participation from several European
   institutions, including the European Commission, the European Securities and Markets
   Authority, the European Banking Authority, and the European Central Bank.
   The Digital Public Infrastructure concept is fully aligned with the European Unionâs work on
   European Digital Identity and European Data Spaces. These initiatives reflect the same core
   principles, including openness, interoperability, governance under public oversight, and cross-
   border operability, further reinforcing the relevance of the Global LEI System within the evolving
   European and global digital policy landscape.

   Figure 1: The Global LEI System as a DPI

â  Global Media Identifier (GMI)
  The GMI standard offers an ISO-backed, media-native and interoperable identifier designed to
  persist across transformations and distribution channels. In the context of open digital
  ecosystems, it enables consistent identification of media assetsâ sources independently of format or
  platform, supporting resilient provenance chains and interoperability across tools and services.
â  Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)
  C2PA operationalises content provenance as a reusable, interoperable DPI building block by
  standardising cryptographically signed manifests that can be implemented consistently across
  tools, platforms, and services. This enables trusted recording of creation and editing steps along
  the value chain and supports scalable verification. C2PA also provides a practical framework to
  integrate unique identifiers (e.g., LEI and GMI) into signed manifests and verification
  workflows, strengthening attribution and cross-border interoperability.

                                                                            V2.2 â February 2026 | page 3
   Other relevant, existing industry standards in this field include the Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
   ecosystem, the International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI), and the International Standard
   Content Code (ISCC), all backed by a respective ISO norm.

1.4. Industry Standards as a Self-regulatory Instrument
   Commonly shared industry standards are a well-established instrument for compliance and risk
   mitigation. Their development and implementation are driven by demand and consensus, governed
   by bodies such as ISO or its European subset CEN-CENELEC, and intended for broad, non-
   proprietary implementation.
   â  Interoperability and Openness
      Harmonised terminology and taxonomy are prerequisites for enforceable policyâbe it voluntary
      corporate action, sectoral self-regulation, or statutory regulation. The existing portfolio of LEI,
      GMI and C2PA provides examples of non-proprietary, interoperable records with adjacent,
      unified metadata sets.
   â  Accountability and Transparency
      Structured data availability and access are prerequisites for meaningful accountability mechanisms
      (regulatory reporting, internal compliance, independent research). DPI experience highlights that
      strong safeguards (legal and policy, privacy-enhancing technology, and governance for
      accountability and inclusion) must be designed in from the outset to prevent new concentrations
      or abuses of power in digital ecosystems.
   â  Efficiency and Security
      Common data standards reduce duplication, lower compliance costs, and strengthen security.
      While robust identity protocols are commonplace in financial transactions, they remain largely
      absent in the online news and information space. Strengthening attribution and provenance
      across the digital ecosystem is an essential upgrade for the integrity, resilience, and security of
      Europeâs information space.
   In this regard, industry standards enable open-source solutions to deliver added value for both public
   and private sectors by supporting lower switching costs and reduced lock-in; improved transparency
   and auditability of components; stronger supply-chain security practices; faster innovation and reuse;
   and better interoperability across vendors and borders â all of which are critical factors for assessing
   value in procurement and deployment decisions.

                                                                                 V2.2 â February 2026 | page 4
2. Response to the Consultation
  We would like to provide comments to the following questions raised in the Consultation:

  1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are the main barriers that
     hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source; and (ii) sustainable
     contributions to open-source communities?
     A recurring perception is that open-source software and, in this context, open data are of lower
     quality compared to proprietary solutions. In practice, this perception is often unfounded. Many
     open-source communities apply very rigorous review, validation, and governance processes. Since
     the source code or data are openly accessible, they can be inspected, tested, and scrutinised by a
     broad range of stakeholders, which is fundamentally different from proprietary solutions where
     such transparency is not possible. This openness should be recognised as a core strength of the
     open-source model.
     Nevertheless, one of the still addressable weaknesses of the current open-source and open data
     ecosystem is the persistence of silos. In many cases, datasets or software components are made
     openly available but remain standalone and insufficiently connected to other resources. The value
     of open data and open-source solutions would increase significantly if they were better
     interconnected and interoperable. This can be supported by relying on and integrating globally
     recognised standards that act as linchpins across ecosystems, such as the Legal Entity Identifier
     (LEI) and the Global Markets Identifier (GMI). Such standards facilitate reuse, integration, and
     sustainable contributions by both organisations and individuals.

  2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please provide concrete
     examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation, among others) that are
     most important to assess the added value.
     The primary added value of open-source solutions lies in their transparency. While a certain level
     of technical expertise is required to analyse source code or data, this transparency enables public
     and private sector users to assess risks, security properties, and compliance in a clear and thorough
     manner. This level of scrutiny is often not possible with proprietary solutions, where users must
     rely on vendor assurances.
     Open-source communities also tend to react more quickly to technological developments and
     emerging innovations. Their collaborative nature allows for rapid iteration, experimentation, and
     the integration of new technologies, which supports innovation and adaptability. Furthermore,
     open-source solutions reduce the risk of vendor lock-in and increase strategic autonomy, which is
     particularly relevant for public administrations and critical infrastructures.
     Finally, the absence of licence fees or the availability of open data at low or no cost remains an
     important benefit. While implementation and maintenance costs still exist, open-source solutions
     can significantly lower barriers to entry, foster competition, and support broader adoption across
     sectors.

  3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the development and growth of
     the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?
     Please refer to Section 3 below regarding the measures and actions recommended at EU level to
     support the development and growth of the EU open-source sector.

                                                                                      V2.2 â February 2026 | page 5
        4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
           In terms of priority technology areas, we would highlight open and interoperable components for
           digital identity and attribution, content provenance, secure data sharing, and software supply-
           chain transparency â as cross-cutting enablers for information integrity application across cloud,
           AI, advertising tech and cybersecurity. In this regard we also refer to our contribution to the
           public consultation regarding the European Democracy Shield (F3555124).

        5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
           Beyond the information space, stronger open-source adoption combined with standards-based
           identification can increase competitiveness and cyber resilience in critical sectors explicitly
           highlighted in the Call for Evidence â including cloud, AI, cybersecurity, IoT/edge, and
           industrial domains such as automotive and manufacturing â where complex multi-actor supply
           chains and cross-border interoperability are the norm.

3. Recommendations
        Accordingly, we recommend that the Strategy should:

          ï§ Explicitly acknowledge unique, globally standardized identifiers as a prerequisite for
            open and interoperable digital ecosystems;
          ï§ Treat such identifier infrastructures as reusable DPI building blocks that reduce
            fragmentation and vendor lock-in, and enable future adaptation without costly
            reinvention;
          ï§ Encourage the uptake and integration of existing international standards (including
            LEI, GMI and C2PA) and support further standardization where gaps remain;
          ï§ Support open-source reference implementations and reusable building blocks for
            identifier-based attribution and provenance (e.g., libraries, APIs, validation tools), to
            lower integration costs and accelerate adoption by SMEs, public administrations, and
            open-source communities;
          ï§ Provide targeted support for non-profit actors and networks â such as the Global
            Open Data Integration Network (GODIN)2 â in this space, including dedicated
            regulatory and R&D sandboxes and sustainable funding to ensure long-term
            maintenance, security updates, and resilience;
          ï§ Encourage alignment with the European Commissionâs Standardization Strategy and
             DPI guiding principles (interoperability, reusability, openness, secure data sharing).

        This approach would strengthen interoperability, reduce compliance costs (especially for SMEs and
        SMCs), and reinforce trust in open digital ecosystems across the EU and globally â while remaining
        consistent with existing legal frameworks and the Unionâs objectives on sovereignty, resilience and
        democratic integrity.

4. Conclusion
    The European Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy presents an opportunity to strengthen
    interoperability, trust, and sustainability by building on existing, standards-based identifier
    infrastructures. Recognising these as reusable DPI components can help reduce fragmentation,
    support open-source adoption, and advance the Unionâs broader goals on sovereignty, security, and
    resilience. We stand ready to contribute expertise and engage with the Commission and relevant
    stakeholders in support of the Strategyâs implementation.
