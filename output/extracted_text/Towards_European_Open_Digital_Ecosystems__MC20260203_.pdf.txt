Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems
Call for Evidence/Public Consultation
Contribution by Michele Capobianco (03-02-2026)1

Executive Summary: Strategic Importance and Relevance
An EU Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy is strategically important because it directly links digital
infrastructure choices to technological sovereignty, competitiveness and security, in a context where
70â90% of code depends on open source and most value currently leaks outside the Union. The
strategy is even more critical in a future where IoTâEdgeâCloud continua, 6G networks, AI-native
systems, autonomous platforms, quantum computing and zero-trust security all converge on shared,
and increasingly complex, programmable infrastructures.
The Call for Evidence is timely and extremely relevant at present for several reasons:
      ï·    Strategic timing - It is one of the few instruments where individual developers, SMEs, research
           bodies and public administrations can influence to some extent a non-legislative strategy that
           will guide funding, public-private partnerships and the framing of "sovereign" open
           technologies alongside the forthcoming Cloud and AI Development Act.
      ï·    Comprehensive scope - The initiative explicitly addresses the full open-source lifecycle - from
           development through maintenance, sustainability and market integration - across critical
           sectors including AI, cloud, edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, internet
           technologies, and industrial applications such as automotive and manufacturing.
      ï·    Future-oriented approach - The strategy recognizes emerging paradigms including the
           computing continuum (IoT-Edge-Cloud/Multi-Cloud), edge intelligence, autonomous systems,
           AI-native 6G networks, quantum-safe cryptography, zero-trust architectures, and threat-
           intelligence-driven network management. These trends make the strategy not just relevant
           but essential for Europe's technological future.
      ï·    Sovereignty and resilience - In an era where essential digital capabilities - from cybersecurity
           and IoT platforms to cloud services, AI frameworks, network infrastructure and data systems -
           determine economic prosperity and security, the strategy aims to ensure these capabilities are
           grounded in trustable, open, interoperable and verifiable foundations rather than depending
           on external actors or non-transparent technologies.

The following paragraphs answer the questions of the Call for Evidence. The proposed answers directly
address the initiative's key objectives by discussing the added value of open source across public and
private sectors, proposing concrete measures for deployment infrastructure, software supply chain
security and project sustainability through stable lifecycle funding and EU-centered governance
frameworks, outlining viable business models and public-private partnership mechanisms, identifying
best practices and procurement reforms to encourage contribution and adoption, and prioritizing
technology areas and sectors where open source can achieve successful market integration alongside
legacy systems through interoperable reference architectures and policy alignment.

Answers to the Proposed Questions

1. Strengths, Weaknesses and Barriers of the EU Open-Source Sector
The EU open-source ecosystem presents a complex picture of significant assets undermined by
structural challenges. On the strength side, Europe boasts some of the world's most active developer
communities whose work naturally aligns with EU digital rights and principles. This cultural alignment
provides fertile ground for sovereign digital solutions. The track record of EU-funded programmes
demonstrates real capability: initiatives like the Next Generation Internet, FIWARE framework,
GenAI4EU, and RISC-V investments have successfully created high-quality code and vibrant
ecosystems. Europe's research base in emerging areas - particularly cloud-edge-IoT continuum and 6G
technologies - is robust, with strong institutional frameworks through IPCEI-CIS and the 6G Industry
Association. Growing public-sector momentum, exemplified by the European Digital Infrastructure
Consortium for Digital Commons, shows that coordinated EU approaches can build genuine
alternatives to proprietary solutions.
However, these strengths are severely compromised by structural weaknesses. The most damaging is
value capture: much of the economic value generated by EU open-source projects is exploited outside
Europe, typically by non-EU tech giants. European stakeholders face fragmented business models with
unclear pathways from research prototypes to commercial viability, struggling against high entry
barriers and network effects of dominant players in both public procurement and private markets.
Limited access to growth capital, hosting infrastructure, and support services further constrains
development. Adoption patterns vary wildly across sectors, with many industries still uncertain about
open source's business value and risk profile. Perhaps most concerning, Europe's dependence on non-
EU platforms becomes systemically dangerous as 6G networks, edge computing, autonomous systems
and AI workloads converge on a small number of proprietary stacks, creating vulnerabilities that
threaten European autonomy.
The barriers to adoption and maintenance are multifaceted and reinforcing. Vendor lock-in and
network effects create powerful disincentives to switch from established proprietary solutions. The
technical complexity of orchestrating distributed applications across IoT, edge and cloud with strict
latency and safety requirements makes operators risk-averse, often preferring vertically integrated
solutions despite their transparency and sovereignty costs. Without standardized reference
architectures, each deployment becomes a bespoke integration project, discouraging community-
developed components and inflating costs. Procurement frameworks often inadvertently favor large
proprietary vendors, while legal uncertainty and liability concerns further discourage public-sector
adoption. For advanced use cases like edge intelligence and autonomous systems, the lack of
established certification processes for open-source components creates additional hurdles. The
transition to quantum-safe cryptography and zero-trust architectures requires deep protocol changes
that, without coordinated EU support, may push organizations toward proprietary solutions.
Barriers to sustainable community contributions are equally challenging. EU research programmes
support initial development but rarely finance the long-term maintenance, governance,
documentation and community management essential for successful scaling. Organizational incentives
are misaligned: internal KPIs, legal uncertainty and liability concerns prevent companies and public
bodies from allowing staff to contribute upstream during working time. The computing continuum
requires rare multi-disciplinary expertise spanning networking, 6G, AI, security, hardware and cloud-
native development - profiles heavily recruited by global platforms, making talent retention difficult
for EU projects and SMEs. Fragmented foundation infrastructure means there's no cohesive EU-
centered framework to host projects, pool resources and provide legal and compliance support across
Member States. Finally, advanced stacks require substantial resources for operational aspects -
observability, security hardening, documentation, governance - that remain weakly funded in EU
programmes.

2. Added Value of Open Source for the Public and Private Sectors
Open source delivers strategic value across multiple dimensions that extend far beyond simple cost
savings. The initiative correctly frames it as a public good that reduces dependencies, increases
infrastructure control, and improves transparency and resilience - particularly critical in a future
characterized by converging IoT-Edge-Cloud continua, 6G networks, AI-native systems and quantum
threats.
From a cost and total cost of ownership perspective, public administrations can pool investments in
shared components - identity management, data exchange middleware, collaboration tools, document
management and workflow engines - rather than paying repeated license fees. In the computing
continuum context, administrations and operators can share EU-developed open stacks for device,
edge and cloud orchestration, reducing duplicated investments while enabling rapid deployment of
new use cases from smart ports and cities to connected vehicles and e-health. For private sector actors,
particularly SMEs, building on existing open-source stacks reduces upfront R&D costs, allowing
resources to focus on differentiation and domain-specific features. Start-ups can build edge-
intelligence and autonomous-system solutions on top of open AI frameworks and 6G control-plane
components rather than reinventing generic infrastructure.
The sovereignty and risk reduction benefits are equally compelling. Open designs and code bases
enable verification of security properties, avoidance of opaque data-extraction practices, and
elimination of single-vendor lock-in - all central to EU technological sovereignty. For critical
infrastructure including networks, edge computing and data spaces, open components allow Member
States and agencies to audit, fork and maintain systems even if vendors exit the market. Multi-provider
6G and continuum deployments become feasible, reducing dependence on individual vendors and
allowing infrastructure to be moved across clouds and operators for sovereignty and resilience
reasons. For autonomous systems sharing computing continua, open source enables transparent
inspection of decision logic, safety mechanisms and update pipelines - vital for liability assessment and
cross-border deployment.
Security benefits manifest through auditability and enhanced vulnerability management. Open source
supports coordinated disclosure and independent security assessments along software supply chains,
with shared maintenance reducing the probability that critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched in
widely reused components. Zero-trust architectures - requiring pervasive identity management,
continuous authentication, fine-grained policy enforcement and deep telemetry - benefit from open
implementations that make control planes auditable and composable. Threat-intelligence pipelines
benefit from open formats and tools that enable cross-border collaboration and independent
verification, supporting more resilient collective cyber defense. For quantum threats, open
implementations of post-quantum algorithms allow transparent validation and faster migration in
critical networks, while early integration into network and edge stacks avoids incompatible proprietary
solutions and ensures long-term confidentiality.
Innovation and standardization accelerate through open ecosystems. NGI projects, GenAI4EU open
models and open vehicle stacks accelerate experimentation, reuse and interoperability, feeding faster
standardization and reducing duplication across EU projects and Member States. Innovators, start-ups
and SMEs can rapidly prototype and scale offerings in AI, cloud, IoT and cybersecurity, strengthening
EU competitiveness relative to global incumbents. Concrete examples span from NGI open internet
technologies providing shared building blocks for secure services, to FIWARE enabling commercial
solutions for mobility and logistics, to open AI models providing transparent alternatives for public
governance, to RISC-V reducing IP licensing constraints for European chip value chains, to the Digital
Commons EDIC creating stable platforms for companies to offer specialized vertical solutions.

3.   Concrete EU-Level Measures and Actions
A coherent EU strategy must combine stable funding, reference architectures, dedicated programmes,
governance frameworks, procurement reform and skills development to address the full open-source
lifecycle across emerging technology paradigms.
Stable funding and lifecycle support forms the foundation. Multi-year funding lines or mission-oriented
programmes should cover the complete lifecycle: core development, security hardening and auditing,
documentation and user experience design, community management and governance, and long-term
maintenance. Critical project programmes should support key libraries, frameworks and tools widely
reused in EU infrastructure, similar to existing cybersecurity or digital commons initiatives but focused
explicitly on software supply-chain robustness.
Open reference stacks for continuum and 6G are essential. The EU should fund and mandate modular
reference architectures spanning device, edge, transport/6G network and cloud layers, including
standard APIs and data models, orchestration and lifecycle management interfaces, observability and
monitoring frameworks, and policy and security control planes. EU-funded telecommunications and
edge computing projects should be required to provide open-source implementations of key control-
plane components as part of these reference stacks, building on initiatives like IPCEI-CIS and AIOTI
frameworks.
Dedicated programmes for edge intelligence and autonomous systems should launch funding for open
edge-AI frameworks, toolchains and runtime environments supporting safety-critical and real-time
applications including connected vehicles, industrial control, aviation systems and maritime
automation, with explicit links between open-source development and certification requirements.
Shared open testbeds where autonomous-system behaviours can be validated on realistic 5G/6G-
integrated cloud-edge infrastructures should make results, datasets and validated code available as
digital commons.
Zero-trust and threat intelligence integration requires funding for open-source zero-trust frameworks
designed for heterogeneous IoT-Edge-Cloud environments and multi-provider 6G networks, covering
identity and access management, continuous authentication and authorization, fine-grained policy
enforcement, micro-segmentation and continuous verification. Open threat-intelligence platforms
and standardized formats for sharing telemetry, indicators of compromise, tactics and techniques
should integrate with Security Operations Centers and network management tools, with specific focus
on AI-based detection, 6G network slicing and edge computing environments.
Quantum-ready open infrastructures demand investment in open-source implementations of post-
quantum cryptographic libraries, quantum-safe protocols and key-management systems, with shared
EU testing infrastructures to validate these at scale in telecommunications, edge and cloud stacks. All
EU-funded networking and cloud-edge projects should be required to include quantum-safe transition
roadmaps and open reference implementations to avoid last-minute proprietary lock-in.
EU-centered foundation and governance infrastructure should support a network of EU-anchored
open-source foundations and cooperatives that can host and govern critical projects, manage
intellectual property and licensing, provide legal and compliance services, and orchestrate cross-
border governance structures. Open governance models should become eligibility criteria in EU
funding programmes, with domain-specific foundations for networking, edge computing and AI stacks
offering governance and legal services for rapidly evolving critical projects.
Procurement, policy and regulatory alignment must adapt public procurement frameworks to explicitly
recognize open source and digital commons as valid options, with evaluation criteria rewarding
openness, interoperability, avoidance of vendor lock-in, quantum-safe and zero-trust readiness, and
supply-chain security. Model contracts and templates should combine open-source software with
commercial support services, lowering legal uncertainty. Relevant EU regulations should align with
open-source practices, ensuring compliance requirements are implementable by community projects
and SMEs, not only large proprietary vendors.

                                                                           Call for Evidence/Public Consultation

Incentives for organizational contributions should include recognizing and encouraging "contribution
time" in EU-funded projects, mandating or rewarding upstream contributions to existing open
components. Best-practice frameworks should guide corporate and public-sector contribution policies,
addressing risk management, intellectual property handling, staffing models and legal review
processes. Infrastructure and tooling support should co-fund EU-based hosting and collaboration
platforms respecting EU standards - code repositories, issue trackers, CI/CD (Continuous
Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines, documentation platforms - operated as part of Digital
Commons infrastructures. Shared security tooling for SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, secure
build systems and supply-chain integrity verification should be provided free or at low cost to EU open-
source projects and SMEs.
Skills, education and ecosystem building should embed open-source development, governance and
licensing in digital skills programmes, higher education curricula and vocational training. Cross-sector
communities of practice should share reference architectures, case studies, deployment experiences,
reusable stacks and governance best practices across public-sector IT leaders, regulated industries,
SMEs and research institutions.

4. Priority Technology Areas
Prioritization should reflect both sovereignty impact, existing EU strengths, and overall tendencies,
spanning the technology stack from hardware through networking to applications and services, with
particular attention to emerging paradigms.
Multi-provider IoT-Edge-Cloud continuum platforms form the foundational layer. Orchestration,
serverless frameworks and data-processing middleware that natively span devices, edge nodes and
clouds underpin all advanced applications and must include built-in observability, identity and access
management, policy enforcement and security telemetry. Edge intelligence and AI-native network
automation represent the next critical layer: reusable AI components for self-optimizing 6G networks
with automated configuration and resource allocation, alongside network features tailored to
distributed AI workloads, with open toolchains for model training, deployment, monitoring,
explainability and safety certification.
Cloud and edge infrastructures provide essential foundations for all higher-level services, with open
implementations reducing dependence on non-EU hyperscalers and enabling sovereign hosting for
sensitive data and critical workloads across IaaS platforms, container orchestration, serverless
computing, edge runtime environments, and storage systems. Open 6G network functions and
management - including cloud-native implementations of control plane, user plane, network slicing,
RAN (Radio Access Network) components, MANO (Management and Orchestration) frameworks and
service mesh layers - support multi-provider and sovereign deployment models building on European
6G vision and SNS JU research.
Artificial intelligence frameworks and models provide transparent, auditable alternatives aligned with
EU values, spanning large language models, domain-specific models, training and inference
frameworks, model governance, lifecycle management and explainability tools. Autonomous systems
software stacks for connected and cooperative systems require shared open components for
perception, sensor fusion, localization, decision-making, safety envelopes, V2X communication and
fleet management across vehicles, drones, maritime vessels, industrial robots and logistics systems.
Cybersecurity tools and zero-trust platforms enable independent verification and faster collective
response, including zero-trust identity and access management, continuous authentication and policy
enforcement, micro-segmentation, threat intelligence platforms, and SOAR and SIEM systems.
Quantum-safe networking and cryptographic services provide open building blocks for post-quantum
security integrated into 6G and edge platforms: post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, quantum-
safe key management, hybrid protocols, secure communication protocols and quantum random
number generators.

                                                                           Call for Evidence/Public Consultation

Internet technologies and data-space middleware ensure interoperability across Member States and
sectors through data space connectors, identity and authentication services, data catalogues, semantic
interoperability, consent and policy management, and secure data sharing and federation. IoT and
industrial platforms raise interoperability across factories, ports and supply chains through industrial
IoT platforms, edge frameworks for operational technology, digital twin frameworks, time-sensitive
networking stacks and industrial automation protocols.
Open hardware anchors value chains in Europe, particularly RISC-V processor architectures for edge
and embedded systems, open hardware designs for high-performance computing, edge computing
hardware platforms, and sensor and actuator reference designs. Digital commons for public services
enable reuse and reduce fragmentation through shared platforms for document management,
collaboration, case management, workflow, identity, authentication, cross-border interoperability
frameworks and citizen engagement.

5. Sectors Where Open Source Increases Competitiveness and Cyber Resilience
Structured use of open source can simultaneously enhance competitiveness and cyber resilience
across sectors, particularly when combined with EU-level coordination and strategic technology
priorities.
Public administration and digital government benefit from shared open platforms for identity
management, data exchange, document management and case handling that lower operational costs
through shared investment, enable cross-border interoperability, reduce dependence on proprietary
cloud office suites, and allow deeper security scrutiny. More efficient services with lower IT spending
free resources for service improvement and innovation, while auditable code and control over
infrastructure reduce vulnerability to supply-chain attacks and enable sovereign incident response.
Transport, mobility and logistics will depend heavily on edge intelligence, 6G connectivity and shared
computing continua for connected and autonomous vehicles, ships, drones and logistics systems. Open
stacks reduce platform dependence, enable local innovation ecosystems and support auditable safety
and security for critical operations spanning software-defined vehicles, intelligent transportation
systems, smart ports, fleet management and charging infrastructure. European automotive, maritime
and logistics companies can differentiate through interoperable solutions rather than being locked into
proprietary platforms, while transparent code for safety-critical functions enables independent
security validation.
Manufacturing, industrial IoT and process industries rely on dense IoT deployments, edge AI and 6G
connectivity for automation, quality control and predictive maintenance. Open industrial platforms
and zero-trust/quantum-safe solutions increase interoperability across multi-vendor equipment,
lower integration costs, strengthen resilience against both conventional and quantum-enabled cyber
attacks, and enable real-time security monitoring. This lowers barriers to advanced capabilities for
European SMEs and mid-sized manufacturers while enabling defense-in-depth strategies for critical
production systems.
Energy and critical infrastructure require open, quantum-safe and zero-trust-ready control systems,
real-time telemetry and analytics, distributed monitoring and coordinated incident response for smart
grids, renewable energy management, pipeline monitoring and infrastructure control. European
energy companies and infrastructure operators maintain technological leadership while ensuring long-
term sovereignty over critical control systems, with survivability in the face of advanced cyber threats
including future quantum-enabled attacks.
Healthcare and public health services increasingly rely on edge computing and 6G networks for
sensitive health data and latency-critical applications. Open infrastructures ensure transparency and
verifiability of data handling, local control over sensitive patient data, interoperability across
healthcare providers and Member States, and auditability for regulatory compliance. European health-
tech companies can build on sovereign, trusted platforms meeting strict data-protection

requirements, while open zero-trust architectures reduce vulnerability to ransomware and data
breaches.
Telecommunications and cloud service providers can differentiate by offering open, sovereign cloud-
edge-6G platforms with built-in zero-trust security, threat intelligence integration, quantum-safe
cryptography, multi-tenant isolation and transparent data governance. This enables European
providers to compete on transparency, compliance and integration capabilities rather than pure scale,
while open network functions and security controls enable rapid response to emerging threats and
coordinated defense.
Financial services and digital payments require high security, auditability and regulatory compliance.
Open-source components for identity and authentication, transaction processing, threat intelligence,
anomaly detection and quantum-safe encryption enable European financial institutions to reduce
dependence on proprietary core banking and payment platforms while providing stronger long-term
protection against sophisticated attacks on high-value targets.
Defense and dual-use applications increasingly recognize the value of open, auditable components for
command, control and communications systems, cybersecurity tools, situational awareness,
autonomous systems and secure communications. The European defense industry maintains
technological independence and avoids strategic dependence on foreign suppliers for critical systems,
with auditable code and sovereign control reducing vulnerability to supply-chain compromises.
Research and education benefit from open platforms for data analysis and simulation, collaborative
research tools, open access to AI models and training data, and transparent, reproducible
computational methods that accelerate scientific discovery by reducing barriers to advanced
computational tools. Open security tools and practices in research networks serve as training grounds
for the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.
Agriculture and environmental monitoring increasingly rely on IoT sensor networks, edge computing
for real-time analysis, satellite and drone data processing, and predictive models for precision
agriculture and climate research. European agricultural technology companies can build on open
platforms enabling innovations accessible to farmers across all scales of operation, while secure,
transparent IoT and edge platforms protect critical food production infrastructure.

Conclusion and Summary of Key Responses
The European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy represents a critical opportunity to transform open
source from a hidden dependency into a deliberate instrument of industrial policy, cybersecurity
and technological sovereignty.
In a future characterized by converging IoTâEdgeâCloud continua, AI-native 6G networks, Intelligent
Internet of Intelligent Things, autonomous systems, quantum computing threats, pervasive zero-trust
requirements, etc. the strategy must go beyond supporting isolated open-source projects. It requires
building a comprehensive European ecosystem spanning:
    ï·   Technology - Open reference stacks for continuum, 6G, edge intelligence, autonomous
        systems, quantum-safe cryptography and zero-trust security.
    ï·   Governance - EU-centered foundations and transparent governance frameworks.
    ï·   Business models - Sustainable pathways from research to industrial deployment and
        commercial viability.
    ï·   Skills - Education and training for multi-disciplinary open-source development.
    ï·   Policy - Procurement, regulatory and funding frameworks that systematically favour open,
        sovereign solutions.

The measures proposed in this response - stable lifecycle funding, open reference architectures,
domain-specific foundations, adapted procurement, shared infrastructure, quantum-safe roadmaps

and zero-trust integration - provide a concrete pathway to realize this vision. Success will be
measured not just by the volume of open-source code produced in Europe, but by:
    ï·    The proportion of critical digital infrastructure running on trustable, auditable, European-
         anchored open platforms.
    ï·    The number of viable European companies and foundations providing open-source-based
         solutions.
    ï·    The degree of technological sovereignty in sectors from telecommunications and cloud to
         automotive, manufacturing and public services.
    ï·    The resilience of European digital systems to supply-chain attacks, vendor failures and
         emerging quantum threats.

This Call for Evidence provides a unique opportunity for stakeholders across the European open-source
ecosystem - developers, companies, foundations, public administrations, research institutions and civil
society - to shape a strategy that will define Europe's digital future for decades to come.
