Feedback from the Free Silicon Foundation
The following feedback focuses on open-source silicon and its ecosystem. "Open silicon" denotes
an integrated circuit whose complete design (from the abstract description to the layout) is publicly
available and can be implemented using open-source EDA tools, enabling full auditability and
technological sovereignty.

The text is largely based on the following documents:

White paper for the EC, January 2020

Question 1: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Barriers
Strengths: Europe has excellent chip design education and historically contributed core Electronic
Design Automation (EDA) algorithms. Pioneering open-source EDA companies exist (YosysHQ,
ChipFlow), and IHP Microelectronics released Germany's first open PDK, a replicable model.
Weaknesses: The know-how for developing (not for using) EDA tools has nearly disappeared from
EU universities. Academia lacks incentives for open-source contributions -publications count, open-
source projects don't. Most professors are users, not developers, of proprietary EDA tools, creating
cultural bias against open-source.
Barriers to adoption: Mainstream EDA vendors prohibit publishing any outputs from their tools,
killing open hardware at its root. Students face NDA burdens (e.g. restricted access or inability to
study the EDA code) before lectures, discouraging careers in chip design. Mainstream tools are
unfriendly and expensive.
Barriers to sustainability: EU dependence on foreign EDA tools creates existential extraterritorial
risk, as demonstrated when Cadence shut Moscow offices overnight. Permissive licenses allow
publicly-funded innovations to be absorbed by proprietary vendors effectively undermining the
economic sustainability of the open-source ecosystem. Patent threats loom over open-source EDA
and hardware developers.

Question 2: Added Value
Cost: Open-source EDA tools eliminate license fees exceeding â¬1M/year per company.
OpenROAD development cost ~$3M/year total -less than three commercial licenses.
Lock-in: Open-source silicon enables foundry portability. Foundry PDKs written in proprietary
formats lock entire ecosystems to foreign EDA vendors.
Security: Open silicon (open all the way to layout) enables public verification that fabricated chips
match published layouts (genuine auditability). See the ROCA vulnerability in Estonian ID cards
for an example of the problem.
Innovation: Open-source enables massive design synthesis parallelization impossible with costly
proprietary licenses. OpenROAD achieved 24-hour RTL-to-layout synthesis and 12nm-node
capability by 2023. Community-developed PDKs can arguably contain fewer errors through public
scrutiny.
Concrete examples: Prof. Pretl (JKU Linz) runs complete open-source chip design courses.
TinyTapeout democratizes silicon access commercially. IHP's open PDK enabled the first fully-
open European chip designs.

Question 3: Concrete EU-Level Measures
Academia:
    â¢ Fund new and independent (not bound to proprietary EDA vendors) professorships
      specifically for open-source EDA tool development
    â¢ Reform evaluation metrics to recognize open-source contributions alongside publications
    â¢ Create ERC-style calls for independent researchers to shift academic culture towards open-
      source
Licensing: Mandate copyleft (GPL-style, forever-open) licenses for all publicly-funded (except
reasoned exceptions) design tools and silicon designs since permissive licenses allow public
investments to be captured by proprietary vendors.
PDK development: Launch calls for open PDK development at sub-90nm nodes, replicating IHP's
model across Member States.
Legislation: Recognize open-silicon as key to hardware cybersecurity in CRA implementation.
Introduce patent fair-play legislation/clauses for protecting the open-source ecosystem from patent
threats.
Tax incentives: As an example, enable tax-free support for "ethical" companies using copyleft
licenses.
Legal frameworks: We believe in the importance of growing a business ecosystem which uses,
develops and supports open-source. However, killer acquisitions pose a risk for the community. The
concept of steward ownership â as proposed in the "28th Regime - A legal framework for
innovation the European way" - could offer a convenient and robust way to build enterprises which
cannot easily be killed by acquisition and hence build a reliable pillar for a sustainable open-source
ecosystem.

Question 4: Technology Priorities
Highest priority: Open-source EDA tools. Without them, open silicon is impossible since
proprietary vendors prohibit publishing any design outputs. Open-source tools should achieve at
least comparable, if not superior, quality than commercial counterparts, at least on older
technologies (to be scaled towards more modern nodes with time).
For hardware, immediate-term:
    â¢ Open-silicon Root-of-Trust for HSMs, smartcards, SoCs -formally verifiable, publicly
      auditable
    â¢ Open-silicon electronic Identity Card -feasible with current tools, massive citizen impact,
      privacy-by-design
    â¢ Arduino-compatible microcontrollers -educational "pipe-cleaners" for EDA flows
Medium-term:
    â¢ Open PDKs at sub-90nm nodes
    â¢ Simple SoCs capable of running Linux
Long-term:
    â¢ Critical infrastructure chips: power grids, telecom backbone, healthcare, computing and AI
      accelerators
    â¢ Body implants -citizens deserve transparency on chips inside their bodies
Why this order? EDA tools are the enabler for everything else. Security-critical applications (RoT,
eID) are technically achievable now with 130nm open PDKs and have highest sovereignty impact.
Complexity scales gradually while the ecosystem matures.

Question 5: Sectors for Competitiveness and Cyber Resilience
Digital identity and public services: Open-silicon eID chips would enable citizens to verify the
chip identifying them to governments, banks, and healthcare. Open eID chips are attractive because
of their high volume and because of the way citizens may relate to such an important device.
Critical infrastructure: Power grids, telecommunications, public health systems rely on chips
potentially containing foreign backdoors. Open-source enables genuine security auditing.
Education: Open-source transforms chip design into an attractive field. Students can work even at
home without NDAs, understand algorithms rather than memorizing proprietary workflows. This
addresses the acute skill shortage.
Medical devices: Patients with pacemakers or other implants deserve transparency. Second Vision's
bankruptcy stranded patients with proprietary implants.
Consumer electronics sustainability: Open-source enables the 6Rs (refurbish, reuse, repair,
reliability, reduce, recycle). Device longevity requires documentation and tools for repurposing
(nearly impossible with proprietary silicon).
Automotive and industrial IoT: Open microcontrollers and open silicon in general can mitigate
chip shortages by enabling rapid foundry adaptation.
