Contribution to the Consultation and Call for Evidence:
Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems
Executive perspective: openness without adoption does not deliver sovereignty

From the perspective of a European Research Infrastructure operating at the intersection of
translational medicine, biomedical research, data, and AI, EATRIS-ERIC strongly supports the
ambition to strengthen European open digital ecosystems. Open digital solutions are essential
for interoperability, auditability, and long-term resilience in data-intensive and highly regulated
environments such as research and healthcare.

However, operational experience across multiple EU-funded initiatives demonstrates that
openness alone does not guarantee adoption, sustainability, or technological sovereignty.
Europeâs core digital challenge is not a lack of platforms or software, but a persistent gap
between technological potential and organisational capacity to implement, integrate, and
sustain open solutions in real-world settings.

Without targeted investment in human expertise, translation capacity, and long-term
operational support, open digital ecosystems risk remaining underutilised, particularly in SMEs,
research organisations, and healthcare systems operating under continuous regulatory and
resource pressure.

The âecosystem translationâ gap: technology does not fail, implementation does

Across our work in di erent initiatives, we consistently observe that:

    ï·   Organisations are already overwhelmed by existing digital ecosystems and competing
        priorities.

    ï·   Even mature, user-oriented platforms fail when local implementation expertise is
        insu icient.

    ï·   Adoption breaks down at the point where abstract digital capabilities must be translated
        into concrete workï¬ows, governance models, and compliance-ready data pipelines.

    ï·   Behavioural factors, institutional cultures, and persistent perceptions, such as the
        assumption that open-source solutions are inherently lower quality than proprietary
        alternatives, play a critical role in this breakdown.

Digital transformation is therefore not primarily a tooling problem, but a translation problem. It
requires the ability to translate complex cloud, data, and AI architectures into domain-speciï¬c
value, such as clinical research workï¬ows, biomarker validation pipelines, or federated data
analysis under strict regulatory constraints. This translation function requires sustained expert
capacity, continuous training, and proximity to users, not one-o technical delivery. European
Open Digital Ecosystems must explicitly recognise and address this systemic gap.

Competing with integrated global ecosystems requires more than modular openness

Global digital ecosystems succeed not simply because they are proprietary, but because they
are deeply integrated, continuously supported, and operationally easy to adopt. By contrast, a

fragmented collection of open-source components, however high-quality, does not by itself
constitute a usable ecosystem.

From a strategic standpoint, a credible European alternative must be:

    ï·   Interoperable by default, not only at the interface level, but across data models,
        identity and access management, governance, and lifecycle management.

    ï·   AI-ready, with built-in support for regulatory-grade federated learning, responsible AI,
        and emerging technologies such as Large Language Models.

    ï·   Operationally coherent, enabling organisations to deploy, maintain, and evolve
        systems without excessive bespoke engineering.

Without this level of integration, maintenance, and user-facing support, Europe risks reinforcing
dependency by obliging users to re-integrate open components into proprietary platforms to
achieve operational functionality.

Strategic investment must shift from âcode deliveryâ to âhuman infrastructureâ

Experience across Member States conï¬rms that providing open or free software is rarely a
su icient incentive for adoption. Digital initiatives routinely fail when organisations lack the
time, skills, or governance capacity to operationalise them, particularly in healthcare and
research environments.

To address this, the European Open Digital Ecosystems strategy should explicitly recognise
digital expertise as a form of infrastructure and include

    ï·   sustained funding for expert practitioners who can embed with organisations and
        support real-world implementation, onboarding, and training.
    ï·   continuous knowledge transfer mechanisms, communities of practice, and structured
        capacity-building programmes, rather than one-o training or documentation.
    ï·   long-term operational and maintenance support models that extend beyond short
        project cycles and ensure reliability, security, and regulatory compliance over time.

In the absence of durable funding models for maintenance, evolution, and security, European
open digital solutions are often left to degrade after project funding ends. Unlike global
platforms that invest continuously in reliability, lifecycle management, and user support,
European initiatives frequently lack a funded operational owner once development phases
conclude.

Research Infrastructures as durable operational anchors for open ecosystems

To make European open digital ecosystems operationally sustainable, dedicated funding
mechanisms should explicitly leverage Research Infrastructures (RIs) as long-term stewards of
digital tools and services. Unlike short-lived project consortia, RIs are structurally designed to
provide maintained access, user support, governance, and compliance over time.

RIs can act as durable operational layers for the maintenance, evolution, and secure access of
open digital tools, ensuring continuity beyond individual projects and reducing fragmentation
across initiatives. This role is particularly critical in regulated domains where trust,
accountability, and long-term availability are essential.

Dedicated, multiannual funding streams at both EU and national level could reinforce the role of
RIs in:

   ï·   Maintaining, securing, and upgrading shared open digital components.
   ï·   Providing structured access, onboarding, and training for new user communities,
       including SMEs, hospitals, and public research organisations.
   ï·   Sustaining expert teams that combine technical, regulatory, and domain-speciï¬c
       knowledge.
   ï·   Ensuring alignment with evolving European frameworks such as EOSC, the AI Act, and
       sectoral data spaces.

Implications for healthcare, research, and data-intensive sectors

In regulated, high-stake domains such as biomedical research and healthcare:

   ï·   Auditability, reproducibility, and governance are non-negotiable.

   ï·   Fragmentation increases cost, risk, and resistance to adoption.

   ï·   Open digital ecosystems must support end-to-end responsibility, from data generation
       to AI-driven decision support.

Open digital approaches can enable federated data access and AI development while
preserving institutional autonomy and regulatory compliance. In these contexts, openness
enables collaboration without centralisation of sensitive data, strengthening both trust and
resilience.

European Research Infrastructures can act as living testbeds, training hubs, and multipliers for
open digital ecosystems, provided that strategies address the full socio-technical system:
technology, people, governance, incentives, and sustainable funding.

Alignment with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)

The European Open Science Cloud provides an important enabling framework that aligns
closely with the objectives of European Open Digital Ecosystems. EOSCâs emphasis on
federated infrastructures, common standards, trusted services, and community-driven
governance helps lower integration barriers and promotes interoperability by design.

From a Research Infrastructure perspective, continued alignment between the European Open
Digital Ecosystems strategy and EOSC is essential to ensure that open solutions are not only
developed, but maintained, operationalised, reused, trained-for, and sustained across borders
and disciplines.

Conclusion: invest in people to make openness work

To realise technological sovereignty and competitiveness, Europe must rebalance its digital
investments:

   ï·   From tools to capabilities

   ï·   From pilots to operational ecosystems

   ï·   From short-term projects to durable funding models

   ï·   From code alone to human infrastructure

The success of European open digital ecosystems will depend less on the number of open
components produced and more on Europeâs ability to operationalise them sustainably in
complex, regulated environments. Without funded experts and institutions who understand
both global digital ecosystems and European regulatory, scientiï¬c, and organisational realities,
openness will remain a policy aspiration rather than an operational reality.

EATRIS-ERIC stands ready to contribute practical experience from its multi-national, data-
intensive programmes to help ensure that Europeâs open digital ecosystems are not only open
but usable, trusted, and sustainable.
