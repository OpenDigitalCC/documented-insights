Response from Symfony to the European Open Digital
Ecosystems Consultation

Respondent: Symfony

Subject: Contribution to the European Commissionâs upcoming Open Source Strategy

Symfony welcomes the European Commissionâs focus on the Open Digital Ecosystem. Born in
Europe 20 years ago, Symfony is a world leading PHP open source development framework
now powering over 20% of the professional web and supports a global community of 600,000
developers. It is a clear example of Europeâs ability to set global standards. Symfony is already
a pillar for European public services, used by the European Commission (DGIT), the French
Presidency, the German openDesk sovereign workplace, and the Swiss Open Government
Data portal. In the private sector, global leaders like LVMH and Spotify rely on Symfony, as do
many European "Mittelstand" companies. Furthermore, Symfony components are the foundation
for other major European technologies like Drupal, Sylius, Shopware, Akeneo, and Pimcore.
This success is driven by a massive European community with hubs in France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Spain, Poland, Lithuania, and many other countries.

We strongly believe that digital sovereignty cannot be created only by top-down laws; it is a
bottom-up reality built by developers. For the EU to lead, it must stop seeing open source as the
essential infrastructure of our modern economy. Currently, we face a value gap: European
developers create the code, but non-EU cloud companies capture the profit by selling that code
as a service.

To bridge this gap, Europe must foster a "Sovereign Stack" alliance. We need an industrial
strategy that helps European cloud leadersâsuch as OVHcloud, T-Systems, and
Scalewayâwork closely with the open-source projects they host. If these companies and the
open-source community work together, the money generated by European innovation will stay
in Europe. This will fund the training and skills of our next generation of developers. By aligning
our Cloud and AI laws with the needs of developers, we can turn open source into a competitive
advantage for European industry.
We must also change how we support the maintenance and safety of this ecosystem through 3
actionable measures:

   ââ A "Contribute-Back" Mandate in Procurement: The EU should update its Public
      Procurement Framework to include a mandatory "Sustainability Clause." When a public
      entity awards a contract that relies on open-source components, 1% to 2% of the
      contract value should be allocated for the upstream maintenance of those components.
      This ensures that the foundations or lead maintainers of the libraries used (like Symfony)
      receive the resources needed to keep the software secure for everyone.
   ââ
   ââ Institutionalizing the EU FOSSA Program: The EU FOSSA initiative proved that the
      Commission can successfully secure the software it uses. This should become a
      Permanent European Security Clearing House for Open Source. This office would
      provide continuous security audits, managed bug-bounty programs, and
      "Security-by-Design" certifications for key European projects. This makes it safer for
      public administrations, like the French Presidency or DGIT, to choose open source
      without fear of hidden vulnerabilities.
   ââ
   ââ Strategic Support for Open Source Foundations: The EU should treat foundations
      like the PHP Foundation or the Symfony ecosystem as "Digital Research
      Infrastructures." The Sovereign Tech Fund in Germany is already doing this, and the
      model should be scaled to the EU level. We propose a dedicated Foundation Grant
      under the Digital Europe Programme to provide 3-to-5-year funding cycles. This should
      focus on the "boring" but vital work of maintenance and security rather than just new
      features.

To deliver this support effectively, the Commission should take inspiration from the successful
models used to foster Research and Innovation (R&I) in Europe. Just as the EU provides
long-term stability for scientific research through Horizon Europe, it should apply similar
structures to open source. This includes developer-centric funding: instead of funding large,
bureaucratic organizations, the EU should use a "Direct Sponsorship" mechanism modeled after
GitHub Sponsors. This would allow the Commission to support the individual experts who
maintain critical libraries based on their actual technical impact, rather than their ability to write
complex grant applications.

Strategic priority must be given to the "mid-stack"âthe open source frameworks and libraries
where European business logic actually lives, not only the infrastructure. This is vital to remain
competitive in Artificial Intelligence. This is why we launched Symfony AI last year to help
developers use AI models within Symfony without being locked into a single AI provider.
However, the rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence presents a double-edged sword for European
sovereignty. While AI can increase productivity, it also threatens the business models of the very
maintainers who build our digital foundations. We see a growing risk where organizations
attempt to reduce their IT expenses by replacing human expertise with AI-generated code, often
trained on the open-source work of the community without compensation. Furthermore, a
dangerous skills gap is emerging: if companies use AI to perform entry-level tasks, they may
stop hiring junior developers. This breaks the essential handover of knowledge between senior
experts and the next generation. Without a steady stream of new talent learning the craft of
professional framework development, the human infrastructure of European digital sovereignty
will erode. Because AI is moving so fast, its long-term impact is hard to anticipate, but the
Commission needs to take this aspect into consideration and ensure that AI becomes a tool that
supports maintainers rather than a force that devalues their labor and depletes our talent pool.

Closing Perspective: Investing in the Architects of Digital Sovereignty

To achieve a truly competitive and sovereign digital future, Europe must recognize that open
source is not merely a technical choice, but a professional craft. The developers maintaining
Symfony and the open source ecosystem are the architects of Europeâs digital autonomy. The
EU must move beyond being a consumer of technology and become its primary builder. This
requires a two-fold commitment: first, providing the financial support through direct developer
sponsorship and long-term foundation grants that allow maintainers to treat this vital work as a
stable career; and second, ensuring legal protection through clear regulationsâlike a
balanced Cyber Resilience Actâthat protect individual innovators from corporate-scale
liabilities. By investing in the people who write the code, the European Union ensures that
our digital infrastructure remains open, transparent, and resilient. We must empower
these developers with the resources and the institutional recognition they need to keep
building the world's most trusted software right here in Europe.
