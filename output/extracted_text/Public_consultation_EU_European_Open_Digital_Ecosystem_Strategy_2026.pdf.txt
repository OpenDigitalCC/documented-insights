       Public consultation EU The
         European Open Digital
          Ecosystem Strategy
Wikimedia Germany e.V. is a nonprofit organization that supports the german-speaking
Wikipedia community and Wikidata next to other projects of the global Wiki Movement
that is dedicated to the common good. We support the people, technology, and policies
that enable reliable information to be shared with the world. The purpose of Wikimedia
e.V. is the promotion of the creation, collection, and dissemination of free content to
promote equal opportunities in access to knowledge and education. Wikipedia is already
the backbone of the internetâs knowledge. From students to chatbots, everyone is
learning from it. Wikipedia has been officially recognized as a DPG by the Digital Public
Goods Alliance in February 2025. Wikimedia e. V. has over 110.000 members and supports
many more volunteers in Germany and internationally via collaborations. Wikimedia e. V.
is representing civil society in the Board of the Internet Governance Forum Germany e. V.

We are grateful for being able to contribute to the EU Open Source Ecosystem strategy
that we will comment on the requested questions. However, we would like to highlight
the following point:

A free and Open Source Ecosystem at its core is a digital reflection of European
values. It emphasizes transparency and collaboration, thrives on diversity and is
grounded on fundamental human rights such as the protection of privacy. By
combining collaborative innovation with a strong commitment to transparency and
human rights, this approach offers a compelling model for the world and can help
Europe emerge as a geopolitical and geo-economic powerhouse.

Rich Free and Open Source communities:â
The European Union is home to a wide range of vibrant and mature free and open
source communities that have demonstrated an exceptional capacity for innovation and
technical excellence. Many free and open source solutions have been sustainably
developed and maintained over long periods, providing creative contributions to the
public good. Several of these projects have evolved into critical elements of the global
digital infrastructure, serving as foundational backbones for users, products, and services
worldwide.

Established democratic practices:â
Participation in free and open source projects constitutes a practical expression of
democratic engagement. The ability to collaborate openly, to contribute meaningfully
even through small individual efforts, and to work alongside contributors from diverse
social, cultural, and professional backgrounds fosters a shared sense of collective
responsibility. Free and open source ecosystems are grounded in principles of
transparency, collaboration, and shared ownershipâvalues that are deeply embedded in
European democratic traditions. Moreover, sustained engagement in such environments
reinforces behaviours and norms that actively supports and reinforces democratic
culture.

Significant potential for growth:â
Free and open source software has substantial capacity to drive both economic growth
and technological innovation, while simultaneously advancing the public interest.
Europe has been the birthplace or host of some of the worldâs most influential Free and
Open Source communities and projects. Platforms such as OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia,
and Wikidata function already as essential digital infrastructures underpinning a wide
range of downstream products and services, across both commercial and non-profit
sectors.

A robust regulatory framework:â
A thriving free and open source ecosystem depends on individuals who are willing to
contribute, collaborate, and share knowledge. For such participation to occur at scale,
contributors must be able to rely on the protection of their fundamental rights, ensuring
a safe and enabling environment for engagement. With regulatory instruments such as
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Digital Services Act (DSA), and a
strong and independent judicial system, Europe has already established a
comprehensive framework that supports these conditions.

Existing Strategies and EDIC to build upon:â
The creation of the Digital Commons EDIC (European Digital Infrastructure Consortium),
an EU instrument enabling Member States to jointly develop, deploy and operate
cross-border digital infrastructures, with a dedicated governance and legal personality,
was an important step to build together the foundations of a strong, open and

                                                                                Seite 2 von 6
sustainable European digital landscape. Also, the European Commissionâs Open Source
Strategy 2020â2023 provides a valuable foundation for future action. It articulated a clear
vision of a cultural shift toward openness, sharing, and reuse in software development,
while integrating considerations of security, privacy, legal compliance, and accessibility.
The strategy also expressed a commitment to actively supporting Free and Open Source
developer communities and was linked to the objective of achieving technological
sovereignty in key strategic areasâa goal that remains highly relevant today. While these
foundations are solid, future strategies will need to pursue more ambitious objectives
and be accompanied by more substantial and sustained policy actions.

Weaknesses
Limited awareness and insufficient knowledge of the existing free and open source
ecosystem:â
Europe is, in practice, a global Free and Open Source powerhouse, encompassing a wide
range of products as well as active and directly contributing communities, including
developers, maintainers, and users. However, the ingenuity, technical expertise, and
societal impactâparticularly of non-profit free and open source initiativesâremain
significantly under-researched and insufficiently documented. This knowledge gap
contributes to persistent biases in the assessment of the strategic potential of free and
open source software and undermines evidence-based policy development. For
example, a European Linked Open Data Infrastructure could build upon the world's
largest Open Knowledge Graph that is maintained in Berlin (Wikidata) but is not at all
represented in current strategy.

A prevailing focus on competition over cooperation:â
European integration is historically rooted in cooperation and shared values. Yet, in the
digital domain, policy approaches have often prioritised competitive models, such as the
creation of so-called âEuropean champions.â While such initiatives may have merit, a
distinctly European approach oriented toward the public good would place greater
emphasis on supporting and enhancing resilient digital networks and interoperable
ecosystems. These ecosystems would consist of mutually reinforcing nodes distributed
across Member States, rather than isolated centres of excellence. The previous open
source strategy referred to a âsociety empowered by dataâ; achieving this vision requires
embedding data empowerment within the principles of a shared, free, and open digital
ecosystem. The forthcoming strategy presents an opportunity to decisively advance this
objective.

Low visibility and persistent skills gaps:â
The visibility of successful and strategically important European open source projects
remains limited. Low awareness of existing solutions within both the public and private
sectors continues to inhibit wider adoption. This challenge is compounded by a
significant skills gap, particularly within public administrations, which urgently needs to

                                                                                 Seite 3 von 6
be addressed to enable sustainable uptake and long-term maintenance of open source
solutions.

Fragmentation across communities:â
The European open source landscape is characterised by fragmentation, with many
communities operating in relative isolation. This siloed structure constrains balanced
growth and limits opportunities for synergy, while also leading to duplicated efforts and
missed opportunities for shared innovation. Additional challenges include limited
cross-project knowledge exchange, insufficient resources for visibility and dissemination,
and a lack of stable institutional memory.

Limited funding and legal uncertainty:â
Many open source projects struggle to achieve financial stability, scalability, and
sustained visibility. Broader adoptionâparticularly by public sector actorsâcould
significantly improve funding prospects. At the same time, concerns related to
intellectual property management and potential legal liabilities continue to deter
organisations from adopting or contributing to open source solutions. Clearer legal
guidance and harmonised frameworks for intellectual property and liability would help
mitigate these risks and encourage wider participation.

Outdated procurement processes and legacy structures:â
Current public procurement practices often favour established proprietary solutions,
creating structural disadvantages for open source alternatives. Even where procurement
regulations are updated, entrenched legacy systems and long-standing vendor
relationships frequently hinder the transition to free and open source solutions within
public administrations.

Added Value
Free and open source software offers substantial benefits to both the public and private
sectors:

Cost efficiency and restructured value chains:â
By reducing dependency on costly proprietary software, organisations can reallocate
resources more effectively, enabling greater investment in innovation, maintenance, and
skills development.

Enhanced collaboration and innovation:â
Open source fosters collaborative environments that encourage innovation across
institutional and sectoral boundaries. The experience of contributingâeven in small
waysâto large-scale projects can be empowering, strengthening teamwork, civic
engagement, and democratic practices.

                                                                               Seite 4 von 6
Geopolitical opportunities grounded in European values:â
Free and open source software is inherently transparent and collaboration-oriented. As
digital infrastructures and governance models increasingly acquire geopolitical
significance, Europe is well positioned to offer an alternative to dominant global
paradigms. Partner countries would not be forced to choose between dependency on
U.S.-centric proprietary ecosystems or data-extractive, state-driven models. Instead, they
could participate in an open, federated digital ecosystem that respects cultural diversity,
data protection, and shared governance. Such collaboration has the potential to
strengthen international partnerships with positive spillover effects across other policy
domains.

Enhanced security:â
The transparency of open source codebases enables systematic scrutiny and
independent auditing, often resulting in more robust and trustworthy security outcomes
than closed, proprietary systems.

Reduced vendor lock-in and greater adaptability:â
The use of open standards and open source solutions reduces dependency on single
vendors and enhances strategic autonomy. Moreover, the adaptability of open source
allows solutions to be tailored to the needs of smaller stakeholder groups, supported by
a broad and diverse pool of skilled contributors.

Greater control and reduced dependency:â
Open source enables public and private actors to retain control over critical digital
infrastructures, reducing structural dependencies and increasing long-term resilience.

Reduced environmental footprint:â
Through reuse, longevity, and efficiency, open source solutions can contribute to more
sustainable digital practices and reduced environmental impact.

Concrete Actions
To effectively support and strengthen the European open source ecosystem, the
European Commission should consider the following actions:

Research, document, and showcase success stories:â
Fund systematic research on the state of the free and open source ecosystem in Europe,
including its non-profit components. Actively document and publicise successful
initiatives to gain information, reduce bias, build trust, and encourage broader adoption
across both public and private sectors. Such a research project would be a great start for
the EDIC for Digital Commons.

Recognise open source as a participatory and collaborative practice:â
Free and open source software is sustained by diverse forms of contribution and should

                                                                                Seite 5 von 6
be understood as a collaborative practice rather than a standalone product. The number
and diversity of contributors should be treated as key performance indicators. Policy
measures from other domainsâsuch as networking opportunities, visibility initiatives,
and support for skills developmentâshould be adapted to foster this environment,
building on the recommended research and mapping efforts.

Support and promote collaborative FOSS communities:â
Facilitate partnerships among public administrations, businesses, civil society
organisations, and research institutions to enable innovation, resource sharing, and
long-term sustainability across the open source landscape.

Increase public sector skills, literacy, and awareness:â
Empower civil servants to actively contribute to open source projects by hiring FOSS
developers within public institutions and strengthening internal IT capacities. Continue
and expand the Open Source Programme Office (OSPO) at the European Commission,
establish OSPOs across all Directorates-General, and encourage Member States to do the
same within their public administrations. Collaborate with educational institutions to
develop training programmes focused on free and open source technologies.

Enable and encourage reuse of EU open data:â
Develop a comprehensive framework guiding the full lifecycle of free and open source
projects, including best practices, interoperability standards, and sustainability
requirements. Build the reuse strategy around Wikidata and use the worlds largest
knowledge graph for the advancement of open data reuse.

Increase investment and reform procurement:â
Allocate substantial dedicated funding streams to support free and open source
projects, including maintenance work, security audits, grant schemes or matching funds
to incentivise community contributions and a thriving community network. Update
public procurement frameworks to ensure that free and open source solutions can
compete fairly, including through the assessment of total cost of ownership rather than
upfront costs alone.

By addressing these weaknesses and building on the existing strengths of the European
open source ecosystem, the European Commission can play a decisive role in fostering a
resilient, sustainable, and innovation-driven digital future for Europe.
