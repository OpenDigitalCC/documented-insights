    ITI Response to the Call for Evidence on European Open Digital
                               Ecosystems

                                                                            3 February 2026

Introduction

The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) appreciates the opportunity to provide
feedback to the European Commissionâs Call for Evidence on European Open Digital
Ecosystems.

ITI is the premier global advocate for technology, representing 80 of the worldâs most
innovative companies. Our membership spans across the entire spectrum of technology,
including global leaders in software and AI, hardware, cloud, cybersecurity, and
semiconductors. ITI promotes public policies and industry standards that advance
competition, innovation, and trust in the digital economy.

ITI welcomes the Commissionâs focus on strengthening the EU open source ecosystem. The
initiative comes at a moment when Europe is seeking to strengthen resilience and security in
its digital foundations while boosting competitiveness and innovation. Open source plays an
important role in this effort and is already deeply embedded across modern digital products
and services and widely embraced by the tech industry. Open source is developed and
maintained through decentralized, globally distributed communities, and modern software
supply chains are intrinsically global and interconnected. Policies designed to strengthen
Europeâs open source ecosystem should reflect this reality and focus on practical measures
that improve capacity, security, and deployment readiness â so that users in Europe can rely
on robust, competitive, secure, and trustworthy solutions.

In this context, while ITI recognizes Europeâs ambition to strengthen technological
sovereignty as a legitimate strategic objective, we underscore that effective technological
sovereignty cannot be achieved in isolation. Sovereignty should not be understood as a
rejection of global interdependences, but rather as Europeâs and European organizationsâ
ability to develop strategic strengths and act independently where needed, in ways that
remain consistent with openness and based on choice among diverse trusted providers
regardless of their development model.

Below, ITI sets out key considerations to support the Commissionâs work to strengthen open
digital ecosystems in a manner that advances security, resilience and effective technological
sovereignty â while preserving openness, choice, and trust in the digital economy.
The strategic value of open source for the EU

Wider integration of open source software (OSS) across the public and private sectors can
provide several benefits:
   â¢ Lowering barriers to entry: OSS can reduce costs and increase flexibility and
       scalability, helping SMEs, startups, and established companies to compete in fast-
       changing markets.
   â¢ Enabling public sector development and deployment: For governments developing
       sovereign LLMs, releasing them as open source can support the âpublic money, public
       codeâ principle, lowering barriers to adoption and supporting secure data storage and
       processing.
   â¢ Driving innovation and research: Open access can provide researchers with building
       blocks to run meaningful experiments, replicate results, and improve performance of
       solutions through wider collaboration.
   â¢ Enhancing collective security and safety: Sharing model weights and training data in
       AI development can enable broader safety testing, faster bug discovery, and pooled
       expertise to strengthen resilience and model quality.

To boost competitiveness and cyber resilience, the EU should prioritize targeted support for
open source where it can deliver clear benefits, including by enabling local innovation. Data-
intensive sectors such as autonomous vehicles and robotics may benefit in particular, by
improving visibility into training data and allowing developers to complement models with
their own datasets and expertise.

Competitiveness as a foundation for effective sovereignty

To fully realize these benefits at scale, sovereignty and competitiveness must be understood
as mutually reinforcing. Europe can be sovereign without excluding trusted non-EU players
by default. Being sovereign is not about rejecting non-EU products and services: effective
sovereignty is the ability to leverage best-in-class, reliable and secure technology, and it is
closely linked to Europeâs competitiveness. Sovereignty should be built on strength, not
isolation.

In this context, promoting a robust OSS ecosystem should rightly be an integral part of
Europeâs vision for technological leadership, and can be significantly advanced through
coordinated support and investment in the OSS ecosystem. A 2024 Harvard study found that
globally, the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion and the demand-side value
is much larger at $8.8 trillion. Firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than
they currently do if OSS did not exist (Hoffman, Nagle and Zhou, 2024). OSS already
contributes up to â¬95 billion annually to EU GDP, supported by over 21 million European
software developers.1 Targeted EU-led investment in OSS would build on this foundation and
broaden technological choice and control. By addressing vulnerabilities caused by under-

investment, Europe can build the leadership and resilience necessary to exercise genuine
choice among trusted providers â both European and international â while fostering
collaborative innovation and competitiveness.

This competitiveness imperative is directly linked to the needs of European users, especially
SMEs and startups, which depend on broad access to cost-effective, interoperable, reliable,
and secure services to scale and compete globally. Policies that would limit their options may
create competitive disadvantages. Technological choices should therefore be assessed on the
basis of technological merits such as features, security, functionality, openness, and the
ability of a provider to offer long-term stability and professional support.

Restrictive policies based on sovereignty criteria could limit the ability of European users to
access critical technologies. Instead, the focus should be on building trust-based, transparent
mechanisms that promote security, technical competence, and resilience.

Focusing on capacity-building and objective criteria

In the current context, the EU is rightly seeking to strengthen its security and the resilience of
the digital supply chain. However, policies that would bluntly equate geographic origin with
security would be misguided.

This is particularly important in the context of OSS. Open source is developed and maintained
through decentralized and often globally distributed communities, where contributors may
be located in many jurisdictions.2 More broadly, software is rarely written in isolation â
modern applications, including many proprietary products and services, integrate expansive
open source libraries upstream of release. As a result, calls for âEuropean open sourceâ
understood as software developed exclusively within the EU risks overlooking how software
supply chains function in practice. Approaches that would seek to operationalize sovereignty
through location-based restrictions or assumptions about origin would thus not be suited to
open source and would risk undermining the very collaboration that supports the security
and resilience of widely used components.

For these reasons, the EU should focus on practical measures that strengthen resilience at
scale. This includes building trusted, resilient and diversified supply chains, and incentivizing
collaboration with trusted technology providers that offer innovative and secure solutions.

In particular, ITI encourages the Commission to focus on strengthening OSS through practical
capacity-building measures, rather than replicating broader debates on procurement,
cybersecurity, and third-country access to data. A capacity-building approach should focus on
scalable measures that build on existing community and industry frameworks to avoid

duplication of efforts, aggregate best practices, and strengthen quality documentation for
OSS. It should support risk-based approaches and objective tools âincluding a common
taxonomy to analyze and communicate OSS risks â as well as intra-sectoral and public-private
information exchanges to identify emerging risks and develop mitigation strategies for
specific use cases.

Policymakers should promote a diversity of technological choices across public sector
organizations, recognizing the value of open source code adoption, while supporting the
broader OSS ecosystem through strategic investments and policy frameworks. This includes
funding security-focused personnel to improve critical OSS projects and joining industry
partners in financing improvements to OSS package repositories. To build long-term capacity,
governments should promote security education in university curricula for software
developers and create incentives for industry to fund OSS security improvements. In this
context, the Commission could also explore the development of a European Sovereign Tech
Fund as a mechanism to strengthen open digital infrastructure, provided funding remains in
recognition of the inherently global nature of OSS development and maintenance.3

Policymakers should leverage existing, well-vetted standards â such as NIST SP 800-218,
which has been undergoing conversion to broader international standards â rather than
developing bespoke frameworks that risk duplication and fragmentation. Security
frameworks must be risk-based and tailored to accommodate the unique characteristics of
incorporating open source components into software development, with OSS-specific
guidance remaining flexible and practical. OSS consumers should employ formal verification
and other advanced techniques to enhance software security. Policymakers should recognize
that cloud technologies and "as-a-service" delivery models enable more timely application of
security updates, contributing to overall digital resilience.

Additionally, the European Commission should establish a coordinated and structured
interaction with leading global open source foundations and organizations that host and
steward open source projects. Such engagement would help build awareness and
understanding of EU policy objectives within global open source communities, and create
pathways to explore how these objectives can be taken into account in project governance,
security practices, and long-term sustainability.

Ultimately, any consideration of future sovereignty criteria should remain firmly grounded in
objective criteria, technical and organizational controls, and governance, risk management
and transparency principles. These requirements would offer a more meaningful basis for
trust than nationality, legal immunity, or ownership structure.

Preserving choice and control in technology adoption

OSS, because of its transparency, accessibility, and adherence to open standards, can be an
important building block for sovereignty strategies when combined with integrated
technology environments.

The choice of adopting an open source or a proprietary solution should be based on the
specific needs for each use case. For certain use cases, or critical services and infrastructures,
public and private users expect not only secure and trusted technologies but also the ability
to maintain control over them, including governance of data, transparency into system
architecture, service level agreements, legal accountability and support, as well as
enforceable assurances of service continuity â while at the same time ensuring top-quality,
cybersecure and innovative services. In this context, it is important to work on safeguarding
security of the open source ecosystem through collaboration and standards.

Design of control should be guided by objective requirements and user needs, rather than
assumptions about any particular development model, and should be pursued based on open
technologies while recognizing the fundamental interdependence of open source and
proprietary approaches across the software ecosystem and focusing on practical outcomes
and verifiable assurances. Recognizing this interdependence also means ensuring continued
access to a full range of trusted technologies â both open source and proprietary â as an
essential component to support European innovation and competitiveness, and to leverage
Europeâs industrial strengths.
