  EU Consultation Feedback â Human-Centric and
             Open Digital Ecosystem

Policy Area

Digital Rights, Digital Governance, Open Digital Ecosystems, Digital Strategic Autonomy

Objective of the Contribution

To support the development of a human-centric, open, and sovereign European Digital Ecosystem
through a rights-based regulatory framework that strengthens democratic governance, professional
accountability, and citizensâ trust.

Context and Rationale

The digital domain has become a European Digital Public Space where fundamental rights are
exercised and essential services are delivered. This space requires democratic governance under
the rule of law, comparable to territorial, maritime, and airspace domains, in line with the European
Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles.

Key Proposal

The proposal introduces a comprehensive governance framework based on Digital Strategic
Autonomy, recognizing enforceable rights over personal and collective digital assets, establishing
an Independent Digital Public Authority for Regulation and Guarantee (SIN), and defining
mandatory professional accountability for critical digital roles.

Governance and Institutional Framework

An Independent Digital Public Authority coordinates digital policies, assists citizens, regulates
operators, and cooperates with EU institutions and national authorities. Its mission is to ensure
resilience, continuity, and protection of fundamental rights in the European Digital Public Space.

Professional Accountability

Legally defined roles of Certified Digital Professionals and Certified Digital Support Practitioners are
introduced. A mandatory License to Code certifies competence, ethical conduct, and legal
accountability for individuals performing critical digital functions.

Impact on Public and Private Actors
Public and private organizations are required to employ licensed professionals for digital functions
affecting systems, data, security, and essential services. Non-compliance is subject to
proportionate and effective sanctions.

Digital Artifacts and Supply Chain Security

Executable Digital Artifacts must ensure traceable authorship and accountability through
cryptographic signatures linked to valid professional licenses. License revocation renders artifacts
invalid for execution until compliance is restored.

Open Source and Openness

The framework fully supports Free and Open Source Software. Licensing requirements apply
exclusively to professional responsibility in regulated execution contexts and do not limit access,
modification, or redistribution of source code.

Expected European Added Value

The proposal strengthens trust, interoperability, security, and democratic oversight across the
European Digital Ecosystem, contributing to Digital Strategic Autonomy while preserving openness,
innovation, and fundamental rights.
