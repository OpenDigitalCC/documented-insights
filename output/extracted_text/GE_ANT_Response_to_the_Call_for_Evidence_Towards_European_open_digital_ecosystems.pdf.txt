Feedback to the call for evidence Towards European open digital
ecosystems
The GÃANT Association welcomes the European Commission initiative to set out a
strategic approach to the open-source sector. A strengthened EU open-source sector can
contribute signiï¬cantly to Europeâs technological sovereignty and the cybersecurity
agenda, and we call for the support of the European Union to create the framework
conditions for this. Speciï¬cally, we would welcome the designation of key open-source
components as critical to allow sustained funding and governance beyond the initial
development.

Weaknesses of the EU open-source sector

   â¢   In practice, commercial solutions are often favoured because they are seen as
       quicker to deploy, better aligned with existing procurement frameworks, and more
       capable of meeting compliance requirements, especially in the area of security,
       where regulation has expanded signiï¬cantly in recent years. Smaller open-source
       initiatives struggle to participate on equal footing and to satisfy these requirements.
   â¢   This challenge is compounded by a poor understanding of open source as a
       concept, including limited awareness of appropriate funding and contribution
       models. Open-source software (OSS) developer teams frequently face diQiculties in
       scaling from strong technical delivery to a full business oQering, as good coding
       does not automatically translate into viable business models.
   â¢   There is a decline in the developer communities within public sector organisations
       which once led OSS initiatives. This has been exacerbated by the loss of skilled staQ
       to commercial entities.
   â¢   Sustained funding remains scarce, with support often fragmented into small, short-
       term grants, such as those under the NGI approach, and there is insuQicient focus
       at EU level on conservancy models, despite examples such as the Commons
       Conservancy oQering potential solutions.
   â¢   For many organisations, the choice between commercial and open-source is based
       on risk-management decisions, where the cost of investing internally to make other
       solutions workable does not correspond with operational reality.
The value of open source in the face of tech dependencies

The value of open source cannot be overstated, especially when considering factors like
cost, risk, and innovation. For one, using open-source solutions helps avoid vendor lock-in
and reduces the risk of being held to ransom when dependencies form. In principle, open-
source solutions allow for more bespoke development and greater inï¬uence over the
features that are important to the users rather than being driven by external commercial
priorities. The utilisation of highly skilled local staQ contributes to the growth and capability
of these organisations to make informed technical decisions rather than acting merely as
consumers. Finally, open-source increases choice in the marketplace and supports a
richer ecosystem where service changes are easier to achieve (no vendor lock-in) and
potentially more innovative than some commercial alternatives. Considering the value of
open source towards achieving digital sovereignty, open source has to be treated as
infrastructure rather than innovation. By identifying strategically important open-source
components as critical, they can be supported through long-term funding and sustainable
mechanisms â for maintenance, security, and governance â that go beyond initial
development.

How can the EU support the European open-source sector?

â¢   We need to be proactive in changing our culture and our approaches, rather than
    waiting until paid-for services develop away from user needs.
â¢   We need greater emphasis on rebuilding technical skills in universities and valuing
    highly skilled staQ alongside purchase models for a truly rich open-source environment.
â¢   We need a shift in perceptions on how open-source support models are ï¬nancially
    support, including changes in procurement practices to consider the conditions under
    which open source solutions operate.
â¢   We need neutral foundations behind open-source initiatives, clear accountability and
    governance models, and a reduced dependence on single maintainers.
â¢   We need the European open-source toolset to be competitive and feature-rich to
    encourage users to make the switch from proprietary alternatives.
