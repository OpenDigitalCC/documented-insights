Updated Submission â Call for Evidence: âTowards European
open digital ecosystemsâ (Q1 2026)
This updated submission aligns explicitly with the Commission Call for Evidence for the
Communication to the European Parliament and the Council. It addresses the requested topics
across the full open-source lifecycle (development â deployment â maintenance â
sustainability â market integration), with emphasis on EU competitiveness, technological
sovereignty, and cybersecurity.

Perspective: system architect and operator working with open, cooperative digital infrastructure across digital identity,
governance, accounting, AI-supported systems, and civic digital twins.

Executive highlights (actionable points)
â¢   Shift EU support from âproject creationâ to âinfrastructure stewardshipâ: long-term maintenance,
    security, and governance operations.

â¢   Build EU-centred foundation infrastructure for open source (trusted repositories, CI/CD, artifact
    signing, SBOM pipelines, coordinated vulnerability handling).

â¢   Reform procurement to enable adoption of open solutions with audit-based accountability and lifecycle
    support contracts (not vendor lock-in).

â¢   Prioritise AI, cloud, edge/IoT, cybersecurity, internet technologies, open hardware (e.g., RISCâ V), and
    industrial stacks (automotive/manufacturing).

â¢   Treat open source as a strategic lever for supply-chain transparency, vulnerability management, and
    reduced dependency on non-EU dominant platforms.

1. Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector; barriers to adoption,
maintenance, and sustainable contributions
Strengths

â¢   A large and active developer community with strong alignment to EU digital rights and principles,
    enabling trust-based collaboration across borders.

â¢   Research depth and engineering excellence in privacy, cryptography, distributed systems,
    interoperability, and verification.

â¢   Institutional legitimacy in public deployments: openness supports transparency, auditability, and
    democratic oversight.

Weaknesses / structural constraints

â¢   Maintenance gap: critical components are often under-funded and reliant on a small number of
    maintainers.

â¢   Fragmented support: funding often rewards novelty over operational continuity (LTS releases, incident
    response, governance).

â¢   Value capture leakage: EU-created value is frequently productised and monetised outside the EU,
    while EU stakeholders face network effects from dominant platforms.

â¢   Limited access to procurement, growth capital, and hosting/infrastructure (repositories, cloud,
    software-defined infrastructure tools) for EU projects and SMEs.
Main barriers to adoption and sustainable contribution

â¢   Procurement and compliance models optimised for proprietary vendors, not open components with
    shared responsibility.

â¢   Deployment and usability barriers: organisations can adopt code but struggle to operate it reliably
    (packaging, documentation, integration, support).

â¢   Software supply-chain security: inconsistent SBOM practices, weak signing/attestation, and
    fragmented vulnerability handling across ecosystems.

â¢   Governance ambiguity: unclear decision rights, maintainer succession, and enforcement of contributor
    standards once projects scale.

â¢   Market integration barriers: costly integration with legacy systems and insufficient interoperability
    incentives.

2. Added value of open source for public and private sectors (examples, cost, risk,
lock-in, security, innovation)
Lock-in and cost (lifecycle): Open source reduces lock-in structurally (right to inspect, modify, and
migrate). For long-lived public systems (identity, registries, archives, core administrative platforms),
lifecycle costs are reduced through reuse and interoperability, and by avoiding forced upgrades or
vendor-imposed migrations.

Security and resilience: Transparency enables independent audits, faster vulnerability discovery, and
shared remediation. Open components also support supply-chain transparency and vulnerability
management when paired with modern assurance practices (SBOMs, signed artifacts, reproducible builds,
and coordinated disclosure).

Innovation and competitiveness: Open source increases composability and local productisation. SMEs
and scale-ups can build services on open stacks without negotiating restrictive licensing, improving
time-to-market and enabling sector-specific European offerings.

Concrete operational example pattern: An open identity + access-control layer combined with open
auditing and policy enforcement makes it possible to deploy AI-supported public services with traceability
and accountability, while preserving sovereignty over core infrastructure.

3. EU-level measures to support growth, technological sovereignty, and cybersecurity
â¢   Fund stewardship: Establish EU Open Infrastructure Maintenance Funds that pay for maintainers,
    LTS releases, governance operations, documentation/usability work, and security response.

â¢   EU-centred foundation infrastructure: Provide trusted EU-hosted capabilities (mirrored repositories,
    secure CI/CD, artifact signing, attestations, SBOM tooling, and coordinated vulnerability intake/triage).

â¢   Procurement reform: Publish model procurement clauses and frameworks that allow contracting for
    open solutions with lifecycle support (including foundations/cooperatives/non-profits), and shift from
    âvendor liability onlyâ to audit-based accountability.

â¢   Security-by-default programmes: Co-fund security audits, bug bounties, and certification pathways
    for widely used components; require SBOMs and signed releases for publicly funded deployments.

â¢   Strengthen OSPO capacity: Expand public-sector Open Source Programme Offices (OSPOs) and
    create cross-border playbooks for contribution, compliance, and incident response.

â¢   Publicâprivate partnerships: Support sustainable business models for EU open-source companies
    and foundations, including partnerships for industrial deployment.
â¢   Integrate with existing EU initiatives: Use the European Digital Infrastructure Consortium for Digital
    Commons and related programmes as vehicles to sustain and scale interoperable âdigital commonsâ
    for public services.

4. Priority technology areas (and rationale)
â¢   Cloud and sovereign platform services: open components for compute, storage, networking,
    observability, policy enforcement, and portability.

â¢   AI infrastructure (beyond models): evaluation, provenance, dataset governance, orchestration, and
    responsible deployment toolchains.

â¢   Cybersecurity: monitoring, incident response, cryptography, verification, secure update mechanisms,
    and supply-chain assurance.

â¢   Edge / IoT and internet technologies: interoperability layers and secure middleware to reduce
    fragmentation.

â¢   Open hardware: ecosystems such as RISCâ V and open designs supporting HPC/edge computing
    and reduced dependency.

â¢   Industrial open stacks: software-defined vehicle and manufacturing platforms enabling European
    product ecosystems and standardisation.

5. Sectors where increased use of open source could raise competitiveness and cyber
resilience
â¢   Public administration (identity, registries, citizen services) and cross-border interoperability.

â¢   Healthcare interoperability and clinical data infrastructure.

â¢   Energy systems and climate/carbon accounting supply chains.

â¢   Education and research infrastructure (repeatable, verifiable tooling).

â¢   Smart cities and digital twins (open standards + auditable governance).

â¢   Automotive and manufacturing (industrial open stacks, software-defined platforms, edge computing).

Conclusion (what would move the needle)
If the EU wants practical digital sovereignty and cybersecurity, the policy focus should move from
supporting isolated projects to operating open digital infrastructure as a sustained, governed ecosystem.
That means funding maintenance and security, strengthening EU-hosted foundation infrastructure, making
procurement lifecycle-ready, and prioritising deployment and usability alongside innovation.
