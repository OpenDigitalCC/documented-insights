Empowering Maritime Innovation with Open-Source VesselAI: TwinShipâs Vision

The TwinShip project (https://twin-ship.eu ) builds upon the foundations laid by the
Horizon 2020 VesselAI project (https://vessel-ai.eu ), proposing the integration of its
open-source digital platform to support innovation in the maritime sector. One of
TwinShipâs core innovations is this Advanced VesselAI Digital Platform, a fully open-
source solution designed to foster cross-sector collaboration and accelerate maritime
digitalization.

The Challenge

Today, the maritime industry remains heavily dependent on proprietary digital
platforms, which:

   â¢   Restrict access to external R&D initiatives

   â¢   Limit interoperability and data sharing

   â¢   Hinder the validation of AI/ML technologies

   â¢   Slow down sector-wide innovation

TwinShipâs Breakthrough

To overcome these barriers, TwinShip is leveraging and expanding the capabilities of the
VesselAI platform by embedding it into its Digital Twin (DT) and Decision Support
System (DSS) framework. The enhanced platform features:

   â¢   Large-scale data processing for complex maritime datasets

   â¢   Federated data sharing with encryption to ensure secure collaboration

   â¢   Semantic interoperability using shared vocabularies and industry ontologies for
       seamless integration

Deployment and Impact

The platform is already operational at the Institute of Communication and Computer
Systems (ICCS), NTUA in Athens, with deployment at UiT â The Arctic University of
Norway in TromsÃ¸ currently underway.

By enabling trusted, scalable, and secure collaboration between academia, research
institutions, and industry, TwinShipâs open-source platform sets the stage for
accelerated maritime innovationâensuring data protection, transparency, and long-
term resilience.
