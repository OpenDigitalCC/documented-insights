Further suggestions for possible ways of promoting open-source software and
communities:

  1. Identify the areas lacking open-source alternatives to proprietary software. The
     focus should be on general purpose tools, with a large (potential) user base, and
     on building collaborative communities of stakeholders. If open-source projects
     exist already which could cover a specific requirement, these could be supported
     by either making grants available to developer teams, for example through a new
     or existing European Science Cluster or Research Infrastructure Consortium, or
     by having the software adopted by a publicly funded developer team.
  2. Create a requirement for software-related projects receiving EU financial support
     to use open-source licencing for any source code released.
  3. Consider publishing data on proprietary license fees paid by public sector
     organisations to estimate the potential gain from switching to open-source
     alternatives.
  4. Make sure that software backed by the governments of EU member states is not
     tied to a specific software platform. For example, if state-endorsed software for
     filing income tax returns is available to the citizens of an EU country, it should be
     possible to use it from several different operating systems.
  5. In a long-term perspective, introduce the subject of open licenses (including
     software licenses) to the school curriculum. This will be important not only to
     future programmers, but also to a wider community of content creators
     publishing their work online.
