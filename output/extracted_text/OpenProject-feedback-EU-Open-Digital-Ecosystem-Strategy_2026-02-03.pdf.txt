OpenProjectâs feedback to The European Open Digital
Ecosystem Strategy

1. Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector and
main barriers
Strengths of the EU open-source sector
From OpenProjectâs perspective, the EU open-source ecosystem has developed significant
structural strengths over the past years.
   â¢   First, awareness and acceptance in the public sector are clearly increasing. Open source
       is no longer seen primarily as a technical alternative, but as a strategic instrument to achieve
       digital sovereignty, interoperability, transparency, and long-term cost control. Initiatives
       such as Schleswig-Holsteinâs open-source strategy demonstrate that these goals can be
       achieved and could be implemented at scale. A European exchange of experiences fosters
       this new open source approach.
   â¢   Second, the EU benefits from a strong engineering, research, and SME base. A growing
       number of European companies build sustainable business models around open source
       software, increasingly also in coordinated, ecosystem approaches such as openDesk, La
       Suite, or Mijn Bureau. Those initiatives should even more collaborate on a European level.
       And also much smaller open source projects are growing. This strengthens European
       technological capacity while keeping value creation local (public money invested in the EU
       (and not shipped overseas) ends in public code).
   â¢   Third, many established open-source projects operate with mature governance structures
       and a proven track record for successful public and private usage at scale, including
       predictable release cycles, transparent decision-making, and traceability of changes. These
       characteristics are particularly relevant for public-sector use and larger organizations, where
       accountability and auditability are critical. There are already many great success stories of
       open source software implementation, also from our side.
Weaknesses and structural challenges
Despite these strengths, several systemic weaknesses remain to be solved:
   â¢   A key challenge is procurement and adoption. Public administrations frequently develop
       or procure similar solutions in parallel, apply inconsistent evaluation criteria, and rarely
       reuse solutions across organisational or national boundaries. This limits efficient scaling and
       slows down learning effects.
   â¢   Underfunding of maintenance remains a challenge. Essential work such as security
       hardening, documentation, accessibility improvements, and support is rarely financed
       sustainably. A stronger and more consistent preference for open-source solutions in public
       procurement would significantly improve the sustainability of open-source vendors and their
       ability to invest in long-term maintenance.
   â¢   Furthermore, there are skills and capacity gaps within (public) administrations. Many
       organisations lack experience with open-source-specific procurement and also usage,
       internal service ownership, technical maintenance and structured contribution processes,
       including legal and security reviews for upstream contributions.
   â¢   Many organizations underestimate the change management aspect while managing the
       transition from closed source to open source. Such a transition is a major change initiative
       for organizations and should be prepared and executed carefully. Users switching to new
       OSS products need guidance on their journey of change (e.g. education on FOSS, support in
       use case translation from one product to another, trainings).
   â¢   Education on FOSS, also outside of a technical bubble, is very relevant. Especially many
       decision makers on C-level do not necessarily understand the benefits of FOSS products and
       communities. There are many myths on open-source, which need to be addressed. A proper
       education on FOSS and exchange of experiences could speed up transition from closed
       source to open-source.
Main barriers to adoption, maintenance, and sustainable contributions
From our experience, the most significant barriers include:
   â¢   Procurement practices that favour proprietary models, focusing on short-term feature
       comparisons (e.g. Jira vs. OpenProject, Microsoft vs. ...) rather than long-term public value,
       reuse potential, sovereignty, and maintainability. OSS-specific procurement is still not very
       common and not yet the preferred option.
   â¢   Perceived risks from open source, especially around security and continuity, but also loss
       of efficiency, despite the transparency and auditability benefits that open source provides.
   â¢   High friction for public-sector contributions and adaption, caused by unclear legal
       guidance, missing Open Source Programme Offices (OSPO-like structures), and the absence
       of standardised processes for the possibility of contributing improvements upstream. As well
       as a lack of accompanying necessary change processes within the organization to foster the
       adoption. OSS implementations often fail not because of the product, but because of a lack
       of project management and change management, training, and ownership.
Addressing this was already identified as a priority in the Commissionâs Open Source Software
Strategy.
2. Added value of open source for public and private sectors
Added value for the public sector
Open source creates concrete and measurable value for public administrations.
   â¢   A central benefit is digital sovereignty and control over data and deployment.
       Administrations can self-host solutions or select trusted EU-based hosting providers, retain
       control over sensitive operational data, and reduce structural dependencies on non-EU
       hyperscalers or single vendors. OpenProject explicitly supports both self-hosting and EU-
       based hosting models to meet these requirements.
   â¢   Open source also reduces vendor lock-in and improves interoperability. Open standards
       and transparent interfaces make it easier to switch providers, audit integrations, and ensure
       long-term access to all data.
   â¢   Furthermore, transparency and auditability are intrinsic advantages. Access to source
       code enables security reviews, compliance verification, and public accountability, which are
       particularly important in critical public services.
   â¢   Finally, open source enables reuse at scale. Once a solution is adopted and improved by one
       administration, it can be reused by others, reducing duplicated spending and accelerating
       digital delivery across the public sector.
Added value for the private sector
   â¢   Also for private sector the same benefits of digital sovereignty and data ownership apply.
   â¢   For private organisations, open source enables faster innovation and broader ecosystem
       choice. Companies can integrate, extend, and adapt software without restrictive licensing
       constraints and collaborate more easily across organisational boundaries.
   â¢   At the same time, switching costs and dependency risks are reduced. The ability to audit
       code, self-host, or source support from multiple providers mitigates systemic risks
       associated with single-vendor dependency.
   â¢   Invest in European open-source technologies would result in many new jobs within EU
       and would boost European economy. A study by Cigref gives a very tangible simulation
       on that (source: https://www.cigref.fr/technological-dependence-on-american-software-and-
       cloud-services-an-assessment-of-the-economic-consequences-in-europe).
       â¦ 80% of total spending on cloud software and services for business use in Europe went to
           US companies, representing a volume of â¬265 billion.
       â¦ This spending, relating exclusively to cloud software and services for business use,
           represents approximately 2 million direct, indirect, and induced jobs in the US.
       â¦ The study also considers future scenarios. If 15% of this spending were retained within
            the European economy by 2035, around 500,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs
            would be created, benefiting the European economy.
Concrete example: OpenProject
OpenProject is an open-source project management and collaboration software supporting classic,
agile, and hybrid teams. It is widely used in public - as well as private-sector companies where data
sovereignty, security, accessibility, and transparency are mandatory requirements.
Open source is not just software, it shapes working methods, collaboration, and responsibility. OSS
forces organizations to take transparency, collaboration, and responsibility seriously. This is
particularly relevant in project management, where silos, shadow plans, and lack of transparency
are common.
OpenProject is often chosen because it enforces this transparency, not despite it.
In practice, public administrations evaluate open-source solutions like OpenProject against criteria
such as:
   â¢   lock-in risk and exit options (data portability, interoperability),
   â¢   security and compliance posture (auditability, updates, transparency),
   â¢   hosting and data residency options (self-hosted or EU-based hosting),
   â¢   total cost of ownership over the full lifecycle, not only initial licensing costs.
   â¢   the option to collaborate on product development with the open source community, provide
       feedback, sponsoring, or even upstream contributions with own developments (we have
       quite a few success stories here for "private money, public code, public know-how").

3. EU-level measures to support the open-source sector and
technological sovereignty
Procurement and adoption
Procurement criteria should be modernised to explicitly value open source and open standards,
portability, security maintenance commitments, and proven community governance, rather
than (proprietary) vendor reputation alone. The EU should make âreuse firstâ a practical reality,
supported by reusable building blocks, reference architectures, and clear guidance on when to reuse,
buy, or build.
In addition, OSS-friendly procurement such as frameworks or purchasing systems should be
expanded to enable SME participation and to procure maintenance and support, not just the initial
delivery.
Organizations should be vigilant about"open washing"- when companies, especially big tech
companies, falsely brand their products as âsovereignâ or open source or open standards to gain
trust or market share while maintaining proprietary control. This deceptive marketing can lead
organizations to adopt products that do not truly offer the transparency, flexibility, or data
sovereignty they expect. It's especially crucial when evaluating so-called "sovereign" solutions from
big tech companies, as these may still involve dependencies, jurisdictional exposure, or hidden
vendor lock-in.
Sustainability and maintenance funding
Maintenance should be treated as critical digital infrastructure. Multi-year, outcome-oriented
commitment is needed for security updates, dependency management, accessibility, documentation,
and localisation.
Targeted support should focus on critical dependencies and public-sector backbone tools,
including collaboration platforms, identity systems, document collaboration, and interoperability
components, building on the Commissionâs existing strategic direction.
We as open source providers need predictability (multi-year contracts, clear responsibilities). Any
short-term project funding or one-off contracts do little to foster innovation and sustainability.
Without planning security, us as European OSS providers find it difficult to compete with US
corporations.
Security
EU-level support mechanisms could include coordinated vulnerability disclosure support,
funded security audits for widely used projects, and practical secure-by-design guidance
tailored to open source.
Shared compliance artefacts such as templates, checklists, and reference controls would
significantly reduce duplicated compliance work for both OSS suppliers and public buyers.
Capability building
Public administrations should be supported in establishing OSPO-like structures, alongside
standardised contribution policies covering legal, security, and release management aspects,
enabling sustainable upstream contributions instead of local forks.

4. Priority technology areas
From OpenProjectâs perspective, priority should be given to horizontal enablers that create
leverage across sectors:
   â¢   Secure collaboration and productivity tools for the public sector (project and portfolio
       management, collaboration workflows, knowledge management, document management), as
       they are foundational for delivery capacity and cross-organizational coordination and
       currently face high lock-in risks.
   â¢   Interoperability and data portability tooling (open APIs, open standards, integration
       layers, identity federation) to reduce fragmentation and enable cross-border services.
   â¢   Cybersecurity foundations for open source, secure build pipelines, signing, and
       vulnerability management, to reduce risks.
   â¢   Cloud and deployment sovereignty enablers, such as container orchestration and
       sovereign on-premises hosting to preserve choice of hosting and jurisdiction.
   â¢   Trustworthy and open AI, 6including open and auditable AI models, transparent training
       and inference pipelines, and AI tooling that can be deployed and operated under public-
       sector control. Prioritising open approaches to AI is essential to avoid new forms of lock-in,
       ensure accountability, and enable responsible use of AI in public administration. See AI not
       as a âproductâ but as a function within existing open source stacks.
These priorities align closely with the Commissionâs focus on autonomy, reuse, and security.

5. Sectors with high potential for competitiveness and cyber
resilience gains
An increased use of open source would be particularly impactful in:
   â¢   Public administration and government services, where large portfolios of internal and
       citizen-facing systems could face sanctions and will benefit from reduced lock-in, higher
       transparency, and greater sovereignty.
   â¢   Critical infrastructure and regulated sectors such as energy, transport, health, public
       safety, which require transparency and resilience against concentrated dependencies.
   â¢   Education and research, where open collaboration, reproducibility, and skills development
       are natural fits.
   â¢   SME, open source ecosystems, where it enables collaboration, building strong European
       companies and foster the open source ecosystems and partnerships.
After all, across all sectors, open source improves cyber resilience through transparency, the
ability to self-host, and reduced single-supplier risk.
