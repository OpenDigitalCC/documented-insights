1 What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source
  sector? What are the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and
  maintenance of high-quality and secure open source; and (ii)
  sustainable contributions to open-source communities?
1.1 Diagnosis: Strengths and Weaknesses of the EU Open Source Sector
A. Strengths
   â¢   High-Calibre Talent Pool & Developer Community: The EU is home to one of the world's
       largest, most active, and highly skilled communities of open source contributors. European
       developers are disproportionately represented in core infrastructure projects (e.g., Linux kernel,
       embedded systems). European organizations recognize open source as essential for digital
       sovereignty, with 69% believing OSS adoption increases productivity and creates opportunities
       for advancing AI projects and reducing vendor dependency.
   â¢   Technical excellence in strategic domains: European open-source projects have achieved
       strong positions in critical areas including high-performance computing, edge computing, cloud
       infrastructure, and cybersecurity. EU-funded initiatives like Next Generation Internet, FIWARE,
       and the Digital Commons European Digital Infrastructure Consortium demonstrate proven
       capability to develop world-class open technologies
   â¢   Regulatory & Value Alignment: The inherent transparency and auditability of OSS align
       perfectly with European values and regulatory frameworks, specifically GDPR, the AI Act, and
       the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). OSS is the only viable mechanism to guarantee the "security
       by design" and digital sovereignty that EU policy mandates.
   â¢   Strong Research & Industrial Base: Through programs like Horizon Europe, the EU excels at
       funding early-stage innovation. Furthermore, Europe leads in industrial engineering
       (automotive, manufacturing, robotics). This creates a natural "home turf" advantage for OSS in
       Industrial IoT, Edge Computing, and open hardware (e.g., RISC-V).
   â¢   Emerging Political Will: Initiatives like the NGI (Next Generation Internet) and the recognition
       of Digital Commons as a strategic asset demonstrate a shifting political mindset towards
       supporting open infrastructure.
B. Weaknesses
   â¢   The "Valley of Death" in Commercialization: While Europe is excellent at funding research
       (creating code), it fails at funding commercialization (building products). There is a chronic lack
       of growth capital for OSS scale-ups compared to the US, leading to European innovations being
       acquired or monetized by non-EU tech giants.
   â¢   Lack of strategic maturity: the Linux Foundation Europe's 2025 research revealed that 66%
       of European organizations lack a formal open-source strategy and 78% have not implemented
       an open-source program office (OSPO). This strategic immaturity hampers coordination,
       investment decisions, and systematic contribution to open-source ecosystems.
   â¢   Institutional Vacuum and Lack of Policy Coordination (The OSPO Gap): There is a critical
       absence of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) at the national and regional levels across
       many Member States. While some pioneers exist, there is no pan-European network to
       harmonize OSS policies. Impact: This leads to a "fragmented sovereignty" where each country
       reinvents the wheel. Without a central mandate or coordinated strategy at the EU level, best
       practices for OSS governance, licensing, and security remain siloed, preventing the emergence
       of a unified European digital market.

                                              Page 4 z 43
â¢   Absence of a "Public Money, Public Code" Mandate: There is currently no legal obligation
    for the public sector to publish software developed with taxpayer funds into public repositories.
    Impact: Vast amounts of high-quality code developed for local or national administrations
    remain "dark" (proprietary or hidden). This lack of transparency prevents other Member States
    from reusing existing solutions, leading to massive financial waste and missed opportunities for
    cross-border interoperability.
â¢   Fragmented Collaboration: The "Snowdrop" Syndrome: Cooperation between countries on
    shared codebases is the exception, not the rule. While there are promising "snowdrops" (early
    signs of spring) such as the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) for the EUDI Wallet
    or the EDIC for Digital Commons, these remain isolated projects rather than a standard
    operational model. Impact: Instead of building a "European Tech Stack," Member States
    continue to procure 27 different versions of similar systems, failing to achieve the economies of
    scale that would allow EU solutions to compete with global tech giants.
â¢   Procurement Bias and Systemic Exclusion (The "Brand Name" Trap): Public procurement
    often features explicit or implicit bias toward proprietary vendors. As highlighted in the 2025
    Instrat Foundation report, it is a common (and detrimental) practiceâfor example, in
    Polandâto specify brand names like Microsoft or Google in Terms of Reference (SWIZ/SIWZ)
    for cloud services or office suites. Impact: This creates an uneven playing field where OSS is
    effectively excluded from the start. It cements dependency on non-EU vendors and prevents
    local OSS-based companies from competing for public contracts, even when their solutions are
    more cost-effective and secure.
â¢   Educational Dependency: The "Classroom-to-Cloud" Pipeline: Open source literacy is
    missing from school curricula. Instead of teaching students vendor-neutral computational logic,
    many Member States subsidize the adoption of Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace in schools.
    Impact: This creates early-age "vendor lock-in," training the next generation of workers to be
    proficient only in specific proprietary tools. It stifles the development of a culture of "openness"
    and prevents students from understanding the underlying mechanics of the technology they
    use.
â¢   Chronic Underfunding of the "Human Infrastructure" (Volunteers): There are no dedicated
    EU-wide funds to support the individual maintainers and volunteer communities who uphold
    critical digital infrastructure. Impact: Since critical libraries are often maintained by unpaid
    developers in their spare time, the ecosystem is fragile. Without financial support for these
    "human foundations," Europe risks burn-out among its top talent and increased security
    vulnerabilities in its supply chain.
â¢   Lack of IT Spending Transparency and Procurement Inventory: Most Member States lack a
    centralized, transparent inventory of IT assets, software licenses, and digital procurement
    spending. There is no unified "IT budget line" at the national level, meaning that even top
    government officials often do not know the total expenditure on proprietary software versus
    open solutions. Case Study & Impact: In Poland, it was only in 2025 that the SIST (System
    Inwentaryzacji SystemÃ³w Teleinformatycznych) gained proper legal standing to track and report
    IT systems and procurement. Previously, neither the Prime Minister nor the Ministry of Finance
    could accurately state the total national spend on IT.
â¢   Lack of Scale-up Funding and Competitive Challenges (The AI Gap): The EU lacks
    aggressive, open-competition funding models for scaling high-potential projects. Unlike Indiaâs
    "Bhashini" or other sovereign AI initiatives, Europe does not yet have enough large-scale, open
    challenges to build and scale foundational models (like LLMs) or core infrastructure. Impact:
    European OSS projects stay "small" or "academic." Without "winner-takes-most" style support

                                           Page 5 z 43
        for the best open-source projects, the EU will continue to lose the race in emerging fields like
        Generative AI to heavily subsidized or venture-backed foreign entities.
    â¢   The "Silo" Problem: This lack of inventory extends to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and
        local governments, where each entity procures hardware and software in isolation. This leads
        to:
            o   Duplication of costs: Paying for the same license multiple times across different
                departments.
            o   Inability to aggregate demand: Without a clear inventory, countries cannot use their
                "buyer power" to negotiate better terms or mandate Open Source alternatives.
            o   Strategic Blindness: It is impossible to manage a transition to technological
                sovereignty when the "as-is" state of dependency is not even measured.
    â¢   Fragmentation of the Ecosystem: The EU OSS landscape is characterized by small,
        scattered SMEs and individual contributors. It lacks the large "anchor tenants", a massive
        technology companies that, in the US or China (big tech), provide the funding, infrastructure,
        and full-time personnel to maintain critical open source projects.
    â¢   Infrastructure Dependency: European OSS development largely relies on non-EU
        infrastructure (e.g., GitHub/Microsoft, AWS, GitLab). This creates a paradox where the code is
        open, but the platforms hosting, building, and distributing it are controlled by external
        jurisdictions, posing a risk to sovereignty.
    â¢   Value capture outside Europe: A fundamental weakness is that much of the economic value
        generated by European open-source communities flows outside the EU, often benefiting large
        technology companies headquartered elsewhere. While European developers contribute
        substantially to the global digital commons (which underpins 70-90% of all code in the digital
        economy), commercialization and ecosystem monetization predominantly occur beyond EU
        borders.

1.2 Main Barriers to Adoption and Maintenance (i)
The following barriers hinder the widespread adoption of high-quality, secure OSS, particularly in the
public sector and critical industries:
    â¢   Procurement Inertia and Vendor Lock-in:
            o   Public procurement processes are historically designed for proprietary licensing models
                ("buying a box") rather than service-based models ("funding development/support").
            o   Legacy vendor lock-in creates high switching costs. Many public administrators
                perceive "nobody gets fired for buying [Dominant Proprietary Vendor]" as a safer route,
                despite the long-term strategic risk.
    â¢   The "Productization Gap" (Code vs. Product):
            o   There is a distinction between excellent code and an enterprise-ready product. Many
                EU OSS projects lack professional documentation, defined Service Level Agreements
                (SLAs), user-friendly interfaces, and legal indemnity.
            o   Without a business entity to provide liability guarantees (crucial under the new Cyber
                Resilience Act), risk-averse organizations hesitate to adopt community-run projects.
    â¢   The "Tragedy of the Commons" in Security Maintenance:

                                               Page 6 z 43
            o   Critical OSS infrastructure is often maintained by unpaid volunteers. There is a
                systemic lack of funding for maintenance (bug fixes, security patches, refactoring) as
                opposed to new features.
            o   This underfunding creates security vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4j scenario) which damages
                the reputation of OSS regarding safety and reliability.

1.3 Main Barriers to Sustainable Contribution (ii)
For the ecosystem to thrive, consumption must be balanced with contribution. Currently, the following
barriers prevent this cycle:
    â¢   The "Free-Rider" Problem:
            o   Large commercial entities often consume OSS components to build proprietary
                products without contributing back to the upstream projects (neither code nor funding).
                This extractive model exhausts maintainers and threatens project longevity.
    â¢   Lack of Organizational Maturity (OSPOs):
            o   Few European public bodies or traditional industries have established Open Source
                Program Offices (OSPOs). Without these dedicated units, organizations lack the legal
                policies, technical workflows, and cultural mandate to allow their employees to
                contribute code back to the community.
    â¢   Legal and Bureaucratic Uncertainty:
            o   In the public sector, contributing code developed with public funds is often hindered by
                unclear intellectual property (IP) regulations or fears of "state aid." There is a lack of a
                clear "Public Money, Public Code" default mechanism that legally mandates and
                simplifies the release of government-funded software.
    â¢   Misaligned Incentives in Funding:
            o   Grant systems often prioritize "novelty" over "sustainability." It is easier to get EU
                funding to write a new framework than to maintain and secure an existing widely-used
                library, discouraging long-term stewardship.

2 What is the added value of open source for the public and private
  sectors? Please provide concrete examples, including the factors
  (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation, among others) that
  are most important to assess the added value.
Open source software delivers substantial added value across both public and private sectors
through multiple interconnected dimensions: cost efficiency, strategic autonomy, security
transparency, innovation acceleration, and risk reduction. The value proposition varies by
context but consistently outweighs proprietary alternatives when assessed holistically.

2.1 Cost Savings and Economic Efficiency
    â¢   Direct license cost reduction: Open source eliminates recurring license fees that can
        consume 20-40% of public sector IT budgets. The City of Barcelona's migration to open
        source technologies aimed to redirect 70% of its software budget toward open source
        solutions by 2019, enabling reinvestment in local IT talent and custom development

                                               Page 7 z 43
       rather than vendor payments. Research shows that cost savings and faster
       development are the top beneï¬ts companies report from open source adoption.
   â¢   Avoided duplication and reuse efficiency: When public administrations share open
       source code, they eliminate redundant development efforts. A single solution can be
       deployed across multiple jurisdictions with customization, rather than each entity
       procuring bespoke systems. Studies on open data (a related concept) demonstrate that
       making research outputs openly available can save up to 9% of project costs by
       preventing unnecessary data collection and facilitating efficient reuse. Labour cost
       savings from data sharing and curation range from two to over twenty times the
       operational costs of maintaining shared repositories.
   â¢   Increased GDP and startup formation: Economic modeling indicates that a 10%
       increase in open source contributions could raise EU GDP by 0.4-0.6% and generate
       over 600 new startups, demonstrating macroeconomic value beyond individual project
       savings.

2.2 Freedom from Vendor Lock-in
   â¢   Reduced strategic dependency: Proprietary software creates dependency through
       data formats, APIs, and integration ecosystems that make switching costly or
       technically infeasible. Open source provides access to source code, enabling
       organizations to maintain, modify, and migrate systems independently. Organizations
       can self-host critical components or switch service providers without losing
       functionality, whereas proprietary solutions typically bind customers to single vendors
       through technical and contractual restrictions.
   â¢   Portability and multi-cloud ï¬exibility: Open source technologies like Kubernetes
       enable workloads to run across different cloud providers with minimal changes,
       supporting multi-cloud and hybrid strategies that prevent single-provider dependency.
       The World Bank notes that governments can "fast-track the delivery of services" using
       core open source systems as public goods, with value-added services developed
       independently by government or third parties since speciï¬cations and code are public.
   â¢   Concrete example: EUDI Wallet: The EU Digital Identity Wallet's Architecture
       Reference Framework (ARF) is developed as open source speciï¬cally to ensure
       interoperability, security, and privacy across all 27 Member States. This prevents any
       single vendor from controlling the European digital identity infrastructure and enables
       each country to implement solutions compatible with the shared framework while
       maintaining sovereignty over their systems.

2.3 Security and Transparency
   â¢   Supply chain visibility: Open source enables transparency in the software supply
       chain, allowing organizations to identify dependencies, audit code, and verify security
       properties. The EU's FOSSA (Free and Open Source Software Auditing) initiative has
       conducted security audits of open source projects used in EU technology
       infrastructure, identifying and correcting vulnerabilities that strengthen cybersecurity
       across Europe.
   â¢   Rapid vulnerability response: When security issues are discovered in open source
       software, the entire community can contribute to ï¬xes, and patches can be deployed

                                          Page 8 z 43
       without waiting for vendor release cycles. Organizations are not dependent on
       proprietary vendors' priorities or timelines for addressing critical vulnerabilities.
   â¢   Compliance with emerging regulation: The Cyber Resilience Act, AI Act, and
       Interoperable Europe Act emphasize openness, standards, and transparencyâ
       requirements naturally aligned with open source approaches. Open source facilitates
       compliance with Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) requirements and security baseline
       standards mandated by these frameworks.

2.4 Innovation and Interoperability

   â¢   Accelerated development cycles: Companies report faster development as a primary
       beneï¬t of open source because they can build on existing, tested components rather
       than developing from scratch. Investment in open source through programs like
       Horizon 2020 has stimulated innovation in key areas including artiï¬cial intelligence,
       cybersecurity, and cloud computing.
   â¢   Enhanced interoperability: Open source adoption has improved interoperability
       between systems across EU public administration, facilitating collaboration and data
       exchange between Member States. Open standards and open APIs reduce integration
       friction and enable ecosystem-wide compatibility that proprietary solutions typically
       obstruct through deliberate incompatibility.
   â¢   Community-driven improvement: The collaborative development model means that
       improvements and innovations contributed by any user beneï¬t the entire ecosystem.
       Public sector organizations can pool resources to enhance shared solutions rather than
       each paying vendors separately for similar feature requests.

2.5 Risk Mitigation

   â¢   Business continuity assurance: With access to source code, organizations are
       protected against vendor bankruptcy, acquisition, product discontinuation, or strategic
       pivots. If a commercial open source provider becomes unavailable, organizations can
       maintain systems independently or contract alternative service providers.
   â¢   Reduced procurement risk: Traditional procurement often goes over budget and over
       time. Open source solutions available as public goods reduce procurement complexity
       and provide replicability, allowing governments to avoid "reinventing the wheel" and
       reduce consultant procurement costs.
   â¢   Geopolitical resilience: Europe's reliance on external proprietary technology creates
       geopolitical vulnerabilities, as demonstrated when GitHub blocked developers in
       sanctioned countries from accessing repositories. European-funded open source
       components provide strategic autonomy and reduce exposure to externally imposed
       standards or access restrictions.

2.6 Concrete Implementation Examples

   â¢   Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund: since 2022, Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund has
       allocated over â¬24.6 million to support more than 60 open source projects globally,
       focusing on maintenance, security, and resilience of open digital base technologies.
       This model demonstrates public sector investment in critical infrastructure that

                                         Page 9 z 43
       beneï¬ts the entire ecosystem while maintaining security and transparency
       requirements.
   â¢   Estonia's X-Road: Estonia uses X-Road, an open source data exchange layer
       connecting public and private services across institutions. In 2024, Estonia released all
       state-developed software under open licenses, exemplifying "public money, public
       code" principles and enabling reuse by other nations.
   â¢   MOSIP Digital Identity: The Modular Open Source Identity Platform, developed in India
       and adopted in Morocco, the Philippines, and Ethiopia, demonstrates how fully open
       source platforms can be modular, adaptable, and deployed across diverse contexts
       without vendor lock-in.
   â¢   SIST (in Poland) - Implementing systems like SIST (2025) allows the state to inventory
       its IT assets. Using OSS for such inventories prevents the state from paying for
       redundant proprietary licenses across different ministries.
   â¢
   â¢   Barcelona's Digital Sovereignty Initiative
       Barcelona's comprehensive migration to open source aimed to help local IT talent by
       outsourcing to local SMEs and hiring 65 developers for custom needs, demonstrating
       how open source supports local economic development while reducing vendor
       dependency. The city joined the European "Public Money, Public Code" campaign,
       becoming a ï¬agship municipal example.

2.7 Assessment Framework

When evaluating open source value, the most important factors are:

   â¢   Total cost of ownership (not just initial licensing but long-term maintenance, exit costs,
       and opportunity costs of lock-in)
   â¢   Strategic autonomy (ability to control roadmap, maintain systems independently, and
       avoid dependency)
   â¢   Security and auditability (transparency of supply chain, speed of vulnerability response,
       compliance capability)
   â¢   Innovation velocity (speed of development, access to ecosystem improvements,
       interoperability enabling composition)
   â¢   Risk exposure (vendor continuity risk, geopolitical risk, procurement risk, technical
       debt from proprietary formats)

3 What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to
  support the development and growth of the EU open-source sector
  and contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and
  cybersecurity agenda?
3.1 Legislative and Policy Actions

   â¢   "Open Source First" in Public Procurement: Mandate that all EU-funded software
       projects (at the Commission and Member State level) default to Open Source. Any
       choice of proprietary software must require a "Sovereignty Impact Assessment"

                                         Page 10 z 43
    explaining why an open alternative was not viable. Amend EU public procurement
    directives (2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU) to establish an explicit "Open Source First"
    principle, requiring procurement authorities to default to open source solutions unless
    a suitable alternative is demonstrably unavailable with transparent justification. This
    aligns with the European Interoperability Framework's emphasis on open standards
    and interoperability as mandatory criteria. Procurement specifications must prohibit
    brand-name requirements and compatibility criteria that create de facto vendor lock-
    in. Instead, tenders should specify functional requirements, adherence to open
    standards (as defined by EIF), and interoperability obligations that enable multi-vendor
    competition.
â¢   Mandatory Software Bill of Materials (SBOM): Leverage the Cyber Resilience Act
    (CRA) to require all software vendors selling to the EU public sector to provide a
    machine-readable SBOM. This increases transparency and rewards OSS projects that
    already follow high security standards.
         o Extend SBOM into a mandatory AI Model Bill of Materials (MBOM) for AI
             systems procured/deployed by public sector: training data provenance
             summary, evaluation/benchmark results, known limitations, update policy, and
             deployment constraints â auto-generated via open tools.
         o comment: This standardizes trust without forcing startups into bespoke
             legal/technical documentation per customer.
         o justification: Itâs the AI equivalent of an âingredients labelâ â makes
             procurement and audits faster.
â¢   Establishment of a European OSPO Network (EN-OSPO): Create a formal
    coordination body for Open Source Program Offices across Member States. This
    network would harmonize licensing, security audits, and contribution policies, ensuring
    that a developer in Poland and a developer in France can easily collaborate on a
    "European Tech Stack." Strengthen and formalize the EU OSPO Network, which
    currently connects 13 organizations across 8 Member States to share best practices
    on open source strategy and implementation. Each Member State should establish a
    national-level Open Source Programme Office with dedicated staff, budget, and
    ministerial-level reporting to coordinate policy, procurement, and capacity building.
    The Commission's OSPO, established in November 2020, should serve as the
    coordination hub providing: standardized governance frameworks and templates;
    training and certification programs for public sector open source managers; shared
    legal and licensing guidance; and regular policy alignment conveying among national
    OSPOs. This network should explicitly support the transition from isolated pilots to
    shared, scalable infrastructure.
â¢   Mandate "Public Money, Public Code" Across EU Institutions - Establish EU-wide
    regulation requiring that software developed with public funding be released under
    open source licenses by default, with narrow and transparent exceptions. This should
    apply to: all EU-funded research and innovation projects; software commissioned by
    national, regional, and local administrations; and digital public services and platforms.
    Estonia's 2024 policy to release all state-developed software under open licenses
    provides a concrete model. Member States should be required to publish code in
    accessible public repositories (ideally on European-hosted infrastructure) with
    appropriate documentation, rather than simply making code "available on request"

                                      Page 11 z 43
   â¢   Extend the existing âPublic Money, Public Codeâ principle to explicitly cover AI
       models, training datasets, and training methodologies developed with EU or
       Member State public funding. - By default, AI model weights (where legally and
       technically feasible), datasets, evaluation benchmarks, and training recipes should be
       released under approved open licenses, with narrow, well-justified exceptions.
       Code, models, and data should be published in accessible European repositories with
       minimum documentation and reuse standards to ensure practical uptake.
            o Comment: At present, large volumes of publicly funded AI outputs remain
                inaccessible or unusable beyond the original project, resulting in duplication
                and wasted public investment. This situation unintentionally turns EU-funded
                research and pilots into free upstream inputs for non-EU proprietary
                platforms, while European startups cannot legally reuse them. Without
                extending âPublic Money, Public Codeâ to AI-specific assets, Europe will
                continue to fund innovation without capturing long-term strategic or economic
                value.
            o Justification: If taxpayers finance the development of AI models and datasets,
                Europe should be able to reuse, adapt, and scale them across borders and
                sectors.
                Open access to publicly funded AI assets dramatically lowers entry barriers for
                startups, shortens development cycles, and accelerates deployment in
                industry and public services. In simple terms, this policy turns public AI
                spending into shared European infrastructure, rather than one-off projects
                with limited downstream impact.
   â¢   Address Legal Uncertainty and Licensing Concerns - Provide clear guidance on
       intellectual property, licensing, and liability frameworks for public sector open source
       participation, addressing the concerns that 31% of organizations cite legal issues and
       24% fear IP leakage as barriers to contribution. Establish safe harbors for public
       employees contributing to open source projects within their official duties, clarifying
       that such contributions do not create personal liability or unauthorized transfer of
       government IP.
   â¢   Expand the EU-FOSSA (Free and Open Source Software Auditing) framework and
       bug bounty programs, which currently operate under a four-year â¬7.7 million contract
       with YesWeHack. The scope should cover all open source components identified as
       critical dependencies for EU institutions and Member State infrastructure, not just
       Commission-deployed software. Establish a continuous security assessment pipeline
       with dedicated resources for prompt remediation, recognizing that identifying
       vulnerabilities without funding fixes creates technical debt.

3.2 Financial and Structural Support

   â¢   Establish a "European Sovereign Tech Fund" (ESTF): Modelled after Germanyâs
       successful Sovereign Tech Fund, the EU should provide direct, long-term funding for
       the maintenance of critical OSS libraries. This is not for "innovation" but for "digital
       roadworks"âfixing bugs, improving security, and ensuring the stability of the
       infrastructure that the EU economy relies on. Create a dedicated EU Sovereign Tech
       Fund with a minimum budget of â¬350 million over seven years, modeled on Germany's
       successful Sovereign Tech Fund which has allocated â¬24.6 million to over 60 critical

                                         Page 12 z 43
       open source projects. Unlike traditional research funding, this fund should prioritize
       maintenance, security hardening, and ecosystem resilience rather than innovation
       prototypes. The fund should support infrastructure-layer technologies that are difficult
       to monetize commercially but provide essential underpinning for digital services
       across public and private sectors.
   â¢   Open Source "Scale-up" Vouchers: Create a dedicated funding stream within the EIC
       (European Innovation Council) specifically for OSS startups to "productize" their
       code (e.g., funding for documentation, UI/UX, legal compliance, and marketing) to
       cross the "valley of death."
   â¢   Incentivizing Private Contribution: Provide tax incentives or R&D credits for EU
       companies that allow their employees to contribute back to upstream OSS projects
       during working hours. This addresses the "free-rider" problem and strengthens the
       "human infrastructure."
   â¢   Expand and Reorient Horizon Europe and Digital Europe Programme: Redirect
       significant portions of Horizon Europe and Digital Europe Programme funding from
       early-stage prototypes toward "valley of death" bridgingâindustrialization,
       certification readiness, market integration support, and long-term maintenance of
       successful projects. The Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative has successfully
       funded grassroots open source across all Internet layers from hardware to
       applications, but needs enhanced pathways to scale proven solutions into production
       deployment. Create dedicated funding lines for: security audits and vulnerability
       remediation; SBOM generation and supply chain tooling; interoperability testing and
       certification support; community governance capacity building; and documentation
       and localization to support cross-border adoption.

3.3 Infrastructure and Capacity Building

   â¢   Sovereign Hosting & Development Infrastructure: Invest in a European Federated
       Code Repository (a sovereign alternative to GitHub). This platform should be hosted
       on Gaia-X compliant infrastructure within the EU to ensure that European code, CI/CD
       pipelines, and developer data are protected from extra-territorial jurisdictions.
   â¢   "Grand Challenges" for Open AI and Hardware: Launch massive, mission-oriented
       competitions for open-source foundational models (LLMs) and open hardware (RISC-
       V). Like Indiaâs "Bhashini" initiative, the EU should fund the creation of datasets and
       models that are released as Digital Commons.
   â¢   Leverage the Digital Commons EDIC as Implementation Vehicle - The Digital
       Commons European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (DC EDIC), launched in
       December 2025 with France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy as founding
       members, provides the legal and governance framework to pool resources across
       Member States for strategic open source components. The Commission should
       position DC EDIC as the primary vehicle for: multi-country co-investment in shared
       digital building blocks; long-term governance and maintenance of common platforms;
       provision of technical and legal expertise as "one-stop shop"; and creating clear
       pathways from research projects (like Digital Europe Programme outputs) to
       European-wide deployment. Additional Member States (Luxembourg, Slovenia) are
       joining, with Poland and Belgium as observers, demonstrating momentum that should
       be accelerated through dedicated Commission support and co-funding.

                                         Page 13 z 43
   â¢   Facilitate Multi-Country Code Collaboration Mechanisms - Build on pioneer
       initiatives like the EUDI Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) and Digital
       Commons EDIC to create systematic frameworks for cross-border code collaboration.
       Establish: templates for multi-country governance and intellectual property sharing;
       co-funding mechanisms allowing Member States to pool resources on shared
       components; and technical infrastructure for collaborative development with
       appropriate access control and accountability.

3.4 Education and Talent

   â¢   Erasmus for OSS Contributors: Establish a fellowship program for young European
       developers to work full-time on critical OSS projects for 6-12 months, fostering a new
       generation of "Sovereignty Engineers."
   â¢   Educational Reform: Integrate "Open Source Literacy" into the European Digital
       Competence Framework (DigComp). Move away from vendor-specific certifications
       in schools toward neutral, open-standard skills.
   â¢   Create Open Source Competence Centers and Training Programs - Establish
       regional competence centers providing: technical assistance for public
       administrations adopting open source; governance and community management
       training; security assessment and hardening services; and integration and
       customization support. These centers should bridge the gap between community-
       driven projects and enterprise deployment requirements that administrations demand.
   â¢   Integrate open source software, licensing, and community participation into
       formal education curricula from secondary through university levels, replacing the
       current practice where educational institutions standardize on proprietary suites
       (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace) that create lifetime dependency.

3.5 Solutions to the weaknesses described in Chapter 1
3.5.1 The "Valley of Death" in Commercialization

Problem: Europe excels at funding research but fails to support the critical transition from
open source projects to viable commercial products and scale-ups, leading to value capture
by non-EU entities.

Solutions:

   â¢   Create a dedicated Open Source Scale-Up Fund
       Establish a â¬500 million "Open Source to Market" fund explicitly targeting the
       commercialization phase, separate from Horizon Europe's research focus. This fund
       should provide: growth capital (â¬2-10 million tranches) for proven open source
       projects with clear European strategic value; go-to-market support including business
       model development, sales enablement, and channel partnerships; regulatory
       compliance assistance (certifications, SBOM generation, security audits); and
       technical product management to transform community code into enterprise-ready
       solutions.
   â¢   Establish Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) with "Anchor Customer"
       Commitments

                                         Page 14 z 43
       Structure PPPs where EU institutions and Member States commit to multi-year
       procurement contracts for promising European open source solutions, providing
       revenue certainty that attracts private co-investment. The Digital Commons EDIC
       should serve as the coordinating vehicle, with Member States pre-committing budget
       for shared solutions in strategic domains (identity, secure communication, cloud
       infrastructure).
   â¢   Link EU Investment Funds to Open Source Criteria
       Require that InvestEU, European Investment Bank (EIB), and national development
       banks include open source investment criteria in their technology portfolios. Create
       specific investment vehicles for open source business models (dual-licensing, open-
       core, services, support) with risk assessment frameworks adapted to these models
       rather than traditional SaaS metrics.
   â¢   Foster European Tech Giants as "Anchor Tenants"
       Incentivize large European corporations (Siemens, SAP, Bosch, Ericsson, Dassault
       SystÃ¨mes) to establish or expand open source divisions with dedicated maintainer
       teams for strategic components, similar to how US tech giants employ thousands of
       open source developers. Provide tax incentives or procurement preferences for
       companies that employ full-time open source maintainers and contribute strategically
       important code under permissive licenses.

3.5.2 Lack of Strategic Maturity and the OSPO Gap

Problem: 66% of European organizations lack formal open source strategy; 78% have no
OSPO, hampering systematic engagement with open source ecosystems.

Solutions

   â¢   Mandate OSPOs in All Public Sector Entities Above Threshold Size
       Require that all EU institutions, national ministries, regional governments above 5
       million population, and SOEs with >500 employees establish a formal Open Source
       Program Office with dedicated staff and budget. Define minimum OSPO functions:
       internal policy development and compliance; community engagement and contribution
       governance; procurement guidance and vendor evaluation; security monitoring and
       vulnerability management; and training and capacity building.
   â¢   Strengthen the EU OSPO Network as Coordination Hub
       Expand the EU OSPO Network beyond its current 13 organizations across 8 Member
       States to include all 27 Member States plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland. The
       Commission's OSPO should provide: standardized OSPO maturity models and self-
       assessment tools; comprehensive training programs and certification for OSPO
       professionals; template policies, governance frameworks, and legal guidance; and
       quarterly coordination meetings with published action plans and accountability
       metrics.
   â¢   Integrate OSPO Requirements into EU Digital Decade Targets
       Make OSPO establishment and open source adoption measurable indicators within
       the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030, similar to how 5G coverage and digital
       skills are tracked. Member States should report annually on: number and capacity of
       OSPOs established; percentage of public sector software procurement that is open

                                       Page 15 z 43
       source; code published under "Public Money, Public Code" principles; and full-time
       equivalent (FTE) developers employed in open source maintenance.
   â¢   Provide EU Co-Funding for National OSPO Establishment
       Allocate â¬50 million through the Digital Europe Programme for 50% matched funding
       to Member States establishing national OSPOs, with additional support for training,
       tooling, and first-year operating costs. Tie funding to delivery milestones: published
       national open source strategy; operational OSPO with minimum 5 FTE staff; first code
       releases to public repositories; and first cross-border collaboration initiated.

3.5.3 Absence of "Public Money, Public Code" Mandate

Problem: No legal obligation for public sector to release publicly funded software, resulting in
massive code duplication and wasted taxpayer money.

Solutions

   â¢   Adopt EU-Wide "Public Money, Public Code" Regulation
       Enact binding EU regulation requiring that all software developed with public funds
       (EU, national, regional, local) be released under approved open source licenses (EUPL,
       GPL, MIT, Apache 2.0) by default. Model on Estonia's 2024 policy releasing all state
       software under open licenses. Permit narrow exceptions only for: genuine national
       security concerns (requiring ministerial approval and public justification); pre-existing
       third-party IP (which should be minimized through procurement terms); and temporary
       delays (maximum 12 months) for security hardening before publication.
   â¢   Create European Public Code Repository Infrastructure
       Establish an official EU public code registry (building on the Open Source Observatory
       and Joinup platforms) where all publicly funded software must be published with
       standardized metadata: functional description and use cases; license and contribution
       guidelines; security attestation and SBOM; deployment documentation and
       dependencies; and contact points for reuse support. Provide automated ingestion from
       national repositories and GitHub/GitLab, with quality gates ensuring minimum
       documentation standards.
   â¢   Make Code Publication a Condition for EU Funding
       Amend Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme, and all relevant funding
       instruments to make open source publication a mandatory deliverable, with final
       payments contingent on code release. Include code quality metrics (documentation,
       test coverage, security scan results) as evaluation criteria, not just publication.
   â¢   Implement Progressive Enforcement with Transition Support
       Phase in requirements over 24 months: Year 1 (2026-2027): All new procurement
       contracts must include open source publication clauses; existing systems must
       conduct IP audits to identify publishable components. Year 2 (2027-2028): 50% of
       new development published within 6 months of completion; publication tracking
       systems operational in all Member States. Year 3+ (2028+): Full enforcement with
       financial penalties for non-compliance; annual public reporting of code publication
       volumes.

                                          Page 16 z 43
   â¢   Provide dedicated technical assistance and legal support for administrations
       transitioning to open publication, addressing IP concerns and contract negotiation with
       suppliers resistant to openness.

3.5.4 Fragmented Collaboration: The "Snowdrop" Syndrome

Problem: Cross-border code collaboration remains exceptional rather than systematic; 27
Member States procure duplicate solutions instead of building shared infrastructure.

Solutions

   â¢   Scale the Digital Commons EDIC as Primary Collaboration Vehicle
       Accelerate Digital Commons EDIC membership to all 27 Member States by end of
       2026, transforming it from 4 founding members (France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy)
       to the standard mechanism for multi-country digital infrastructure. Provide EDIC with:
       â¬200 million annual operating budget from Commission and Member State
       contributions; legal templates for IP sharing, governance, and cost allocation across
       countries; technical infrastructure for collaborative development (repositories, CI/CD,
       security scanning); and dedicated program management for priority use cases.
   â¢   Identify and Prioritize 10 "European Tech Stack" Components
       Through the EDIC, jointly select and commit to 10 foundational components for
       mandatory cross-border collaboration based on strategic importance and duplication
       cost: digital identity and authentication (building on EUDI Wallet ARF); secure
       messaging and collaboration platforms; document management and case workflow
       systems; geospatial services and address registries; payment and invoice processing
       infrastructure; AI/ML infrastructure (model registry, training platforms, inference);
       cybersecurity tooling (SIEM, threat intelligence, incident response); cloud
       orchestration and FinOps tooling; open data platforms and API management; and e-
       procurement and public tender systems.
   â¢   For each component, establish: lead Member State(s) with existing capability; co-
       funding formula based on population and GDP; governance board with technical and
       policy representation; and 3-year roadmap with deliverables and KPIs.
   â¢   Create "Coalitions of the Willing" Framework
       Not all initiatives require all 27 Member States simultaneously. Establish streamlined
       processes for subsets of countries to collaborate on shared code with explicit
       pathways for others to join later. Use enhanced cooperation mechanisms under EU
       treaties to enable groups of at least 9 Member States to proceed with shared
       development funded through Digital Europe Programme or Connecting Europe Facility.
   â¢   Mandate Interoperability and Reusability Assessments
       Before any Member State or EU institution procures or develops new software above
       â¬1 million, require a mandatory "check first" assessment: Are existing open source
       solutions available in other Member States? Can requirements be met by
       extending/customizing existing European code? Would other countries benefit from a
       shared solution? If proceeding alone, must commit to developing as open source for
       future reuse.

                                        Page 17 z 43
3.5.5 Procurement Bias and the "Brand Name" Trap

Problem: Public procurement systematically excludes open source through brand-name
specifications (e.g., "Microsoft 365" in Polish tenders) and evaluation criteria favoring
proprietary incumbents.

Solutions

   â¢   Prohibit Brand-Name Specifications in EU Public Procurement
       Amend EU Procurement Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU to explicitly prohibit
       specifications that name proprietary products or create de facto brand requirements
       through compatibility criteria. Violations should trigger: automatic tender nullification
       upon challenge; financial penalties for contracting authorities; and personal liability for
       procurement officers approving non-compliant tenders.
   â¢   Following the Polish Instrat Foundation 2025 report highlighting systematic
       Microsoft/Google brand specifications, mandate procurement transparency: all
       tenders above â¬100,000 must be published in machine-readable format with
       automated compliance checking for brand-name violations.
   â¢   Implement "Open Source First" as Binding Principle
       Establish legal presumption favoring open source: contracting authorities must
       evaluate open source alternatives first and document reasons if selecting proprietary
       solutions. Create three-tier justification requirements: Tier 1 (<â¬500k): Simple
       declaration that open source was considered; Tier 2 (â¬500k-â¬5M): Detailed technical
       comparison showing open source inadequacy; Tier 3 (>â¬5M): Independent technical
       review and ministerial approval for proprietary selection.
   â¢   Publish annual "proprietary procurement registers" naming authorities that repeatedly
       select proprietary solutions, creating transparency and accountability.
   â¢   Develop Standardized Open Source Evaluation Frameworks
       Create EU-wide evaluation criteria specifically designed for open source that replace
       traditional vendor-focused metrics: Replace "vendor financial stability" with
       "community health metrics" (contributor diversity, commit frequency, issue resolution
       time). Replace "vendor support SLAs" with "ecosystem maturity" (availability of
       multiple service providers, documentation quality, user base size). Replace
       "proprietary certifications" with "security posture" (audit history, vulnerability
       disclosure practices, SBOM quality). Replace "single-vendor solution" with
       "interoperability and portability" (adherence to open standards, migration cost
       assessment).
   â¢   The European Commission should publish reference evaluation matrices for common
       procurement categories (office suites, cloud infrastructure, identity management,
       collaboration tools) with mandatory minimum weights for openness criteria.
   â¢   Establish EU Framework Agreements for Open Source Services
       Create pre-competed framework agreements for support, customization, integration,
       and maintenance services around major open source platforms (LibreOffice,
       Nextcloud, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, etc.). Member States and institutions can call off
       these frameworks without new tenders, dramatically reducing procurement friction
       and creating sustainable revenue for European service providers.

                                          Page 18 z 43
   â¢   Framework providers must commit to upstream contribution (minimum 20% of
       development effort contributed back to community projects) ensuring that public
       procurement strengthens rather than fragments the ecosystem.

3.5.6 Educational Dependency: The "Classroom-to-Cloud" Pipeline

Problem: Schools standardize on Microsoft 365/Google Workspace, creating lifelong vendor
lock-in and failing to teach open source principles.

Solutions

   â¢   Mandate Open Source Options in Educational Procurement
       Require that all educational institution procurement for digital learning platforms
       includes at least one evaluated open source alternative (Moodle, Nextcloud,
       LibreOffice, ONLYOFFICE). Make cost-benefit analyses mandatory that include: total
       lifecycle costs including data egress and vendor switching costs; data sovereignty and
       privacy implications under GDPR; pedagogical impact on teaching transferable vs.
       vendor-specific skills; and long-term dependency risks and exit costs.
   â¢   Procurement selecting proprietary platforms must demonstrate superior pedagogical
       outcomes, not just administrative convenience.
   â¢   Create "Digital Sovereignty" Curriculum Requirements
       Integrate open source principles, open standards, and digital commons concepts into
       mandatory ICT curricula at secondary and university levels across all Member States.
       Students should learn: fundamental concepts (licensing, collaboration models,
       version control, community governance); practical skills (contributing to open projects,
       using open development tools); and critical thinking about technology sovereignty,
       vendor dependency, and digital rights.
   â¢   Certify that graduation requirements include demonstrable open source contribution
       (bug fix, documentation, translation, etc.) for ICT-focused programs.
   â¢   Fund "Open Source in Education" Infrastructure and Support
       Allocate â¬100 million through Erasmus+ Digital and Creative Europe for: development
       of open educational resources (OER) and teaching materials about open source;
       training programs for teachers on open platforms and pedagogical approaches;
       technical support infrastructure helping schools deploy and maintain open solutions
       (Nextcloud, Moodle, LibreOffice, Jitsi); and student competitions and hackathons
       focused on contributing to European open source projects.
   â¢   Showcase Success Stories and Create Peer Pressure
       The Commission should publish annual rankings of Member States by "educational
       open source adoption rate" with case studies from leaders, creating competitive
       dynamics and knowledge sharing. Highlight cost savings and pedagogical benefits
       achieved by pioneering regions (Barcelona's model of using open source to support
       local IT talent).

3.5.7 Chronic Underfunding of Volunteer Infrastructure

Problem: Critical open source infrastructure maintained by unpaid volunteers without
sustainable support, creating security vulnerabilities and burnout.

                                         Page 19 z 43
Solutions

   â¢   Establish EU Maintainer Fellowship Program
       Create a â¬50 million annual "European Open Source Maintainer Fellowship" providing
       direct financial support (â¬60-100k/year) to individual maintainers of critical
       infrastructure. Selection criteria: components identified as critical dependencies in
       European public infrastructure; active maintenance with demonstrated community
       impact; maintainer commitment to security best practices and timely vulnerability
       response; and willingness to mentor new contributors. Start with 100 fellowships in
       Year 1, scaling to 500 by Year 3, modeled on Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund
       approach.
   â¢   Fund Community Infrastructure and Governance
       Beyond individual maintainers, support the organizational infrastructure of open
       source communities: governance development (transition from BDFL to foundation
       models, conflict resolution, decision processes); community moderation and code of
       conduct enforcement; documentation, localization, and accessibility improvements;
       and contributor onboarding programs and mentorship.Provide grants of â¬50-200k to
       established communities (Apache Foundation, Linux Foundation, Eclipse Foundation,
       FSFE) specifically for European community health and governance capacity building.
   â¢   Create "Maintenance Bonds" in Procurement
       When public sector entities use open source components, require that 5-10% of the IT
       budget be allocated to maintenance bonds supporting upstream projects. These funds
       flow to foundations or directly to maintainers through transparent allocation
       mechanisms based on dependency analysis (which components are actually used and
       how critical they are). This creates sustainable, usage-based funding rather than one-
       time grants, aligning incentives between users and maintainers.
   â¢   Recognize Open Source Contribution in Career Frameworks
       Establish that open source contributions count formally toward: career progression in
       public sector ICT roles (similar to academic publications); university tenure and
       promotion decisions for computer science faculty; and professional certification and
       continuing education requirements for software engineers. Create a European "Open
       Source Contributor Registry" where contributions are verified and can be referenced in
       job applications, procurement bids, and funding applications, solving the "invisible
       labor" problem.

3.5.8 Lack of IT Spending Transparency and Procurement Inventory

Problem: No centralized visibility into national IT spending, software licenses, or vendor
dependencies, preventing strategic planning and buyer power aggregation.

Solutions

   â¢   Mandate National IT Asset and Spending Registries
       Require all Member States to establish and maintain comprehensive, real-time IT
       asset registries covering: all software licenses and subscriptions (proprietary and open
       source support contracts); hardware infrastructure and cloud consumption; vendor
       relationships and contract terms (including lock-in clauses); and total cost of

                                          Page 20 z 43
       ownership and renewal schedules. Build on Poland's SIST (System Inwentaryzacji
       SystemÃ³w Teleinformatycznych) model, which gained legal standing in 2025 after
       years of limited visibility. Provide EU technical assistance and reference architecture
       for countries without existing systems.
   â¢   Create EU-Wide IT Spending Dashboard
       Aggregate national registries into an EU-level dashboard (anonymized/aggregated for
       sensitive details) showing: total public sector spending on proprietary vs. open source
       software across EU; market concentration (percentage of budget going to top 5
       vendors); dependency hotspots (single-vendor dependencies affecting multiple
       Member States); and procurement efficiency (cost variations for similar solutions
       across countries). Publish annually as part of Digital Decade reporting, creating
       political visibility and accountability.
   â¢   Implement Federated Procurement Intelligence
       Use registry data to enable coordinated procurement strategies: identify common
       needs across multiple Member States for joint procurement; detect opportunities to
       aggregate demand for better negotiating position; reveal duplication where countries
       are paying separately for identical solutions; and inform prioritization for European
       alternative development (where spending on external vendors is highest). The Digital
       Commons EDIC should operate a "procurement intelligence unit" providing Member
       States with strategic analysis and negotiation support.
   â¢   Extend Transparency to State-Owned Enterprises
       SOEs often represent massive IT spending outside government direct control. Mandate
       that all SOEs above 500 employees report IT assets and spending to national registries
       with same detail as government departments. This is particularly critical in sectors like
       energy, transport, and telecommunications where SOEs operate critical infrastructure.
       Make registry reporting a condition for SOEs accessing state subsidies, guarantees, or
       preferential procurement.

3.5.9 Lack of Scale-Up Funding and Competitive Challenges (The AI Gap)

Problem: Europe lacks aggressive, open-competition funding models for scaling high-
potential projects, particularly in strategic areas like AI where India and others are advancing
rapidly.

Solutions

   â¢   Launch "European Open Source Grand Challenges"
       Create â¬200 million annual "Grand Challenge" program modeled on DARPA and
       India's sovereign AI initiatives, with open competitions for: foundational open AI
       models (multilingual LLMs competitive with GPT/Claude); European AI infrastructure
       (training platforms, model registries, inference optimization); cybersecurity critical
       components (quantum-safe cryptography, supply chain security tools); sovereign
       cloud platforms (alternatives to hyperscalers with European data residency); and
       industrial digitalization platforms (automotive software stacks, smart manufacturing
       middleware). Structure as milestone-based funding: Initial grants (â¬500k-2M) for proof
       of concept awarded to 10-20 teams per challenge. Scale-up funding (â¬5-20M) for top

                                          Page 21 z 43
    3 performers achieving technical milestones. Production deployment support (â¬20-
    50M) for winner with clear path to European-wide adoption.
â¢   Prioritize Open Models in AI Act Implementation
    As the AI Act enters force, provide regulatory advantages and funding preferences for
    open source AI: faster conformity assessment for open models with transparent
    training data and architecture; reduced compliance burden (documentation
    requirements partially satisfied by code transparency); public procurement
    preferences for open models in public sector AI deployments; and innovation sandbox
    access and technical support from AI Office for open source developers. Commission
    should fund development of open reference implementations for high-risk AI systems,
    demonstrating compliance pathways and reducing barriers.
        o Introduce a formal, legally binding fast-track compliance pathway under the
            AI Act for open, auditable AI models, including GPAI where applicable.
        o This fast-track should be available to AI systems that meet clearly defined
            criteria of technical transparency and auditability, such as:
                ï§ availability of model architecture and/or weights where feasible,
                ï§ documented training data provenance and evaluation methodology,
                ï§ open or inspectable interfaces enabling independent testing,
                ï§ published update and risk-mitigation policies.
        o For eligible models, compliance obligations should be simplified and
            standardized, replacing bespoke, narrative-heavy documentation with:
                ï§ EU-level templates and checklists,
                ï§ self-assessment declarations validated ex post,
                ï§ randomized or risk-based audits instead of universal ex-ante
                     conformity assessments.
        o In addition, open-model developers qualifying for the fast-track should receive
            priority access to regulatory sandboxes, technical guidance from the EU AI
            Office, and pre-validated compliance tooling.
â¢   Create European AI Commons Infrastructure
    Invest â¬500 million in shared infrastructure specifically for European AI open source
    ecosystem: compute resources (GPU/TPU clusters accessible to researchers and
    startups for training); model registries and versioning (European-hosted MLOps
    infrastructure); datasets and benchmarks (multilingual, culturally diverse European
    datasets under clear licenses); and evaluation and safety testing infrastructure (red-
    teaming, bias testing, performance benchmarking). Operate through EuroHPC Joint
    Undertaking, extending existing supercomputing infrastructure specifically for open AI
    development.
â¢   Establish "Open Source Unicorn" Target
    Set explicit policy goal of creating 10 European open source "unicorns" (â¬1B+
    valuation) by 2030 in strategic sectors, with dedicated support including: venture
    capital co-investment (EU matching private funding 1:1 for open source business
    models); procurement guarantees (multi-year contracts providing revenue certainty);
    technical partnership with research institutions and existing players; and talent access
    (simplified visa and hiring processes for critical roles). Track progress publicly as part
    of Digital Decade targets, creating accountability and visibility.

3.5.10 Fragmentation of the Ecosystem and Lack of "Anchor Tenants"

Problem: European open source landscape dominated by small, scattered SMEs and
individuals, lacking large corporate anchor tenants that fund critical maintenance like US tech
giants.

Solutions

   â¢   Incentivize Corporate Open Source Investment
       Create tax incentives (R&D tax credits, accelerated depreciation) specifically for:
       employing full-time open source maintainers contributing to strategic European
       projects; operating open source program offices with upstream contribution
       mandates; sponsoring open source foundations and community infrastructure; and
       releasing internal tools as open source under permissive licenses. Target European
       industrial champions (Siemens, Bosch, SAP, Ericsson, Schneider Electric, Thales) with
       specific open source contribution targets tied to public sector contracts and EU
       funding eligibility.
   â¢   Create "Open Source Obligations" in State Aid and Public Contracts
       Make meaningful open source contribution a condition for: companies receiving state
       aid or industrial subsidies above â¬10M; vendors winning public contracts above â¬20M
       (minimum 10% of contract value dedicated to upstream open source contribution);
       and participation in EU funding programs (Chips JU, KDT JU, Digital Europe
       Programme). This creates systematic demand for corporate open source investment
       rather than relying on voluntary goodwill.
   â¢   Foster European Open Source Consortia
       Support formation of industry consortia co-investing in shared open source
       infrastructure within sectors: automotive (software-defined vehicle platforms,
       AUTOSAR alternatives); telecommunications (Open RAN, core network components);
       manufacturing (Industry 4.0 middleware, digital twin platforms); and finance (payment
       infrastructure, regulatory compliance tools). Provide EU co-funding (50% matched by
       industry) and antitrust safe harbors for collaborative development, modeled on
       successful consortia like Linux Foundation projects.
   â¢   Attract Global Anchor Tenants with European Operations
       While building European champions, pragmatically engage non-EU tech companies
       with significant European presence (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta) by: requiring
       substantial European open source investment as condition for operating data centers
       in EU; mandating that European R&D centers contribute to European open source
       priorities; and creating incentives to establish European open source foundations with
       genuine EU governance. Make clear that market access depends on strengthening, not
       extracting from, European digital infrastructure.

3.5.11 Infrastructure Dependency

Problem: European open source development relies on non-EU infrastructure
(GitHub/Microsoft, AWS, GitLab), creating sovereignty risks even when code is open.

Solutions

                                         Page 23 z 43
   â¢   Build European Open Source Infrastructure Stack
       Invest â¬300 million in comprehensive European-hosted infrastructure for the open
       source lifecycle: source code management (European-hosted GitLab/Gitea instances
       with federation to GitHub); artifact registries (container, package, and binary
       repositories for all major ecosystems); CI/CD platforms (scalable build and test
       infrastructure with European compliance); security scanning and SBOM generation
       (integrated vulnerability analysis and supply chain tooling); and code signing and
       attestation (trusted infrastructure for release verification). Operate under transparent,
       multi-stakeholder governance (public sector, foundations, private providers) ensuring
       both sovereignty and interoperability with global platforms.
   â¢   Establish "Code.Europa.EU" as Central Discovery Platform
       Create authoritative European registry for open source projects that integrates with but
       is independent of GitHub/GitLab: federated identity (single sign-on across European
       open source infrastructure); project discovery (searchable metadata, reuse guidelines,
       security attestations); contribution pathways (clear instructions for getting involved,
       governance information); and compliance tooling (license checking, security scanning,
       SBOM generation as free services). Build on existing Joinup and OSOR platforms,
       upgrading to modern, developer-friendly UX.
   â¢   Fund "Mirror and Migrate" Resilience Program
       Provide funding for systematic mirroring of critical European open source projects from
       external platforms to European infrastructure: automated synchronization maintaining
       GitHub/GitLab as primary while ensuring European copies; documented migration
       procedures for rapid switch if external platforms become unavailable; and regular
       testing of migration pathways (annual exercises simulating platform loss). This
       provides resilience without forcing immediate, disruptive migration from established
       platforms where communities already exist.
   â¢   Require European Infrastructure for Public Sector Code
       New "Public Money, Public Code" regulation should mandate that code developed
       with public funds be published on European infrastructure, with mirroring to
       GitHub/GitLab permitted but not required. This ensures that public code remains
       accessible regardless of external platform policies or geopolitical tensions.

3.5.12 Value Capture Outside Europe

Problem: Economic value from European open source development is predominantly
captured by non-EU companies through commercialization, services, and cloud hosting.

Solutions

   â¢   Implement "Right to European Value Capture" Framework
       Create policy framework ensuring that when European open source is
       commercialized, Europeans benefit proportionally: public procurement preferences
       for European service providers supporting European open source projects;
       requirement that major open source cloud services (managed Kubernetes, databases,
       AI platforms) offered in EU include European service provider options; and revenue
       sharing or contribution requirements for non-EU companies commercializing EU-

                                         Page 24 z 43
       funded open source (minimum 20% of EU revenue reinvested in European
       development).
   â¢   Build European Open Source Services Sector
       Dedicate â¬100 million to developing competitive European services companies around
       strategic open source: training and certification programs creating qualified workforce;
       sales and marketing support helping European SMEs compete for enterprise contracts;
       partnership facilitation connecting service providers with users and technology
       vendors; and quality certification (European open source service provider standards
       ensuring professional delivery). Target creation of 50 European companies with >50
       employees each providing enterprise-grade open source services by 2028.
   â¢   Mandate Upstream Contribution in Commercial Use
       When companies (EU or non-EU) commercialize open source in European market,
       require meaningful upstream contribution: for cloud services built on open source
       (managed PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, etc.): 10% of engineering effort contributed
       upstream; for products embedding open source components: security improvements
       and bug fixes contributed back; for AI models trained on open data/code: model
       weights and training approaches released under open licenses. Enforce through
       combination of procurement requirements (for public sector) and potential regulatory
       obligations (for private sector commercial use above revenue thresholds).
   â¢   Create European Open Source Venture Capital
       Establish â¬200 million European Open Source Venture Fund (within InvestEU
       framework) specifically backing European open source business models: investment
       criteria adapted to open source economics (community health, downstream adoption,
       contribution velocity vs. traditional SaaS metrics); patient capital with longer time
       horizons recognizing open source value creation patterns; and strategic guidance
       connecting portfolio companies with public sector customers and EU funding
       opportunities.

3.5.13 Establish an EU-level shared liability and assurance mechanism for open
       and community-based AI components used in public services and other
       high-trust environments.

This mechanism should provide standardized indemnity, incident response support, and
limited financial coverage for approved open AI components that meet defined security and
transparency criteria. Funding should come from a combination of EU digital programmes and
a small, mandatory allocation within public-sector IT procurement budgets. Participation
should be conditional on compliance with AI Act and Cyber Resilience Act requirements.

Comment: today, many public authorities and enterprises avoid open AI solutions not because
of technical risk, but because there is no clear entity willing or able to assume legal
responsibility. This creates a structural bias in favor of large proprietary vendors, even when
open solutions are more transparent, auditable, and secure. Without addressing this liability
gap, Europe risks regulating in favor of incumbents while unintentionally excluding startups,
foundations, and community-driven innovation from real-world deployment.

Justification: Open and community-based AI often delivers public value but does not fit
traditional corporate liability models. Requiring individual maintainers or small startups to

                                          Page 25 z 43
provide full legal and financial guarantees is unrealistic and suppresses adoption. A shared EU
assurance mechanism spreads systemic risk in the same way public insurance schemes do
for other critical infrastructures. This approach enables deployment of trustworthy European
AI while maintaining accountability and protecting users, administrations, and innovators
alike.

3.6 Cross-Cutting Implementation Principles

Coordination and Accountability
Establish a high-level "European Open Source Strategy Council" chaired by the Commission
and including Member State ministers responsible for digital affairs, meeting quarterly to:
review progress on all initiatives with published scorecards; resolve coordination challenges
and bottlenecks; and commit new resources and political support as needed.

Phased Timeline with Clear Milestones

   â¢   2026 (Foundation Year): Legal frameworks adopted, funding mechanisms
       established, OSPO network expanded, infrastructure procurement initiated
   â¢   2027 (Deployment Year): First code publications under new mandates, procurement
       reforms enforced, initial scale-up funding awarded, infrastructure operational
   â¢   2028-2030 (Scale Year): Full enforcement of all measures, measurable impact on
       dependency reduction, European open source companies reaching scale, Digital
       Decade targets met

Measurement and Transparency
All initiatives must include quantified success metrics published in annual "State of European
Open Source" report: percentage of public IT budget spent on open source (target: 40% by
2030); number of active OSPOs and full-time maintainers employed; lines of code published
under public funding mandates; European open source companies reaching >â¬10M revenue
(target: 200 by 2030); and reduction in critical dependencies on non-EU proprietary platforms
(measured by spend and technical components).

This comprehensive approach addresses each identified weakness with concrete, actionable
measures that collectively transform Europe's open source ecosystem from fragmented
potential into coordinated strategic capability.

4 What technology areas should be prioritised and why? for europe to
  be sovereing?
Europe should prioritize technology areas based on a strategic matrix evaluating: dependency
risk (current reliance on US/China Big Tech), feasibility of open source replacement
(maturity of alternatives), economic impact (spending volume and lock-in costs), strategic
value (criticality for sovereignty), and ecosystem readiness (European capability to deliver).
Below is a prioritized framework organized from "quick wins" to "long-term strategic
investments.

                                         Page 26 z 43
4.1 Tier 1: Quick Wins â High Feasibility, Immediate Impact

Productivity Suites (Office 365 / Google Workspace Replacement)

Why prioritize: This represents one of the easiest and most impactful replacements with
mature open source alternatives already deployed successfully across Europe.

Current dependency: Microsoft Office 365 and Google Workspace dominate European public
and private sectors, creating massive recurring costs, data exposure, and vendor lock-in from
classroom to boardroom.

Open source solution: LibreOffice, ONLYOFFICE, and Collabora Online provide feature-
comparable alternatives with proven enterprise deployment. Denmark's Ministry of Digital
Affairs began replacing Microsoft Office 365 with LibreOffice in summer 2025, with half of
employees transitioning immediately and full adoption by autumn 2025. The initiative is
explicitly framed as "reducing dependence on foreign tech providers" and "reinforcing
government control over public digital infrastructure".

Feasibility assessment:

   â¢   Technical maturity: LibreOffice has 20+ years development, full Microsoft format
       compatibility, and enterprise support from European vendors (Collabora, CIB,
       Alfresco)
   â¢   Migration complexity: Low to moderate; primarily training and workflow adjustment
       rather than technical barriers
   â¢   Cost savings: Elimination of per-seat licensing fees (typically â¬10-20/user/month)
       translates to millions in annual savings for large administrations
   â¢   Ecosystem support: Extensive European service provider network for
       implementation, training, and support

Recommended actions:

   â¢   Mandate "Office Suite Replacement Roadmaps" for all EU institutions and Member
       State administrations by Q4 2026
   â¢   Create â¬50 million EU fund for migration support (technical assistance, training,
       change management)
   â¢   Develop standardized interoperability testing ensuring seamless document exchange
       between open and proprietary formats
   â¢   Prohibit new Microsoft 365/Google Workspace procurement in public sector starting
       2027, with phase-out of existing contracts by 2029

Expected impact: 30-50% reduction in productivity software spending; elimination of major
data sovereignty concern; demonstration effect encouraging broader open source adoption.

4.2 Tier 2: High Strategic Priority â Moderate Feasibility, Critical for Sovereignty

Cloud Infrastructure (AWS / Azure / Google Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud
Alternatives)

                                         Page 27 z 43
Why prioritize: Cloud infrastructure represents the foundational layer determining control
over all digital services, with massive current spending flowing to US hyperscalers and
significant geopolitical vulnerability.

Current dependency: European organizations rely overwhelmingly on AWS, Microsoft Azure,
and Google Cloud, creating exposure to US CLOUD Act jurisdiction, potential service
interruption during geopolitical tensions, and technical lock-in through proprietary services.
Even "sovereign cloud" offerings from US hyperscalers (AWS European Sovereign Cloud,
Azure sovereign zones) remain under ultimate US parent company control.

European alternatives and open source foundation:

Full EU Sovereign Providers:

   â¢   OVHcloud (France): Europe's largest independent cloud provider with full-stack
       IaaS/PaaS built on OpenStack
   â¢   Scaleway (France): Developer-centric cloud with strong GPU/AI infrastructure focus
   â¢   Hetzner (Germany): Cost-efficient, high-performance infrastructure
   â¢   T-Systems/Open Telekom Cloud (Germany): Government and enterprise
       compliance specialization
   â¢   Exoscale (Switzerland/Austria): Privacy-focused infrastructure

Key advantage: These providers operate entirely under EU jurisdiction, eliminating CLOUD
Act exposure and simplifying GDPR compliance. Most are built on open standards
(OpenStack, Kubernetes) rather than proprietary APIs, reducing lock-in compared to
hyperscaler-specific services.

Feasibility assessment:

   â¢   Technical capability: European providers offer mature IaaS and increasingly capable
       PaaS, suitable for most workloads
   â¢   Feature gap: Advanced managed services (serverless, specialized databases, AI/ML
       platforms) lag US hyperscalers
   â¢   Migration complexity: High for workloads deeply integrated with AWS/Azure
       proprietary services; moderate for container-based or standards-compliant
       architectures
   â¢   Cost competitiveness: Often price-competitive or superior for compute/storage;
       potential premium for specialized services

Hybrid strategic approach:
Given that "local cloud providers still offer few viable alternatives for organizations focused on
European digital sovereignty" in all use cases, adopt a tiered strategy:

   1. Mandate EU providers for sensitive workloads: Government services, critical
      infrastructure, personal data processing, and defense/security applications must use
      full EU sovereign providers
   2. Support open source cloud orchestration: Invest heavily in European development of
      Kubernetes, OpenStack, and cloud-native tooling enabling multi-cloud portability

                                           Page 28 z 43
   3. Fund European PaaS maturity: Close the managed services gap through targeted
      development of open source alternatives to AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.
   4. Establish procurement preferences: Weight evaluation criteria toward sovereignty,
      open standards, and portability rather than pure feature breadth

Recommended actions:

   â¢   â¬500 million investment in European cloud provider capability enhancement (managed
       services, edge infrastructure, developer tooling)
   â¢   Mandate that 60% of public sector cloud spending go to full EU sovereign providers by
       2028
   â¢   Fund development of "cloud portability toolkit" based on Kubernetes and open
       standards enabling easy migration between providers
   â¢   Support GAIA-X federated infrastructure model enabling data exchange and workload
       portability across European providers

Expected impact: Reduction of US hyperscaler market share in sensitive sectors from ~70%
to <30% by 2030; increased European cloud provider revenue enabling reinvestment;
enhanced resilience against geopolitical service interruption.

4.3 Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure and Models

Why prioritize: AI represents the defining technology of the coming decades; current
dominance by US Big Tech (OpenAI/GPT, Google/Gemini, Anthropic/Claude) creates
existential dependency risk.

Current dependency: European organizations increasingly rely on proprietary US AI models
accessed via API, creating multiple vulnerabilities: model behavior controlled externally with
potential censorship or bias injection; training data and techniques opaque, preventing audit
and compliance verification; service continuity dependent on commercial/geopolitical factors;
and intellectual property generated using these tools subject to complex licensing terms.

4.4 Open source alternative landscape:

European initiatives:

   â¢   OpenEuroLLM: EU-funded fully open source model supporting 35 European
       languages, launched February 2025 under Digital Europe Programme
   â¢   Mistral (France): Leading European AI company releasing open models (Mistral Large,
       Mixtral) competitive with GPT-3.5/4
   â¢   Bielik AI (Poland): leading polish LLM and SLM open source initiativie
   â¢   Aleph Alpha (Germany): Sovereignty-focused AI with European training data and on-
       premises deployment

Global open models with European deployment:

   â¢   Meta LLaMA 3: Highly capable open weights model enabling fine-tuning and local
       deployment

                                         Page 29 z 43
    â¢   DeepSeek-R1, Falcon, Salamandra: Increasingly competitive alternatives

Strategic framework for AI sovereignty:

 Dimension        Big Tech Models                        Open Source Models

 Transparency     Black-box, limited explainability      Full model weights and code, auditability

 Sovereignty      US jurisdiction, license change risk   EU-based, aligned with data sovereignty

 Cost             Pay-per-token, escalates with usage    Infrastructure investment, predictable costs

 Customization    Limited fine-tuning options            Full fine-tuning and adaptation capability

 Security         Enterprise SLAs but external control   Requires internal discipline but controllable

 Regulatory fit   GDPR/AI Act compliance complex         Easier to align with transparency requirements

Feasibility assessment:

    â¢   Technical maturity: Open models increasingly competitive with proprietary
        alternatives for many use cases; gap narrowing rapidly
    â¢   Infrastructure requirement: Significant compute investment needed for training and
        inference; Europe has capacity through EuroHPC
    â¢   Expertise availability: Strong European AI research community but needs retention
        and scaling support
    â¢   Economic viability: Initial infrastructure cost substantial but eliminates ongoing API
        fees and enables value capture

Recommended actions:

    â¢   â¬1 billion European Open AI Initiative: Fund development, training, and deployment
        of open foundation models across key domains (multilingual LLMs, code generation,
        scientific computing, industrial applications)
    â¢   Mandate open models in public sector: Public administration AI applications must
        use auditable open models by default, with proprietary alternatives requiring explicit
        justification
    â¢   Establish European AI infrastructure: Expand EuroHPC Joint Undertaking capacity
        specifically for AI training and inference, providing subsidized access to European
        researchers and companies
    â¢   Support AI Act compliance tooling: Fund open source tools for model transparency,
        bias testing, and conformity assessment specifically designed for open models
    â¢   Create "European AI Commons": Central registry of open models, datasets,
        evaluation benchmarks, and training recipes

Hybrid approach: "Host open-source LLMs on EU-based or on-prem infrastructure. Keep Big
Tech LLMs for high-scale or niche needs, balancing scale and control". Public sector and
sensitive applications mandate open models; less critical use cases permit commercial APIs
with contractual safeguards.

                                                Page 30 z 43
Expected impact: Reduction of dependency on US AI services; enhanced AI Act compliance
through transparency; European AI industry growth; preservation of fundamental research
capability independent of commercial gatekeepers.

4.5 Cybersecurity Tooling and Supply Chain Security

Why prioritize: Cybersecurity is the foundation enabling all other digital sovereignty; open
source provides transparency essential for trustworthiness but requires systematic support.

Current situation: "More than half the critical infrastructure codebases analyzed depends on
open source", yet systematic support for security auditing, vulnerability management, and
secure development practices remains fragmented.

EU-FOSSA model: The EU Free and Open Source Software Auditing project initiated in 2014
demonstrated successful model for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in critical open
source components. The project received explicit endorsement in the EU Cybersecurity Act,
establishing "promotion of Security by Design principle, including contributing to Free and
Open Source Software by financing security audits".

Priority areas:

   1. Supply chain security tooling: SBOM generation, dependency analysis, vulnerability

4.6 Tier 3: Strategic Long-Term â High Complexity, Transformative Potential
4.6.1 Edge Computing and Industrial IoT

Why prioritize: Edge computing represents the physical infrastructure layer for industrial
digitalization, autonomous systems, and real-time applications where European industrial
strength can translate to digital advantage.

Strategic opportunity: "Europe's Potential in Edge Computing: Supporting Industrial
Innovation" study indicates strong European growth potential in Industrial IoT, with
Commission investments exceeding â¬250 million since 2021 specifically targeting Cloud-
Edge-IoT continuum.

European advantage: Strong industrial base in automotive, manufacturing, energy, and
logistics provides natural deployment context for edge solutions. The "Open Source Way to EU
Digital Sovereignty & Competitiveness" thematic roadmap specifically highlights European

       Undertaking
   â¢   Support for open source communities and SMEs in edge computing through Digital
       Europe Programme

Expected impact: European leadership in industrial edge computing; enabling competitive
advantage in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing; reduced dependency on US cloud-centric
architectures.

4.6.2 Digital Payments Infrastructure (Digital Euro)

Why prioritize: Payment infrastructure represents fundamental economic sovereignty;
current reliance on US-based card networks (Visa, Mastercard) and payment processors
creates strategic vulnerability.

Digital Euro opportunity: The European Central Bank's digital euro project provides once-in-
generation opportunity to establish public digital payment infrastructure as democratic
alternative to private systems.

                                         Page 32 z 43
Open source imperative: "The core infrastructure underpinning the Digital Euro â i.e., the
services and software used and provided by the European Central Bank and the other banks of
the Eurosystem â must be developed as open source software in order to ensure
transparency and avoid dependencies on external vendors".

Critical requirements:

    â¢   Privacy preservation: Replicate cash-like privacy characteristics with limited
        identification requirements and strict limits on data storage/sharing
    â¢   Open source infrastructure: Full transparency of ECB and Eurosystem software
        enabling public audit and preventing vendor lock-in
    â¢   Interoperability: Seamless integration with existing and emerging European payment
        solutions including stablecoins and tokenized deposits
    â¢   Collaborative ecosystem: Joint pan-European payments acceptance infrastructure

Regardless of specific technology area, several horizontal capabilities are essential:

    1. Identity and Access Management: EUDI Wallet provides foundation; expand to
       enterprise IAM use cases
    2. Data Sovereignty Infrastructure: European data spaces, sovereign data exchanges,
       privacy-enhancing technologies
    3. Open Standards and Interoperability: Aggressive standardization preventing
       proprietary lock-in across all domains
    4. Developer Tooling: European-hosted CI/CD, package registries, code repositories
       reducing infrastructure dependency

5 In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to
  increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?

The sectors offering highest combined competitiveness and cyber resilience benefits through open
source adoption are public administration (immediate procurement leverage, market creation, and
cross-border reuse) and automotive (European industrial strength facing software transformation
requiring collaborative development models).
pen source adoption can transform competitiveness and cyber resilience across multiple sectors by
reducing vendor dependencies, enabling rapid innovation, improving security transparency, and creating
interoperable ecosystems. Below are the sectors where increased open source use delivers the highest
strategic value for Europe.

5.1 Automotive: Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV)
Why Open Source is Critical: The automotive industry is undergoing fundamental transformation from
hardware-centric to software-defined vehicles, where up to 90% of innovation now occurs in software.
European automotive manufacturers face intense competition from software-native companies (Tesla)
and tech giants entering the market (Apple, Chinese EV manufacturers with advanced software
integration).

                                            Page 34 z 43
5.1.1 Competitiveness Benefits
Accelerated development through shared infrastructure: Open source enables collaboration on
"non-differentiating" softwareâmiddleware handling communication, authentication, diagnostics, and
core vehicle functions that don't provide competitive advantage but are essential and costly to develop.
In June 2025, major German automotive players including ZF signed a declaration to intensify
cooperation on open source software specifically for these components.
ZF's Senior Manager Gunther Bauer explained: "A significant portion of a vehicle's software is not
directly visible to drivers and doesn't offer manufacturers a competitive edge. Such software modules
can be developed collaboratively by multiple manufacturers and suppliers within an open ecosystem".
This community-driven approach often results in foundational software that is "more powerful and
reliable than isolated proprietary code".
Cost efficiency and resource reallocation: By sharing development of commodity layers through
open source, manufacturers can redirect engineering resources toward differentiating featuresâuser
experience, autonomous driving algorithms, brand-specific interfacesâwhere competitive advantage
actually exists. The Android model demonstrates this approach: hardware specialists collaborate on
foundational software with standardized interfaces, while competing intensely on final user-facing
features.
Ecosystem participation and standard-setting: Organizations participating in open source
automotive ecosystems (SOAFEE, Eclipse SDV Working Group, COVESA) gain influence over
emerging standards and early access to shared innovations. "Those who join early can help shape the
standards," Bauer noted, explaining ZF's motivation for active open source engagement.
Leveling the playing field: Open source "champions a shared ecosystem for the Software-Defined
Vehicle, levelling the playing field for all involvedâwhether established OEMs, Tier 1, 2, or 3 suppliers,
or emerging software companies". This prevents tech giants from capturing the entire value chain and
enables European suppliers to remain competitive.
5.1.2 Cyber Resilience Benefits
Security through transparency: Open source automotive software enables security auditing by
manufacturers, suppliers, and independent researchers, identifying vulnerabilities before deployment
rather than relying solely on proprietary vendor assurances.
Rapid vulnerability response: Community-driven development enables faster identification and
patching of security issues across the entire automotive ecosystem, rather than each manufacturer
independently discovering and fixing the same problems.
Supply chain visibility: Open source facilitates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and
dependency tracking, critical for meeting emerging automotive cybersecurity regulations and managing
supply chain risks.
5.1.3 EU Policy Support
The European Commission's "Vehicle of the Future" initiative specifically aims to enhance
competitiveness of EU software-defined vehicles industry, recognizing open source as essential
enabler. The Chips Joint Undertaking funds open source automotive platforms as strategic priority.
5.1.4 Recommended actions:
    â¢   Mandate open source for non-differentiating vehicle software in EU-funded automotive projects
    â¢   Establish European automotive open source competence center providing shared
        infrastructure, testing, and certification

                                              Page 35 z 43
    â¢   Create procurement preferences for vehicles using open, interoperable software architectures
    â¢   Fund European alternatives to proprietary automotive operating systems (competing with
        Android Automotive)

5.2 Public Administration and Digital Government Services
Why Open Source is Critical: Public administration represents Europe's largest IT buyer, with
purchasing power to shape markets and create sustainable open source ecosystems. Digital
government services are foundational infrastructure determining citizens' relationship with the state and
enabling broader digital economy.
5.2.1 Competitiveness Benefits
Market creation for European SMEs
Open source public administration platforms create competitive markets for implementation,
customization, support, and integration services that European SMEs can access without competing
against entrenched proprietary vendors. This contrasts with proprietary ecosystems where "only the
vendor who owns the IP can provide services".
As Linux Foundation Europe notes: "Governments actively seek commercial open source software for
needs that could benefit multiple administrations; public sector encourages commercialization of
solutions built for their needs; procurement insists on true open source software and adherence to open
standards; a competitive, open market for solutions is maintained". This approach "leverages the scale
and incentives that make proprietary software vendors successful while maintaining the transparency,
interoperability, and freedom from vendor lock-in that open source provides".
Cross-border reuse and efficiency
Open source enables administrations to share solutions across jurisdictions, dramatically reducing
redundant development and procurement costs. Estonia's X-Road data exchange layer, released as
open source, has been adopted by Finland, Iceland, and other nations, demonstrating scalable public
infrastructure.
Innovation acceleration
Open source platforms enable rapid iteration and experimentation with new service delivery models
without lengthy procurement cycles or vendor negotiation. Developers can build on existing platforms,
creating vibrant ecosystems of third-party services.
Technological sovereignty
Public money funding open source creates strategic assets controlled by European public sector rather
than enriching foreign vendors. This supports EU digital sovereignty goals by ensuring critical
government infrastructure remains under European control.
5.2.2 Cyber Resilience Benefits
Reduced attack surface through transparency
Open source government software enables security auditing by public, academic, and private sector
researchers, creating "many eyes" review that proprietary systems cannot match.
Independence from vendor security practices
Administrations can independently patch vulnerabilities or hire third parties for security hardening rather
than depending on proprietary vendor timelines and priorities.
Interoperability enabling resilience
Open standards and interfaces inherent in open source allow administrations to maintain redundant
systems and failover capabilities across different implementations, preventing single points of failure.

                                               Page 36 z 43
Continuity of operations
Open source ensures that governments can maintain critical systems even if original vendors exit the
market, are acquired, or face sanctions/restrictions.
5.2.3 Strategic Implementation Framework
OpenFuture's submission on Public Digital Infrastructure identifies three priority areas:
    1. Digitalization of government services: Adopt open source and interoperable solutions guided
       by "public money, public code," using strategic procurement to shape markets and reduce
       proprietary dependency
    2. Business digital transformation: Make support for digital adoption conditional on
       contributions to technological sovereignty and open ecosystems
    3. Skills development: Emphasize transferable skills in open technologies rather than reinforcing
       proprietary vendor dependence
5.2.4 Recommended actions:
    â¢   Mandate open source first for all government digital services (case management, citizen
        portals, data platforms)
    â¢   Create pan-European library of reusable government open source components with technical
        support
    â¢   Establish "GovTech Open Source" accelerator connecting public sector needs with European
        developers
    â¢   Require open source and open standards in all EU Digital Europe Programme-funded
        government projects

5.3 Healthcare: Electronic Health Records and Medical Interoperability
Why Open Source is Critical: Healthcare systems face critical challenges of interoperability, data
portability, vendor lock-in, and cybersecurity threats while managing sensitive patient data across
fragmented organizational boundaries.
5.3.1 Competitiveness Benefits
Interoperability and data exchange
Open source health information systems based on open standards (openEHR, FHIR) enable seamless
data exchange across providers, regions, and national borders. OpenEHR provides "an open platform
where both the software and the information models for interoperability are widely available for any
organization that wants to adopt them".
This increases resilience by "allowing health organizations to choose open source options or proprietary
openEHR-based platforms if they require extended functionality. Additionally, in the event of a critically
compromised system, the information layer still can be used by replacing the software layer since the
underlying data representation formalism is the same".
Accessibility in resource-constrained settings
GNU Health has been "designed with the ideas of interoperability and accessibility. The GNU Health
Federation facilitates the integration of individuals and heterogeneous health informatic systems into a
regional or national health network". The federated network permits nationwide health networks "while
ensuring the continuity of operations at the local nodes, a key factor in areas where the Internet network
connectivity is sub-optimal".

                                              Page 37 z 43
Customization for specialized needs
Healthcare organizations turn to open source for "much-needed customization, system interoperability,
and fewer concerns around vendor lock-in than commercial, off-the-shelf software". Open source
enables tailoring to specific clinical workflows, regulatory requirements, and integration with specialized
medical devices.
Cost reduction
Elimination of per-user licensing fees for EHR systemsâoften hospitals' largest software expenseâ
enables reinvestment in clinical care and digital health innovation.
5.3.2 Cyber Resilience Benefits
Vulnerability management and security transparency
Open source enables "regular bug fixes from the vast open-source developer community" and allows
organizations to independently verify security properties. However, this requires discipline: "healthcare
organizations must maintain an accurate inventory of components and prioritize swift software updates".
SBOM requirements driving accountability
FDA mandates for Software Bills of Materials in medical devices will "help healthcare organizations
identify potential vulnerabilities faster. That improved visibility will enable better risk management of
open-source components". The mandate "shifts secure development and effective open-source
management from a best practice to a requirement" and will "help improve open-source software
security over time".
Ransomware resilience
"Digital health systems suffer from an upward trend in data breaches, with thousands of patient records
compromised by different types of cyberattacks," including devastating ransomware attacks. Open
source architectures with distributed data storage and federation models enable faster recovery and
limit impact compared to monolithic proprietary systems.
Security-by-design approaches
Open source projects can "adapt their designs to more resilient architectures including the security-by-
design and zero trust approaches in order to deal with future cyber risks", implementing modern security
paradigms more rapidly than legacy proprietary systems.
Operational Requirements
Healthcare organizations must implement robust governance: "establishing governance oversight
policies, implementing automated open-source dependency tracking, and integrating open-source
management into their software development lifecycles". This includes maintaining accurate component
inventories and prioritizing rapid updates.
5.3.3 Recommended actions:
    â¢   Fund European open source EHR platforms (openEHR, GNU Health) for EU-wide deployment
    â¢   Mandate FHIR and open standards for all health data exchange funded through EU health
        programs
    â¢   Create European health data interoperability testing and certification based on open standards
    â¢   Support cybersecurity tooling specifically for healthcare open source (vulnerability scanning,
        SBOM generation, security testing)

5.4 Financial Services: Open Banking and Financial Infrastructure
Why Open Source is Critical: Financial services face regulatory mandates for open APIs (PSD2, open
banking), increasing cyber threats, and intense competition from fintech challengers.

                                                Page 38 z 43
5.4.1 Competitiveness Benefits
Accelerated innovation and time-to-market
Financial institutions use open source to "maintain their competitive edge. By adopting and contributing
to open source technologies, firms can significantly reduce operational costs, accelerate development
timelines, and gain access to a vast pool of talent". Open source involvement serves as "a powerful
recruiting tool in an increasingly competitive talent market".
The Linux Foundation's FINOS (Fintech Open Source Foundation) 2025 Roadmap notes that open
source creates "a ripple effect in the industry, driving greater innovation and making open source
involvement a competitive necessity rather than a niche interest".
Compliance as competitive advantage
Open banking regulations require secure data sharing through standardized APIs. Institutions with
strong compliance frameworks "can quickly adapt to new developments as the regulatory landscape
evolves. This allows them to embrace opportunities ahead of less-prepared rivals by offering services
that meet current customer needs and comply with new mandates".
Open source facilitates compliance through transparent implementation of regulatory requirements and
shared development of Common Cloud Controls and security frameworks.
Market expansion potential
Juniper Research projects open banking payments will surge from $57 billion in 2023 to over $330
billion by 2027, with "Europe gets it right, however, open finance has the potential to become an
essential competitive advantage for its financial services sector".
Enhanced customer trust
"By prioritizing data protection and privacy, banks show they are committed to safeguarding client
information" through transparent, auditable open source implementations. With 47% of consumers using
at least three fintech apps, "there is clearly a strong expectation for secure and compliant data-sharing
practices".
5.4.2 Cyber Resilience Benefits
Improved security posture through collaboration
"The collaborative nature of open source development leads to more robust, well-tested code that can
withstand" financial sector security requirements. Open source projects like FINOS's Common Cloud
Controls help "financial institutions address compliance challenges while maintaining robust security
frameworks".
Rapid vulnerability response
Open source enables financial institutions to collectively address security threats rather than each
organization independently discovering and remediating the same vulnerabilities.
API security and authentication
Open banking's reliance on APIs creates heightened cybersecurity risk: "As financial data becomes
more accessible through APIs, there is a heightened risk of data breaches and fraud". Open source API
security frameworks and authentication protocols enable transparent security verification that proprietary
alternatives cannot provide.
Reduced vendor concentration risk
Financial sector reliance on a few large technology vendors creates systemic risk. Open source
diversifies the technology supply chain and prevents single vendor failures from cascading across the
industry.
Strategic Considerations

                                              Page 39 z 43
Security concerns remain paramount: "Financial institutions and third-party providers must implement
robust security measures to protect sensitive customer information and ensure compliance with
regulatory standards". This requires investment in security expertise and governance frameworks
specifically for open source.

5.5 Energy: Smart Grid and Critical Infrastructure
Why Open Source is Critical: Energy systems face unprecedented challenges from renewable
integration, distributed energy resources, climate-driven disruptions, and sophisticated cyber threats
targeting critical infrastructure.
5.5.1 Competitiveness Benefits
Grid modernization and flexibility
Smart grid technologies including "smart meters, sensors, and automated controls improve grid
monitoring, fault detection, and response times". Open source enables innovation in grid management
software without vendor lock-in, allowing utilities to rapidly adopt emerging technologies.
Distributed Energy Resource (DER) integration
"Integrating renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, along with energy storage systems
diversifies energy supply and enhances grid flexibility". Open source platforms enable interoperability
across diverse DER technologies and manufacturers, preventing fragmentation.
Cost optimization through data-driven decision making
Integrated Grid Planning (IGP) uses "data-driven decision making with advanced analytics and
forecasting for grid investments and operations," creating "a flexible framework that adapts to emerging
technologies and changing energy needs". Open source analytics platforms enable utilities to leverage
best-in-class algorithms without proprietary analytics vendor lock-in.
Infrastructure investment efficiency
"Upgrading physical components of the grid, such as transmission lines, substations, and transformers"
requires massive capital investment. Open source software maximizes return on hardware investments
by enabling continuous software improvement without recurring licensing costs.
5.5.2 Cyber Resilience Benefits
Security-by-design for critical infrastructure
The SUCCESS (Securing Critical Energy Infrastructures) project emphasizes "security by design
approach and placing resiliency and survivability in focus, a new joint design of Energy Infrastructure
and ICT". Open source enables transparent security architecture review impossible with proprietary
systems controlling critical infrastructure.
End-node security through innovation
SUCCESS proposes "New-generation Open Real-time smart Meter (NORM) as a key building block" to
"secure the end nodes of the energy system while providing innovative services in a customer centric

                                              Page 40 z 43
grid". Open source smart meter firmware enables independent security auditing and rapid vulnerability
patching.
Cloud-based resilience and virtualization
"At systems level, a cloud-approach, based on double virtualization, is proposed" for energy
infrastructure. Open source cloud platforms (OpenStack, Kubernetes) provide flexibility to move critical
workloads across infrastructure providers during disruptions or cyber attacks.
Cybersecurity protocol strengthening
"Strengthening cybersecurity protocols to protect the grid from cyber-attacks and ensure the integrity of
critical infrastructure" is essential. Open source security tools enable continuous monitoring and threat
detection without dependence on proprietary security vendors that may face conflicts of interest.
Rapid recovery from disruptions
Grid resilience requires "ability to withstand and recover from disruptions, ensuring a continuous supply
of electricity". Open source enables utilities to maintain alternative control systems and rapidly
reconfigure operations during cyber incidents or physical disruptions.

5.6 Telecommunications: 5G Open RAN and Network Infrastructure
Why Open Source is Critical: Telecommunications infrastructure represents critical national
infrastructure with acute geopolitical sensitivities around vendor trustworthiness (Huawei restrictions),
combined with technology transition to software-defined, virtualized architectures.
5.6.1 Competitiveness Benefits
Disaggregation enabling vendor diversity
Open RAN architecture "allows operators to build upon the capabilities enabled by 5G" through
disaggregation, breaking the integrated vendor model that historically locked operators into single
suppliers (Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei). This creates opportunities for European component vendors and
software specialists to compete in previously closed ecosystems.
Accelerated innovation and deployment
"Open RAN supported by cloud-based services will increase the speed with which operators can install
software and operating system security patches". Open interfaces enable rapid integration of new
capabilities without waiting for monolithic vendor release cycles.
Cost reduction and flexibility
Disaggregated architecture allows operators to select best-in-class components and mix hardware from
cost-effective suppliers with advanced software from specialists, optimizing total cost of ownership.

                                               Page 41 z 43
Small operator empowerment
Open RAN "will be particularly important to small rural carriers, who may have more limited resources to
dedicate to upgrading and patching network" infrastructure. Open source lowers barriers to entry and
reduces dependence on expensive proprietary support contracts.
5.6.2 Cyber Resilience Benefits
Edge-focused security analytics
"Open RAN allows operators to shift the security capabilities closer to the edge of the network and stop
attacks closer to the source". Open interfaces enable "distributing security analytics throughout the
network and moving RAN monitoring to the edge. This creates opportunities to create edge-focused
analytics that speed the detection and prevention of network attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities".
Rapid vulnerability response
Open RAN enables operators to "minimize the amount of time a vulnerability is in the network" through
rapid software updates, particularly critical for small carriers with limited resources.
DDoS prevention at the edge
"Rapid detection and response can enable efficient and more secure support of mobility services,
especially IoT services by more effectively preventing DDoS attacks on the RAN by rogue mobile
devices". Distributed security analytics allows sharing insights "between the RAN and core, as well as
between different RAN locations".
Best-in-class security integration
"Open RAN will allow operators to integrate best-in-class security platforms with open interfaces,"
enabling specialized security vendors to provide advanced protection rather than relying solely on
network equipment vendor security capabilities.
Network-level security measures
Critical protections include "encryption to protect data, authentication protocols to verify the identity of
users and devices, and access controls to prevent unauthorized access to network resources". Open
source implementations enable transparent verification of these security properties.
Ongoing monitoring and management
"Continuous security monitoring and management processes" are essential. Open RAN architectures
facilitate integration of advanced security orchestration and automation tools.
Risk Mitigation Requirements
"Securing 5G's open RAN architecture is a critical challenge that requires careful planning and the
implementation of robust security measures". The "open and virtualized nature of 5G networks, as well
as the increasing reliance on software and network functions, can create new vulnerabilities and
potential threats".
Essential measures include "secure communication protocols, strong authentication and access
controls, and regular software and firmware updates". A "risk-based approach" must guide security
architecture decisions.
5.6.3 Recommended actions:
