1.   What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open              -source sector? What
     are the main barriers that hamper
         (i) adoption and maintenance of high        -quality and secure open source;
         Open Source comes under a strict legal framework under the regime of copyright law.
         Potential adopters might not be fully aware of legal implications. Consulting and
         tooling support often comes at costs that are prohibitive for smaller industry players.
         An increasing amount of maintainers are overwhelmed by pressure from adopters and
         regulations. E.g. the Cyber Resilience Act puts new bureaucratic and costly burdens
         on open source participants, particularly commercial entities. Compared with non-EU
         companies, this could become a huge competitive disadvantage.
         (ii) sustainable contributions to open      -source communities?
         Contributions are often hindered by a culture that doesnât see the value in giving away
         their own changes for free. We have examples where single vendors have accepted
         contributions from the community and later turned them into proprietary products
         without rewarding the contributors. Open source that is maintained by foundations
         like the Eclipse Foundation get a much higher trust level so they should be fostered.

     Strengths

     â¢   European auto makers are collaborating already in traditional organizations like VDA or
         ASAM and in new formats like the Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) work group,
         Interoperable Europe Act, Gaia-X, Catena-X.
     â¢   A big strength lies in the fact that most Open Source contributors are European (at
         least likely, reliable numbers are difficult to get). China is probably #2, USA #3. India
         and Africa are catching up.

     Weaknesses

     â¢   The European automotive sector faces unprecedented challenges: fragmented
         standards, dependency on proprietary systems, and the rapid rise of global
         competitors. Consider software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where functionalities from
         infotainment to autonomous driving rely on complex software stacks. Proprietary
         solutions often lock manufacturers into siloed ecosystems, stifling interoperability
         and inflating costs. While it is positive that there are increasing numbers of
         commercial consumers of open source software, far too few of these consumers are
         participating and contributing to the upstream projects, meaning that the vast bulk of
         the burden of keeping these projects viable and secure falls on unpaid volunteer
         developers and maintainers.
     â¢   Those projects are often not funded adequately and lack brain drain when developers
         stop contributing in their free time. As if this was not enough, new regulations like the
         Cyber Resilience Act create new burdens on open source projects, further exhausting
         the developers.
     â¢   Europe is still in the beginnings of creating a culture where collaboration on common
         functionalities as open source software is the new normal. To a large extent, open
         source stewards like the Eclipse Foundation rely on funding by member companies
         while no one questions that public funding of streets or airports is in the public
         interest.
     â¢   Despite promising open source projects like Sovereign Cloud Stack, EU sovereign
         cloud offerings are rarely used compared to global big tech players offerings. Even the
         ecosystem is relying to a large degree on non-sovereign infrastructure (e.g. developer
         collaboration platforms). Migration to sovereign technologies is often badly supported.
         Big foreign players can afford the effort to certify their products according to EU
         standards. Small European vendors cannot afford these efforts. Also, public
         administration is often choosing foreign vendors over European vendors for office
         applications.
     â¢   European industry like auto makers are in urgent need for sovereign yet scalable cloud
         offerings for the implementation of their business processes. Public spendings do not
         yet primarily go into sovereign technologies.
     â¢   Another big weakness lies in the perceived paradox that even though Open Source
         software is freely available to everyone world-wide, the very place where the majority
         of open source development happens are platforms owned by US companies. This in
         turn creates an unwanted dependence. The very ecosystem we're relying upon for
         open source software and digital independence is predominantly under American
         stewardship â from core governance bodies (FSF, OSI, Creative Commons) to
         development platforms (GitHub, GitLab, â¦) and cloud infrastructure.
     â¢   Public procurement often builds up barriers that are too high for offerings based on
         open source software and hence such budgets usually flow to big tech companies
         from abroad. This money would urgently be needed to foster sovereign open source
         projects. Save a few positive examples, it seems that the public sector in the EU is
         lagging behind significantly in the adoption of Free and Open Source Software and
         related tools.

2.   What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors?
     Please provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk,
     lock -in, security, innovation, among others) that are most important to assess
     the added value.
     Software development is nearly impossible without open source these days. Almost 100%
     of all software projects rely on FOSS. Much of the code in a software project is in fact
     made up of open source, sometimes up to 80%. All the advantages of FOSS apply to
     public and private sectors alike, e.g. substantial cost savings, transparency, innovation
     and faster development, higher quality and so forth. Digital sovereignty is only achievable
     with open source software because building up all this infrastructure requires so much
     collaboration to be cost efficient. This is true for the public sector that increasingly
     understand the negative consequences for untrustable dependencies. But digital
     sovereignty is also essential for the automotive industry since they rely more and more on
     a digital infrastructure outside of vehicles. Most striking example is the cloud
     infrastructure that is dominated by the hyperscalers.
     Several publications discuss the value of open source use and contributions like from
     Frank Nagle and Henry Chesbrough.
3.   What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
     development and growth of the EU open -source sector and contribute to the
     EUâs technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?
     a. Strengthen the technical communities who maintain foundational software (e.g. foster
        open source stewards like the Eclipse Foundation since they provide the infrastructure
        for collaboration.)
     b. Sustainably fund the ecosystem for hosting open source projects. E.g. many projects
        ask for sponsoring for build infrastructure or rely on âfreeâ offerings from abroad.
     c. Strategically support those open source technologies that are aligned with our
        industrial, regulatory, and societal goals.
     d. In the automotive sector, this could mean co-investing in software stacks that power
        electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems, or in tools that improve functional
        safety and software lifecycle compliance.
     e. Direct public spendings primarily to digital sovereign offerings. Public organizations
        should be mandated to have an Open Source Program Office to align IT spendings with
        open source priorities.
     f. Have a clear view of the existing open source ecosystem to understand why so much
        of it is concentrated outside of Europe. Examples: Access to investors and funds,
        relaxed bureaucratic burdens, business-friendly policies
     g. Support European OS organizations as well as the countless local SMEs and
        independent companies that center their business model on open source software
     h. Facilitate influx of experts in building open source software and sovereign
        infrastructure.
     i. Strengthen the software supply chain security not just by establishing the Cyber
        Resilience Act with associated standards but build and support and infrastructure and
        services for open source projects to live up to the CRA requirements.

4.   What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
     a. Tools that improve automotive functional safety and security, software lifecycle
        compliance so that we can rely on the components that we increasingly depend on.
     b. Tools for license compliance and software security since they are needed by everyone
        in the open source community - from enterprises to SMEs and individuals - and that
        often come at prohibitive costs.
     c. Cloud base components to build a sovereign could infrastructure
     d. In general technologies around the Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) stack and
        simulation / validation.
     e. Data infrastructures like Gaia-X to support an open ecosystem for data based on open
        source technology.

5.   In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
     competitiveness and cyber resilience?
     a. Automotive components that offer common functionalities so that we can free
        resources for differentiating functionalities and innovations like software stacks that
        power electric vehicles, autonomous driving systems, secure communication layers,
        over-the-air update frameworks, or modular autonomous driving tools.
b. Sovereign could infrastructure to stay independent also for the backends of
   increasingly connected vehicles.
c. All existing European key technology sectors as well as trending and emerging fields
   such as AI, robotics, Telecom/5G/6G, Smart Grids, Public Sector und Healthcare.
