Thoughts about benefits of OpenSource
The benefits of FOSS are numerous and interconnected.

Sovereignty
Exploitation
In the example of Microsoft vs IBM, Microsoft showed that software platforms dominate
markets, and closed-source, for-profit platforms stifle competition. At some point, for-profit
companies reach a plateau of new customers and simply need to charge existing customers
more to achieve growth. For-profit companies also disregard possible long-lasting damage to
society. For example, Meta (formerly Facebook) suppressed internal research showing that
its platform leads to various mental health harms.

Politics
Technology cannot be separated from politics. This is evident in cases such as Microsoft
suspending services for ICC judge Karim Khan. Foreign for-profit companies obey the
actions of foreign leaders. For example, Trump threatened to pull the broadcasting license of
CBS. Currently, with such high dependence on foreign software and services, the EU is
indefensible against hostile foreign acts. It is important to note that possible hostile actions
by foreign for-profit companies will be commanded by foreign leaders, not by CEOs. When
assessing trust in a foreign company (for example, Microsoft), it is not enough to consider
only its for-profit motives; we must also consider the foreign leader who might command
hostile actions (for example, Trump). This means we should not ask ourselves if we trust
Microsoft, but if we trust Trump.

Cost Effectiveness
Open source is a long-term, cost-effective solution. The narrative of for-profit companies is
that the total cost of ownership is lower with a subscription, but in the long term, these
companies exploit users as the cost of switching becomes prohibitive. Using FOSS in
corporate environments is not necessarily free, as there are maintenance and support costs,
but software subscription costs are greatly reduced. For example, the mandatory upgrade
from Windows 10 to Windows 11 rendered millions of PCs obsolete or a security risk due to
a one-sided decision by a for-profit company. Such actions do not align with EU
environmental goals or basic consumer protection. A clear example of cost effectiveness is
the use of FOSS by large hyperscalers like Google and Amazon. These companies use
Linux as the basis for their services because the costs of depending on for-profit OS
manufacturers would be exorbitant. They also benefit from the ability to adapt the OS to their
exact needs.

Personal Mental Freedom
The digital tools we use become an extension of ourselves. Time invested in learning to use
digital tools can be wasted if users lose access to them. Creative software now costs an
exorbitant amount for starting artists or non-professionals. If an artist loses a job and thus
access to such tools (usually paid for by their employer), they lose their main creative
instrument. In contrast, if the education system relies on FOSS tools, artists always retain
access to their learned skills. The years invested in personal education cannot be taken
away by a company raising prices or changing the work environment.

Shared Infrastructure
FOSS should be viewed as shared infrastructure. The EU should not be breeding future
predators, but should instead develop efficient digital infrastructure that everyday citizens
can use in their daily work and that companies can use to run their businesses efficiently and
safely: without the risk of spiking costs or foreign interference. The EU should strive for
interoperability and open formats, providing future innovative companies with a larger pool of
users.
