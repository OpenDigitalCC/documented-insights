   This is a proposal to create an "Open Source Peace Corps" â an institution to vet
and deploy volunteers who help small European organisations make the transition to open
source or EU-controlled software.

1    Motivation

We are in the future. Without digital sovereignty, there is no sovereignty of any kind, at
least, not for long.
    The ICCâs Chief Prosecutor, Karim Khan, managed to attract the ire of the Trump
administration in 2024 for issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gal-
lant in connection with war crimes and crimes against humanity. When Microsoft then
denied Khan access to his email account, it sent a warning to EU officials that their policy
decisions may be tolerated, but not unconditionally tolerated. Trump is willing to use
US tech companies as instruments of his political will, and at least Microsoft, producer of
Europeâs dominant operating system, is willing to obey.
   In 2025, the European Commission ordered Google to perform structural changes as
an anti-trust measure. Google refused.
    Under the US CLOUD Act of 2018, data hosted inside the EU by a US company, or any
company that has a legal presence in the US, is subject to US law. This is in clear conflict
with the EUâs GDPR. And yet, the EU is seemingly incapable of enforcing its own law,
presumably because it lacks sufficient domestic cloud capability to replace the capability
it stands to lose.
    The European Commission has historically shown reluctance to tax foreign financial
and IT services, even where it has a mind-boggling trade deficit. The fear is that it should
lose access to those services during any trade dispute which involves them.
    Foreign tech companies have free access to the EU information highways, which have
been used to sow misinformation that directly targets the integrity of the EU. Elon Musk,
head of the social media platform X (formerly twitter) has openly called for the abolition
of the EU. Yet, EU leaders continue to use that platform in their official capacities. This
is a mind-blowing level of submission.
    Conclusion: The EU has a sovereignty crisis. It risks becoming a Guam, an unincor-
porated territory of the US: It may make its own laws, as long as those laws do not annoy
the US.

2    Concept

In 1961, at the height of the cold war, the US created the Peace Corps. Volunteers were
invited to work in third world countries to improve the living standards of the residents.
While the project was attributed humanitarian goals by its creators, it was primarily a non-
military means for the US to expand its sphere of influence and to push back encroachments
by the Soviet Union.
   The proposal here is to create a "PC Corps," which would be an EU-level administrative
body responsible for coÃ¶rdinating volunteers, along with responsibility for a few limited
areas of oversight and funding. Volunteers on the ground would provide tech support for

                                             2
open source software to small organisations.

3     Responsibilities

The services provided by the parent organisation would be:

    1. Vetting volunteers.

         â¢ Only individuals without criminal records would be allowed to participate.
         â¢ Individual with records of public service would be processed preferentially.
         â¢ The volunteers would be issued identification cards that would attest to clients
           their trustworthiness.

    2. Tracking performance.

         â¢ Clients would have the opportunity to register complaints with the parent or-
           ganisation.
         â¢ Volunteers would be constantly reevaluated based on success rate in the field.

    3. Advertising

         â¢ Recruiting volunteers
         â¢ Informing the public of services available.

4     Clients

    â¢ NGOs

    â¢ Schools

    â¢ Libraries

    â¢ Small businesses

    â¢ Governments of small municipalities

   Private citizens could in principle be on the potential client list. However, the most tech-
nologically adept citizens are already reachable through the aforementioned institutions.
Other citizens represent a much greater expense of time with the least redistribution of
know-how.
    Large business could in principle be on the potential client list. However, they are the
least likely to need technical assistance.

                                               3
5     Volunteers

The first generation of computer teens is now approaching retirement age. These peo-
ple would presumably form the backbone of the corps and would mentor the otherwise
unemployed youth in the project.
    The roles for volunteers would be:

    1. Triage of service requests

         â¢ Volunteers would necessarily be matched to tasks within their capabilities.
         â¢ Senior volunteers would be assigned only the most challenging tasks.

    2. Help desk for applications

    3. Help desk for operating systems

         â¢ The PC Corps would likely focus on one linux distribution, presumably one
           based in Europe.

    4. On-site server administration

         â¢ setting up servers
         â¢ upgrading, reinstalling, trouble-shooting

    5. Maintenance of PC Corps infrastructure

         â¢ websites
         â¢ kanban boards
         â¢ archives of compiled and verified software

    6. PC Corps projects (See Projects section)

5.1     Why would citizens want to volunteer?

5.1.1    It is a Historic Moment for the EU.

Many Europeans experience frustration at what might be called techno-feudalism: billion-
aires control all mainstream digital resources in a civilisation whose existence is increas-
ingly digital. A PC Corps would allow both IT experts and non-experts to participate in a
historically-significant movement. It is a great relief to have a means of dealing with oneâs
frustration.

5.1.2    Career Opportunities

A volunteer might expect to network with business clients, and thereby making him-
self/herself known to potential employers. If a business decides to expand or to pro-
fessionalise, the first name to come to mind would be one they already know.

                                             4
5.1.3    Professional Qualification

The PC Corps could present certificates of achievement to volunteers which indicate the
skills demonstrated in the field.

5.1.4    Entry-level Experience

AI can perform most of the tasks that entry-level IT professionals can do. However, how is
anyone to rise to the rank of a mid-level professional without gaining entry-level experience?
The PC Corps would be a means of keeping humans in the game.

6     Projects

There are particular services that are unprofitable to providers, yet extremely useful to
recipients.

6.1     Installing Linux

For most users, installing linux is going to be as easy as the installation wizard is designed
to make it. For other users, who need to install experimental drivers to support recent or
rare hardware, some technical expertise is usually welcome.

6.2     Migration to Open Source Apps

Moving from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice is rather straight-forward, but moving from
Photoshop to Gimp can be awkward; Gimp has a foreign mindset. Decentralised Social
Media lacks algorithmic curation of feeds. While this ought to be considered a plus, users
who are experimenting for the first time with platforms such as Mastodon can feel lost.

6.3     Local Cloud

It used to be the case that cloud solutions required considerable technical expertise. How-
ever, open source software like Germanyâs own Nextcloud may be set up by following a
recipe, and requires no maintenance thereafter (other than backups).

6.4     Local AI

While foreign tech giants clearly dominate the AI market, there are freely available AI
models (released by those same tech giants) that can run on gaming computers. They
can be interrogated with open source software, and are intended to be. They lack the
sophistication of their datacentre elders, but for most queries, they are adequate. Where
privacy matters, there is no option.

                                              5
6.5    Software RAIDS

Any PC with three or more hard drives can be turned into a local backup solution. A
RAID is a configuration of hard drives that distributes the data of, for example, two drives
across three, such that if any single drive fails, its content can be reconstructed from data
on the other two. Linux achieves this through software instead of an expensive RAID
controller. In an enterprise environment, a RAID would be the middle level of a backup
solution, but for a small business, it could suffice, if two workersâ PCs were configured this
way. Inexpensive hardware is good enough; the network is the rate-limiting factor.

6.6    Turn-key Solutions

Small businesses (typically less than 10 employees) are eager to outsource their computing
needs to tech companies in order to save the salary of a system administrator. Yet, for many
of them, local turn-key solutions are adequate. For example, a credit-card sized computer
that costs 80â¬ is sufficient to provide (simultaneously) a cloud service, a web service and
kanban collaborative work environment â provided that the number of simultaneous users
remains low. Such a computer can be configured by volunteers. The operating system and
data are loaded on a micro SD card. It need only be inserted in the clientâs computer and
booted. In the event of SD card failure, it is simply replaced with a copy and brought up
to date from backups. In the case of hardware failure, the entire computer is replaced; the
cost of a service call in most cases exceeds the cost of the computer.

6.7    Compiled Software

Some programs are not part of a linux package manager because of the time and effort
required to meet the standards for a package â or any number of reasons. The programs
are then made available only on platforms like github, from where users may download
the source code and compile it themselves. For example, the voice-controlled AI assistant
mycroft can be installed only from github. Github is thereby a veritable Hadrianâs wall,
impenetrable to the wild and unprogramming hordes beyond it.
    The PC Corps can fill the gap. Having been certified a trustworthy entity, it could
compile such programs upon request and make the binaries thereafter available on its
servers.
