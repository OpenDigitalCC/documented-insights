     Response to the Call for Evidence on Open Digital Ecosystems

To the European Commission,

We welcome the Commission's initiative to set out a strategic approach to the open-source
sector in the European Union. This contribution responds to the call's focus on strengthening
the EU open ecosystem and reducing dependencies on non-EU countries in the digital sphere,
with particular attention to Questions 4 and 5 concerning technology prioritisation and sectors
that would benefit from increased open-source adoption.

Our submission proposes that open-source data infrastructure â the protocols and systems
that govern how data flows to and from AI systems â represents the most critical intervention
the EU could make to achieve technological sovereignty. Open-source models, tools, and
applications are valuable and should be supported. But without effective data infrastructure,
Europe will struggle to train frontier AI models due to limited data access under current
regulatory frameworks. Open-source, privacy-preserving data infrastructure can resolve this
constraint. And as a bonus, it can unlock high-value sectoral data for AI that no other jurisdiction
can yet access. This would bolster European sovereignty in two ways: enabling Europe to train
its own state-of-the-art models, and transforming European data into a sovereign asset.
Critically, this can be achieved by building technical infrastructure that reinforces existing data
protection and copyright principles.

The Strategic Opportunity: Why Frontier AI Is Not Trained in Europe

The call for evidence correctly identifies that the EU faces "significant dependence on non-EU
countries in the digital sphere" and that "much of the value generated by open-source projects is
exploited outside the EU." However, this framing understates the depth of the problem. The
issue is not merely that value flows abroad; it is that frontier AI development itself does not
occur in Europe.

No frontier model is trained primarily in the EU. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta
all train their largest models in the United States. Even Mistral, Europe's most prominent AI
company, trains its models outside the EU. This is not because European talent is lacking. It is
because data access in Europe is perceived as legally uncertain, fragmented across Member
States, and operationally complex.

GDPR has been foundational in conferring rights to EU citizens over their data. However, in
practice this has often led to a risk-averse culture in which organisations keep data locked
down, users have little practical autonomy over how their data is used, and beneficial uses of

                                                                                                       1
data go unrealised. European medical records, industrial data, financial transactions, scientific
research, and cultural archives remain locked in silos, unavailable to any AI system, European or
otherwise.

This creates an extraordinary strategic opportunity. The data that is currently inaccessible is
precisely the data that could enable breakthrough AI applications. No AI company can train on
European hospital data or European bank records or European manufacturing telemetry. But
European institutions could, if they had the infrastructure to do so in a privacy-preserving
manner.

The Infrastructure Gap: Data Infrastructure as the Missing Piece

The call for evidence focuses appropriately on open-source software, and the EU's investments
in open-source models, libraries, and frameworks are valuable. However, these investments will
not reach their full potential without complementary investment in the data infrastructure layer.
Europe's data protection framework means that the "collect data centrally, train models on that
data, deploy globally" approach used elsewhere is not viable here. This is not a weakness; it is
an opportunity to build something better.

What Europe needs is open infrastructure for how data flows to AI systems that is compatible
with European values by design. Rather than negotiating exemptions and exceptions to existing
rules, the EU can invest in infrastructure that makes privacy-preserving AI the default path. This
can transform regulatory compliance from a constraint into a competitive advantage.

This infrastructure would enable:

   ââ Hospitals to collaboratively train diagnostic AI without pooling patient data
   ââ Manufacturers to develop predictive maintenance models across supply chains without
      exposing trade secrets
   ââ Publishers and creators to participate in AI development while maintaining attribution
      and compensation
   ââ Researchers to train models on sensitive datasets that are currently completely
      inaccessible

The underlying technologies for this infrastructure already exist: federated learning, secure
multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, trusted execution
environments, and attribution-based control. These are already being deployed by trusted
European institutions. Eurostat's JOCONDE project is pioneering privacy-preserving techniques
for official statistics. Through the UN PET Lab, national statistics offices including Italy's Istat,
the Netherlandsâ CBS, and Switzerlandâs FSO are demonstrating cross-border collaboration
using these methods. The UN PET Guide and OECD recommendations recognise these
approaches as critical infrastructure for the data economy.

                                                                                                        2
These projects prove the approach works. The next step is establishing open protocols that
enable this technology to serve as shared, public-interest infrastructure. This would allow any
European organisation to adopt these methods, allowing European AI to flourish by drawing on
the collective knowledge of all Member States.

Response to Question 4: Technology Areas to Prioritise

The most important investment the EU could make is in open data protocols that enable
federated AI with attribution-based control. These protocols represent critical digital
infrastructure equivalent to internet protocols or the electrical grid.

Open Protocols for Privacy-Preserving Data Access

The EU should prioritise the development of open technology for:

   ââ Federated AI Networks: Open protocols and frameworks for enabling organisations to
      collaboratively train AI models while data remains at source. Multiple parties contribute
      to shared models without ever pooling underlying data. This approach is already proven
      in healthcare and statistical collaboration. The EU should mandate federated access as
      a baseline capability for all European Data Spaces.
   ââ Attribution-Based Control: Protocols enabling data owners to set and enforce terms
      over how their data is used by AI systems, with verifiable attribution at the point of
      output. This directly addresses the current tensions between AI developers and rights
      holders by providing a technical mechanism for ongoing control and compensation,
      rather than relying solely on legal remedies after the fact.

These technologies are not theoretical. For example, the open-source syft-flwr framework is
actively being deployed by European research institutions, including partners involved in Horizon
Europe-funded healthcare data initiatives. syft-flwr is designed for GDPR compliance, enabling
cross-border collaboration without centralising sensitive data, thereby directly addressing
European data sovereignty goals.

Why Open Data Protocols Are the Force Multiplier

Open protocols create a public utility that any organisation can build upon. Just as open
internet protocols enabled a diverse ecosystem of applications, open data protocols would do
the same for AI, eliminating the need for data brokers to sit in the middle and siphon off value.

The recent creation of the European Digital Infrastructure Consortium for Digital Commons
demonstrates recognition that collaborative frameworks are needed. Extending this effort to
data infrastructure would multiply the impact of existing open-source investments. Open
protocols for data access would enable open-source applications to reach their full potential by
giving them access to the high-value data they need.

                                                                                                    3
Response to Question 5: Sectors That Would Benefit

Healthcare: The Paradigm Case

Healthcare represents both the highest-value opportunity and the clearest illustration of the
current failure mode. European health data is among the world's most comprehensive and
high-quality. The forthcoming European Health Data Space represents an unprecedented
opportunity to leverage this data for medical AI.

Yet current approaches risk either centralising sensitive patient data in ways that create security
vulnerabilities and erode trust, or fragmenting access across Member States in ways that
prevent meaningful AI development. Recent research published in The Lancet Digital Health
proposes "federated personal health data spaces" that put citizens in control while enabling
secondary use through differential privacy and federated learning. The SHAIPED project,
launched in 2025, is already piloting AI-driven medical device development using federated
approaches.

With appropriate infrastructure, the EU could train diagnostic AI across all 27 Member States
without any patient data leaving its origin hospital. This would enable research on rare diseases
by combining data from small patient populations across Europe, and support personalised
medicine approaches that respect individual consent preferences.

Industrial Manufacturing and Supply Chains

European manufacturing leadership depends on predictive maintenance, quality control, and
supply chain optimisation. Manufacturers are reluctant to share operational data with AI
providers for fear of exposing trade secrets or competitive intelligence. This creates a collective
action problem: everyone would benefit from shared AI models, but no one wants to be the first
to share data.

Open privacy-preserving infrastructure resolves this by enabling collaborative AI without data
sharing. The GAIA-X initiative and Catena-X automotive data space already recognise the
importance of federated approaches. EU investment could accelerate these efforts and ensure
interoperability across sectors.

Scientific Research and Cultural Heritage

European research institutions and cultural archives hold irreplaceable data. Open infrastructure
with attribution-based control would enable cross-border research collaboration without
complex data transfer agreements, and allow AI systems to draw on Europe's rich cultural
archives while ensuring creators and rights holders maintain control over how their work is used
and are credited and remunerated when it is. This offers a viable path through the current
impasse between AI developers and the creative industries.

                                                                                                  4
The False Choice Between Innovation and Rights

The call for evidence frames the challenge as supporting open-source "while ensuring that EU
rules and values with regard to personal data, consumer protection, and competition law are
respected." This framing implies a tension that need not exist.

Privacy-preserving data infrastructure does not require weakening GDPR or other protections.
On the contrary, it implements GDPR's principles more fully by enabling data use without data
movement. When computation comes to the data rather than data going to computation, both
innovation and protection are achieved simultaneously.

This is the insight that should guide the EU's open-source strategy: Europe's regulatory
framework is not a barrier to AI leadership, it is a potential foundation for a different and better
kind of AI. By investing in open data infrastructure, Europe can catch up at the frontier by
enabling AI training on currently inaccessible high-value datasets, unlock breakthroughs in
healthcare, science, and industry by combining data that has never been combined before,
establish global standards that position European companies as leaders in responsible AI, and
achieve all of this without needing to water down its strong regulatory frameworks.

Specific Recommendations

We recommend the Commission consider:

   1.â Establish a European Open Data Infrastructure Initiative to fund development and
       deployment of open-source privacy-preserving data infrastructure, analogous to the Next
       Generation Internet (NGI) initiative but focused specifically on data protocols. Funding
       priority should be open protocols and reference implementations, not proprietary
       solutions or bespoke bilateral projects.â

   2.â Integrate privacy-preserving requirements into Data Space governance. All European
       Data Spaces should be required to support federated access as a baseline capability.
       Governance frameworks should incentivise privacy-preserving approaches through
       streamlined approval processes and regulatory clarity.â

   3.â Provide sustained funding for open-source foundations developing privacy-preserving
       infrastructure. This should not just be project-by-project grants but core funding for
       maintenance, community support, and developer fellowships.â

   4.â Coordinate at the European level. Data access protocols operate across borders by
       design. Having 27 different regulatory interpretations would undermine both their
       effectiveness and the Digital Single Market itself.â

                                                                                                  5
Conclusion

The EU stands at a crossroads. One path leads to continued dependence on non-EU
infrastructure, with European data either locked in silos or flowing to non-European AI systems
through terms dictated by foreign corporations. The other path leads to European leadership in
privacy-preserving AI â a model that the rest of the world may ultimately prefer to
surveillance-based alternatives.

The technology is ready. The strategic case is clear. What is needed now is the political will to
invest in open infrastructure that serves European values and interests.

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. We remain available to provide additional technical
details, concrete implementation examples, or assistance in developing specific policy language
for privacy-preserving data infrastructure provisions.
