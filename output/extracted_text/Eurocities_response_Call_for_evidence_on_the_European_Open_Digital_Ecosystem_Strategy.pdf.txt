_________________________________________________________________________________

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are the main barriers
that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source; and (ii) sustainable
contributions to open-source communities?
Strengths:
    â¢ Strong innovation ecosystem: availability of high-quality research base and talent; dialogue and
        collaboration between diverse stakeholders, e.g. public sector, private sector, academia, NGOs
        and the civil society.
    â¢ Alignment with key values: such as transparency, interoperability, digital sovereignty.
    â¢ Open-source solutions (OSS) can contribute to improved cost-efficiency and reduced vendor
        dependency, supporting technological autonomy and flexibility
    â¢ Cities acting as living labs: as the level of government closest to citizens and as providers of many
        services, cities can be ideal testbeds and further promote responsible OSS development and
        deployment, providing real-world environments in which open-source solutions can be tested,
        improved, and scaled.

Weaknesses:
   â¢ Fragmentation of the open-source ecosystems with uneven capacities across Member States,
      regions, cities and sectors, limiting scale and reuse.
   â¢ Limited awareness and trust: decision-makers may lack awareness and/or trust in open-source
      alternatives compared to well-established proprietary solutions.
   â¢ Insufficient maintenance/professional support of open source solutions may hinder their
      adoption by public administrations.
                      Eurocities contribution to the European Commissionâs call for evidence on the
                      upcoming European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy

Examples of barriers to adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source:
   â¢ For public authorities in particular: oftentimes insufficient funding; limited in-house expertise,
       skills gaps; uncertainty around support and accountability; perceived security risks; legal and
       procurement complexity; ecosystem complexity/dependencies.
   â¢ Challenges in scoping and assessing the maturity, security and relevance of open-source
       solutions; lack of sufficient support and guidance tailored to local realities.
   â¢ Need for more structured mechanisms to integrate city needs and feedback into EU-level
       initiatives: stronger involvement of cities in shaping EU frameworks, standards, and funding
       priorities could help ensure solutions are fit for purpose and deployable at local level.
            o In this context, the Digital Forum of Eurocitiesi,ii and the Living-in.EU movementiii,iv,
                 coordinated by Eurocities, aim to promote and facilitate open, interoperable digital
                 transformation that aligns with open-source principles at a policy and ecosystem level.

Examples of barriers to sustainable contributions to open-source communities:
   â¢ Legal and administrative uncertainty
   â¢ Insufficient resources / limited in-house expertise
   â¢ Limited institutional recognition / support
   â¢ Lack of sufficient recognition of public authorities not only as users but as co-developers

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please provide concrete
examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation, among others) that are
most important to assess the added value.
Open source can bring significant added value to both the public and the private sector. Cities are major
users, procurers, and increasingly co-developers of digital solutions, and their early and systematic
involvement in the development and deployment of OSS is essential to fully realise the potential of the
open source sector. From a city perspective, the added value of open-source technologies can include (and
is not limited to):
    â¢   Lower licensing and operational costs: open-source solutions can eliminate or significantly
        reduce proprietary licensing fees, contributing to a lower total cost of ownership.
    â¢   Avoiding vendor lock-in and increasing flexibility: by relying on open standards and open
        ecosystems, administrations can reduce dependency on single vendors and gain the ability to
        switch providers more easily.
    â¢   Transparency and security through auditability: when properly managed, open-source code can
        be openly inspected and audited, reducing the risk of hidden vulnerabilities or security issues.
    â¢   Accelerating innovation: collaboration with external communities, academia, industry, and
        other public bodies stimulates co-creation and faster innovation cycles. Open source can allow
        both the public and the private sector to reuse, adapt, and scale already developed solutions
        across borders, avoiding duplication of effort and fostering collaboration.
    â¢   Strengthening the local tech ecosystem: investments in open source solutions often translate
        into opportunities for local developers and companies, building long-term technological capacity
        within the region.
    â¢   Interoperability: ensuring systems can be integrated across departments, cities, and borders.
    â¢   Innovation and scalability: through reuse, adaptation, and cross-city collaboration.

                       upcoming European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the development and
growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and
cybersecurity agenda?
Eurocities is responding to this consultation as a city network. We have encouraged our members to
submit more detailed individual responses, but would like to offer the following general comments.
1) Cities as recognised partners in decision-making:
     â¢ The EU plays a major role in creating the enabling conditions for a strong, sustainable and secure
         open-source sector. Cities play a central role in deploying digital solutions and operating critical
         services, and their systematic involvement is essential to ensure that EU-level measures
         effectively contribute to technological sovereignty and cybersecurity.
    â¢   It is important that cities always have a seat at the table when decisions are made at the European
        level, in recognition of their key role in implementing EU policies and legislation. They should be
        actively involved in the decision-making process from the beginning, rather than only when it
        comes to implementation.
    â¢   Digital transformation requires high ambitions and investments, and bold coordinated efforts at
        all levels of governancev. Achieving the EUâs ambitions, will only be possible via collaboration at
        the EU, national, and local levels, requiring ambitious leadership and sustained investment.

2) Focus on practical and inclusive approaches and initiatives: the Strategy should prioritise practical
and inclusive approaches/mechanisms, which can be adapted to better reflect international, national and
local realities and addressing real urban challenges. It should facilitate further alignment between
strategies and priorities at all levels of governance, to avoid fragmentation or inconsistencies.
3) Provision of targeted funding for open source solutions development and maintenance: support to
public administrations and SMEs that choose to âgo the extra mileâ by contributing improvements back
to OSS projects.

4) Further promoting the use of open standards: ensuring interoperability lowers barriers to switching,
promotes competition, and enhances data portability across borders and systems.

5) Investment in training and capacity-building: offering EU-wide programs on OSS adoption, community
management, sustainable maintenance models, and best practices exchange.

6) Promotion of cross-border collaboration platforms: encouraging knowledge sharing and code reuse
across European cities and administrations.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
While there are numerous technological areas of key importance for Europeâs innovative transformation
and competitiveness, several areas should be particularly highlighted in the context of cities to further
strengthen competitiveness, resilience, and digital sovereignty:
    1. Urban data platforms and data governance technologies: can facilitate data-sharing aligned
       with European values and European data spaces, ensuring quality, security and reuse.
    2. Open and interoperable digital public services and platforms: can reduce vendor lock-in, scale
       proven solutions across cities, and lower costs through common standards and OSS.
    3. Digital twins and smart city platforms: can support various aspects of urban development (e.g.
       planning, mobility, climate adaptation, infrastructure optimisation, etc.) via real-time,
       interoperable models.

                          upcoming European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy

      4. Trustworthy, transparent and ethical AI technologies in areas of public value: compliant with
         EU rules and auditable by design, these technologies can support diverse areas of urban
         development and high-impact public use cases (e.g. mobility, energy, social services, etc.).
      5. Cybersecurity and cyber resilience: to protect critical services, infrastructures, supply chains.
      6. Focus on digital skills and collaboration platforms: to build local digital capabilities, accelerate
         co-creation, and reuse relevant components across borders.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased competitiveness and cyber
resilience?
Overall, increased use of open source solutions can lead to enhanced competitiveness and cyber
resilience by facilitating transparency, reducing dependencies, and contributing to a strong local digital
and cybersecurity ecosystem. While open source adoption could benefit diverse sectors, we would like
to particularly highlight several of them:
      â¢   Public administration: open source solutions support transparency, interoperability, and
          sovereignty, while contributing to improved resilience and long-term cost efficiency â key
          priorities for governments.
      â¢   Smart cities: open platforms enable easier integration of sensors, mobility solutions, and urban
          services, while stimulating local innovation.
      â¢   Education: open source solutions can further support learning, talent development and research
          collaborations, contributing to the development of the local workforce and long-term
          competitiveness; they can also reduce cost barriers.
