                        Cigref's contribution
             to the European Commission's consultation
                     on open digital ecosystems

Cigref, representing major French companies and public administrations, shares the Commission's
findings on the crucial role of Open Source Software (OSS) in digital resilience. For our members,
digital resilience is the ability to realistically control their future in order to secure their growth and
create sustainable value.

Cigref members make extensive use of open source components, particularly at the heart of their
infrastructures. However, these technologies are still under-represented in business software and
productivity applications, even though they offer significant potential for strengthening the
competitiveness of the European digital industry.

In this regard, Cigref has high expectations:

â Greater visibility for industrial-grade open-source solutions that are secure, interoperable,
compliant with European regulations and maintained over time (European strategic Magic
quadrant-type presentation)

â A long-term European open source industrial and technological strategy must cover the entire
software cycle, relying on active developer communities to maintain and evolve solutions according
to market needs. It must also provide for the organisation of development and a hosting
infrastructure for digital commons and open source solutions supported by the European Union or
Member States. The EDIC Digital Common could provide a suitable framework at European level,
provided that major public and private contractors are closely involved in its development.

â Acculturation to the mindset and use of open source

                                                                                                    Page 1 sur 3

â The emergence of world-class European champions to enable companies to consume open source
solutions as state-of-the-art, compliant and secure products.

Question 1 â Strengths, weaknesses and barriers to adoption and maintenance

In terms of strengths, OSS benefits from proven technical maturity, dynamic developer ecosystems
in Europe and a natural alignment with EU values (transparency, interoperability). It is the driving
force behind disruptive innovations (cloud, AI, big data).

In terms of weaknesses and barriers, there is a lack of visibility, which requires a catalogue of
industrial-grade solutions, such as the âEuropean Strategic Magic Quadrantâ.

    â¢   Strategic maturity: Less than half of organisations have an OSS strategy or an OSPO,
        hindering compliance and supply chain management.

    â¢   Fragmentation: Lack of EU-wide suppliers, fragmented funding and critical dependencies on
        platforms such as GitHub.

    â¢   Perception: Persistent concerns about security, compliance and the legal complexity of
        licences.

Question 2 â Added value of open source solutions for the public and private sectors

OSS guarantees control over dependencies and reversibility. Its transparency improves auditability
and cybersecurity (SBOM, provenance). Beyond innovation, it allows for the pooling of development
costs and promotes the creation of collaborative ecosystems rather than closed customer-supplier
relationships. Finally, it is a major lever for CSR (extending the life of equipment) and a key factor in
attracting talent for younger generations.

                                                                                                  Page 2 sur 3

Question 3 â Concrete measures at EU level to support the sector

Cigref recommends:

    1. A clear European governance involving end users to prioritise strategic building blocks.

    2. The industrialisation of the supply chain and support for the EDIC Digital Common as a
        framework for hosting digital commons.

    3. Support for an ecosystem of publishers and maintainers capable of transforming code into
        finished and secure products.

    4. The adaptation of public procurement practices to open source and the launch of large-scale
        training/acculturation programmes, starting in higher education.

Question 4 â Priority technology areas

Efforts must focus on areas that are highly critical and generate dependencies:

    â¢   AI and software engineering: The agent-based AI revolution must benefit the European
        open source development industry.

    â¢   Alternatives to monopolies: Support private/public co-financing initiatives or contribute to
        efforts to create alternatives to dominant software solutions (e.g. TOSIT's work).

Question 5 â Sectors where increased use can strengthen competitiveness and cyber resilience

While OSS is already at the heart of infrastructure, it must now establish itself in business software
and productivity applications. It is in this application segment, still dominated by non-European
proprietary solutions, that the greatest potential lies for strengthening the competitiveness and
sovereignty of the European digital industry.
