1) Executive message
    As an NGO of a Member State (PL) bringing together 30 members and representing the
community of specialists in the field of geographic information systems (GIS), we fully support
the initiative to strengthen the role of open source in the software used by EU institutions and
public administrations of Member States. This is a necessary step andâconsidering the maturity
of open source ecosystems and the scale and pace of the growth of the EUâs technological
dependencies on third countries such as the USA and Chinaâone that is at least a decade late.
Open source is already today a real alternative for many key, costly, and âclosedâ commercial
solutions. In current state of development, the EU does not have to bear the costs of creating
proprietary applications and systemsâthey already exist. It should primarily start quickly, in real
terms, to implement and scale âopenâ solutions, and economically support European companies
and economic entities providing development, integration and support for these solutions. Open
source code has no ânationalityâ and does not have to come from the EUâbut the jobs in
European companies providing IT support, taxes, competences and decision-making centers do.

2) Strengths and weaknesses of the open source sector in the EU and
   barriers to adoption and sustainable contribution
Strengths Strong base of competences and communities:

   â¢   The EU has some of the largest open source developer and user communities in the
       world: mature, stable products in many critical areas: operating systems (Linux),
       databases (PostgreSQL), GIS tools (QGIS, gvSIG), office suites (LibreOffice), graphics and
       engineering tools (GIMP, Inkscape, FreeCAD) and thousands of libraries and software
       components.
   â¢   Alignment with EU values: transparency, auditability, interoperability, avoidance of
       vendor lock-in and the ability to verify the software supply chain. Existing EU initiatives
       (e.g. NGI, FIWARE, investments in open hardware) â proven evidence that public support
       can deliver real results.

Weaknesses Fragmentation of deployments:

   â¢   Lack of common, practical standards and mutually compatible reference sets of software
       (system, office suite, communication tools) for institutions and administrations.

   â¢   Underfunding of maintenance: projects often grow thanks to the will of the community,
       but stable external and institutional mechanisms for maintenance, (pen)testing,
       documentation, UX and long-term hardening are missing.

   â¢   Unequal opportunities in public procurement: tender conditions are sometimes written
       for specific closed solutions (explicitly or in a hidden way), and not for functionality,

                                                                                       Page 2 of 8
      standards and the possibility of migration. Dependence on infrastructure outside the EU
      (repository platforms, clouds, CI/CD tools), which weakens the sovereignty of the
      ecosystem.

  â¢   Barriers to adoption and contribution Tenders and procurement law favoring âknown
      brandsâ, and not actual functionality, openness and interoperability;

  â¢   Long framework contracts entrenching vendor lock-in: The cost of migration and
      organizational change (training, processes, integrations, automations), which is often
      politically harder than the simple-easy-but-stupid annual ârenewal of licensesâ. Dead
      provisions on the requirement for open standards of data and documents in
      administration â if documents and systems circulate in closed formats, migration becomes
      artificially harder.

  â¢   The myth of âgreater security riskâ for open source: often repeated, even though in
      practice auditability, the speed of fixes and transparency of the supply chain work in favor
      of open solutions.

3) Added value of open source for the public and private sector â
   examples
  â¢   Cost and TCO: reduction of licensing costs and the ability to redirect budgets to local
      services of companies from the domestic EU market: implementations, maintenance,
      cybersecurity, training and development of competences.
  â¢   Reduction of lock-in and a real âexit optionâ: open formats, open interfaces, the
      possibility to change the support provider without replacing the entire platform.
  â¢   Cybersecurity and resilience: code auditability, bug bounting programs, product
      improvement cycle, easier implementation of security policies, possibility of own
      hardening, transparency of the supply chain, faster response to vulnerabilities.
  â¢   Innovation and competitiveness: open source shortens time to market, strengthens
      interoperability and allows competition by service and quality, and not by a closed format.

4) Specific âready todayâ examples (without the need for additional
   development funding â funding the transition and implementation is
   enough)
  â¢   Workstations and servers: stable Linux distributions with a long life cycle and strong
      backing (e.g. Debian and distributions developed and supported by European entities,
      such as SUSE / openSUSE or Ubuntu/Canonical).

                                                                                      Page 3 of 8
  â¢   Office suite: LibreOffice as a real alternative to MS Office (supported by The Document
      Foundation; open formats â ODF).

  â¢   GIS: QGIS as a real alternative to ESRI ArcGIS in a huge part of applications of
      administration and spatial planning.

  â¢   Databases: PostgreSQL as an alternative to commercial Microsoft or Oracle databases in
      many critical systems (performance, functionality, mature ecosystem).

  â¢   Graphics and multimedia: GIMP (an alternative to Photoshop in numerous office
      applications).

  â¢   Engineering / CAD: FreeCAD â increasingly real support for design processes, especially
      where a narrow set of proprietary functions is not required.

  â¢   Internet search engines: instead of fueling the business model of Google or Bing, use and
      develop privacy-focused European Qwant, Ecosia or distributed and open-source Web3
      solutions such as Presearch.

  â¢   Key observation: most of these projects matured without âmillions of eurosâ, driven by
      communities and limited resources. When the EU adds the scale of deployments,
      coordination, training and stable maintenance contracts to this, the potential is
      enormous.

5) Cost estimate (roughly, based on public price lists and reasonable
   assumptions)
  â¢   A âbusinessâ plan for purchasing commercial software from the USA in a subscription
      model: on the order of ~140 EUR / user / year.

  â¢   âEnterpriseâ (fuller functionality and security): on the order of ~450 EUR / user / year.

  â¢   EU scale: if we assume ~24 million âdigital workstationsâ in the broadly understood EU
      public administration (not every employee has an office workstation), then

  â¢   The annual cost of the only âWindows/Officeâ ecosystem alone is on the order of ~3â11
      billion EUR per year (depending on plans and discounts), and ~30â110 billion EUR over
      a 10-year horizon.

  â¢   In addition, large, costly server stacks (e.g. commercial databases) and specialist tools
      (e.g. GIS) should be added, which also generate significant costs in the public sector.
  Conclusion: even after taking into account the costs of migration, training and process
  adjustments, the EU has real space to redirect (and not only âsaveâ) billions of euros per
  year from licenses and lock-in to the European IT services market.

                                                                                       Page 4 of 8
6) What specific actions at the EU level can support the open source
   sector and technological sovereignty as well as cybersecurity?
  â¢   A - âOpen source / open standards firstâ â hard procurement rules:
      i) Requirement of open standards (especially document and data formats) in
           administration and projects financed from EU funds.
      ii) âOpen Source Firstâ principle in public procurement: closed solutions only when there
           is a documented justification (functional, legal or security) and a migration plan.
      iii) Mandatory âexit planâ for critical systems: requirements for data portability,
           interoperability and the ability to change the supplier.

  â¢   B - Common European baseline and migration support:
      i) System profiles for EU institutions and administrations (e.g. a reference Linux
           distribution/stack for desktops and servers and a set of applications: office suite,
           email, communicator, web browser, collaboration tools, GIS software), which will be
           covered by EU development support.
      ii) Migration and training program (fund + ready materials, e-learning, certifications,
           âtrain-the-trainerâ).
      iii) Library of implementation practices: ready system images, security policies,
           integration patterns with user directories, qualified signature, eID, etc.

  â¢   C - Open source supply chain security â a systemic approach:
      i) Program for mapping critical dependencies (critical dependencies) and funding
           audits, tests, bug bounty and hardening.
      ii) Requirement of SBOM and security practices in projects financed and purchased by
           the public sector.
      iii) Building/maintaining European production infrastructure (repositories, CI/CD,
           signing of artifacts) for critical components.

  â¢   D â Mobility and mobile solutions:
      i) The weakest link of dependence on the USA is practically dependent on the US mobile
           ecosystems (iOS / Android).
      ii) This does not mean a lack of possibilities for actionâit means the need for priority,
      iii) Strong support for European initiatives of devices and the âservice layerâ
           (e.g. Fairphone) and solutions based on the open part of Android (AOSP).
      iv) Support for creating a European, trusted app store for public services and
           applications compliant with EU requirements (without dependence on Google
           Mobile Services).
      v) Requirement that publicly funded applications (especially for public services) be
           possible to build and verify from the provided complete source code and be based on
           open standards.

                                                                                   Page 5 of 8
7) Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and the INSPIRE ecosystem: a
   focused opportunity for fast, visible impact
    We recommend that this initiative explicitly addresses software for managing geospatial
information, in close connection with the INSPIRE Directive and the broader EU spatial data
infrastructure.
   GIS tools are embedded in many everyday public tasksâspatial planning, infrastructure
management, environmental protection, municipal services, emergency and crisis management,
and more. At the same time, many public institutions currently spend very large amounts on
proprietary, licensed GIS products (e.g. enterprise platforms from vendors such as ESRI or
Hexagon). These costs can directly limit the scale of GIS use, the pace of service improvements,
and the funds that remain for actual public needs.
    In the GIS domain, vendor lock-in can become particularly deep and long-lasting because it is
often reinforced simultaneously through data models, geodatabases, styling/cartography assets,
integration patterns, and organization-wide workflowsânot only through file formats. Over time,
this can make switching solutions harder and increase costs.
Prioritising open source GIS in the public sector can therefore deliver practical, domain-specific
benefits:

   â¢   More resilient interoperability in practice: open solutions typically rely on widely adopted
       open standards and interfaces, which supports cross-institution workflows and INSPIRE-
       aligned data and services.
   â¢   Greater control and verifiability: institutions can better understand and verify how critical
       tools work, which supports trust, security and quality assurance.
   â¢   Lower long-term costs with more room for public value: budgets can be shifted from
       recurring license fees towards European service delivery (deployment, integration,
       training, maintenance, and security).
Concrete, GIS-specific actions the EU could support include:

   â¢   Procurement and evaluation guidance tailored to GIS: guidance and model clauses that
       assess full long-term costs and portability (data/workflows), and that avoid automatically
       favouring a single vendor where open source solutions meet functional needs.
   â¢   Migration enablement through pilots and reusable playbooks: structured pilots, practical
       implementation guidelines, and reusable examples (templates, reference architectures,
       lessons learned) that other institutions can adopt with low effort.
   â¢   Targeted funding for maintenance, reliability and security of critical open source GIS
       components: supporting the long-term upkeep, testing, documentation, and security
       hardening of the most important building blocks used by administrations.
   â¢   Reusable public-sector GIS modules: promoting shareable components that public
       institutions can jointly develop and reuse (e.g. common tools for publishing maps and

                                                                                        Page 6 of 8
       geospatial services, data quality and validation utilities, and integration elements), so that
       the same work is not duplicated in many places.
    Because GIS is so widely used across public administration, a clear EU priority for open source
GIS would translate into fast and measurable effects: lower long-term costs, reduced dependency
on single vendors, easier data sharing between institutions, and more agility in improving public
services.
    In Poland, a non-governmental organization focused on open source GIS is active: QGIS Poland
Association (https://qgis.pl/). According to its statute, the associationâs goals include, among
others, promoting and supporting open standards for GIS data and open source geoinformatics
software, as well as cooperation with public institutions, companies, non-governmental
organizations, and educational and research organizations. The association also seeks to share
knowledge and support education and research based on open GIS and related projects, including
through events, trainings and information activities.
    QGIS Poland Association is ready to cooperate with the EU and public institutions in this area
by sharing practical experience, helping prepare guidelines and reusable examples for
administrations, supporting trainings and awareness-raising activities, and supporting wider use
of open source GIS in public services.

                                                                                         Page 7 of 8
Conclusion:
     The EU needs hard targets, and fast implementation and not only declarations. For the
initiative to be effective, it must move from âencouragingâ to specific fast (and not sluggish, such
as e.g. the actual time of introducing USB-C) commitments and indicators:

   â¢   Mandatory use of open standards in documents and data in the public sector.

   â¢   Treat GIS as a flagship domain for measurable impact: include GIS explicitly among
       high-priority software areas where open source adoption can reduce costs and
       dependency quickly.

   â¢   Requirement of lock-in exit plans for critical systems: provide model procurement
       language and evaluation criteria that account for long-term costs (TCO), portability, and
       an enforceable exit plan (data + workflows + integrations).

   â¢   Promote reusable GIS building blocks for administrations: encourage shared, open
       source modules and components that institutions can co-develop and reuse, reducing
       duplication and accelerating service improvements.
   â¢   Fund migration, training, and institutional readiness: support pilots, training
       programmes and reusable implementation blueprints for moving from proprietary GIS
       stacks to open alternatives.
   â¢   Invest in maintenance and security of critical open source geospatial components:
       create stable mechanisms (contracts and targeted funding) that enable reliable
       maintenance, testing, documentation, and security hardening.

    Without this, the EU will remain on a short, and still quickly shortening leash (see Googleâs
current plans to increasingly close this system to third-party applications) of technology suppliers
from the USA, China, India â and will pay for this dependence with enormous public resources.
This is not only a cost â it is a strategic, even existential, risk, when by a political decision of one
of the countries (e.g. the USA) the EU is cut off from an entire range of IT systems. European
digital sovereignty must start from the foundations: systems, data, tools and competences.
