Dear DG CNECT,

This is my personal view on the aspects of sovereignty and regulatory compliance of open source software.

Sovereignty
Free / Open source code (hereinafter FOSS1) is, in its very nature, sovereignty preserving.

Even when an FOSS project has the vast majority (or even the entirety) of their development outside of the EU,
their effort still exist globally. It cannot be withdrawn, it cannot be un-opened in ways that matters. Even if the
entire team decides to change the license and close the source (or abandon the project) â the project up to and
including that moment is still available, and development can continue by other contributors from that point on.

The rules around closed source projects owned by companies therefore do not apply to FOSS. A commercial
company has a place of incorporation, executives and a board that has to work within the legal framework of a
particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. FOSS projects might have a BDFL 2 who makes all of the important decisions
about the projects â and yet even a projectâs BDFL cannot decide to take away access to the projectsâ source back
from the people who use it or the developers who work on it. An FOSS project can always be forked and
developed alternatively elsewhere, as already happened multiple times 34567. They would not cut access due to the
whims of a demented dictator.

Regulatory framework
This means that FOSS has to have its own, separate framework to commercial software. The location of FOSS
software is global. Non-EU contributors are still contributing to a project used in the EU, and simultaneously EU
contributors contributions are used outside of the EU. Since development is transparent â itâs difficult (although
not entirely impossible8) for a foreign actor to hurt a project.

The regulatory framework applicable to commercial software can but doesnât necessarily match FOSS projects.
Many contributors are simply not interested in complying with local regulations or regulations that are
incompatible with their personal desires. I believe that the solution is to develop a framework that will adopt
projects and contribute to them so that they become compatible with EU regulations. For example, EU 2024/2847 9
- this way money saved by using the development acumen of open source programmers for âfreeâ can be used to
elevate the quality of the project and allow it to be compliant in the EU software ecosystem. This can be done by
contributing money to the project, or injecting EU paid developers into the project that will perform those
compliance tasks.

The ability to contribute the compliance tasks to open source projects can be a powerful instrument in creating a
health(-er) open source ecosystem and also substantiate leadership in the world-wide regulatory domain.
