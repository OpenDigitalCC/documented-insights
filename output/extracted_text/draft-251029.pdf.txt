                                                Abstract
           Medical imaging technologies are fundamental to modern healthcare, yet their availability
       across the European Union and globally remains uneven, with significant gaps in remote and
       resource-limited regions. Recent advances in open-source magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
       and ultrasound systems have demonstrated that complex diagnostic equipment can be collab-
       oratively developed to achieve clinically meaningful image quality. These open technological
       frameworks have already informed the design of certified medical devices, underscoring the
       effectiveness of transparent, cooperative innovation in addressing urgent clinical needs.

Access to medical technology and the open-source paradigm
Medical imaging technologies are fundamental tools for early detection, accurate diagnosis, and
effective treatment of various medical conditions. Due to the high cost of ownership, lack of
qualified staff, and intellectual property (IP) protection of technical details related to maintenance
and repair, their distribution and use in countries around the world is significantly limited (WHO,
n.d.), especially for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Figure 1 highlights the striking disparities in this distribution across the European Union, with
differences of up to a sevenfold lower number of machines depending on the member state.

As a result, restricted access to crucial diagnostic services hinders early disease detection and
treatment with all its consequence in terms of patient health and increased costs for the healthcare
systems (McGarvey et al. 2022).

Therefore, improving access to medical imaging technologies has become a top priority for the
relevant communities (ISMRM 2019, 2024; Wilson et al. 2019; World Health Organization 2023;
Fleming et al. 2021).

https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?oldid=280129

Current solutions to this problem require heavy investments in devices, infrastructure and training,
which however are also the source of the problem itself. More recently, collaborative initiatives
based on open-source medical technologies have begun to emerge, offering a different yet promising
approach to improving resource eï¬iciency across public healthcare systems in the European Union
and globally (Winter et al. 2019).

Open-source refers to a development and IP scheme where material is made available for anyone
to study, use, modify and (re-)distribute â free of charge, non-exclusively, and irrevocably. For
open-source software (OSS), this means that its source code is available under licenses granting
those rights (Open Source Initiative 2006; âWhat Is Free Software? - GNU Project - Free Software
Foundationâ n.d.); for hardware, the complete technical documentation must be made available
under equivalent terms (âOpen Source Hardware - Part 1: Requirements for Technical Documen-
tationâ 2020). This paradigm of free information flow enables a low-threshold global collaboration
on technological commons.

Today, there is strong evidence that open-source constitutes the dominant development model in
the software domain. OSS is contributing â¬65-95 billion annually to the EU economy (Directorate-
General for Communications Networks et al. 2021), and up to $8.8 trillion globally (Hoffmann,
Nagle, and Zhou 2024).

OSS is established and ubiquitous, and its positive impact on lower income countries is being
increasingly recognized (Living Open Source Foundation 2024).

                                                 2
These trends are also diffusing into the medical domain, where certified medical software on an
open-source basis becomes available1 .

Similar to software, open-source hardware (OSH) development is primarily community-driven,
taking place in online environments that facilitate large-scale collaboration under the absence of
restrictive IP policies (Moritz, Redlich, and Wulfsberg 2018). OSH bears the potential to achieve
faster and more cost-eï¬icient development cycles compared to proprietary hardware, partly due to
network effects and strong participatory elements (Heikkinen et al. 2020).

The cost savings alone can range around e.g., 90 % for lab equipment, compared to proprietary
equivalents (Pearce 2020), whereby a resilient manufacturability is at the very heart of the con-
cept of OSH (Hassan, Mies, and Jochem 2023). Similarly, a study published by the European
Commission has quantified the costâbenefit ratio of open-source technologies at over 1:4. With
appropriate investment, open-source may be rapidly recognized as a key enabler â not only for
resilient and accessible technologies, but also as a significant contributor of Europeâs GDP growth
and ICT start-up ecosystem (Directorate-General for Communications Networks et al. 2021).

Yet, OSH appears to be primarily driven by volunteer- or research-led communities, with industry
participation and market capitalization still significantly lower than in the OSS domain. OSH did
not only emerge about 20 years later than OSS, but also scales slower. An obvious explanation
for this are physical limitaions: OSS operates entirely in the digital realm, allowing easy copying,
modification, and distribution at minimal cost. In contrast, OSH involves creating physical arti-
facts from digital designs, which requires physical production, making updates, modifications, and
distribution far more diï¬icult and costly. As a result, OSH designs tend to persist longer, develop-
ment is slower and more expensive, and more dependent on precise and complete documentation
(Malinen et al. 2010).

In particular for the development of medical technologies, documentation standards and best prac-
tices are therefore key to being able to transition community driven hardware prototypes into fully
functional safe and certified medical products released and distributed by companies.

In contrast to consumer hardware markets, where open designs are often viewed as a competi-
tive disadvantage in private investment-driven environments, medical hardware offers compelling
incentives for adopting an open-source strategy.

A simple and good example is the open-source glia stethoscope. It can be produced with locally
available materials and tools at about 1.7 % of the costs of an equally performant commercial
model (Pavlosky et al. 2018).

Supporting and investing in open-source hardware and its infrastructure for critical medical tech-
nologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound, offers a high return on investment in
the form of sustainable long-term cost savings for public healthcare systems across the European
  1 openEMR provides an example for medical record software, https://www.open-emr.org accessed 2025-10-

Union and objective evaluations of the clinical performance of these devices (Moritz et al. 2019;
Winter et al. 2019).

In order to realize such vision the following implementations are needed:

  1. Public funding mechanisms to support technological base developments and technical docu-
     mentations according to regulatory standards
  2. Independent organizations for community building, community support and the dissemina-
     tion of technology and best practices according to the envisioned goal of developing medical
     hardware
  3. Industry partnerships to invest and transition these OSH developments into products

While point (1) and (3) requires the realization of dedicating public funding schemes in collabo-
ration with industry, point (2) can naturally grow, as in the case of the Open Source Imaging
Initiative (OSIÂ²), out of the community specialized in a particular application.

Open-source medical imaging

The Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSIÂ²) traces its roots to 2016, when a group of scientists and
supporters realized the importance of pursuing open-source MRI technology as a sustainable way to
provide worldwide accessibility to medical imaging. Sharing the IP related to MRI technology not
only removes one barrier to its adoption in lower resource countries, but has already expanded the
research collaborations among different areas of expertise in the international community (Winter
et al. 2024). In 2022, this effort led to the creation of the first open-source Low Field MRI scanner,
the OSIÂ² ONE v1.0.0 (OâReilly 2022; Winter 2022), as shown below in Figure 2.

Figure 2: The OSIÂ² ONE v1.0.0 MRI Low Field scanner built in 2022 with an example of acquired
in-vivo brain image from (Schote et al. 2025)

The OSIÂ² ONE scanner has been successfully constructed in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria
as well as in lower and middle resource regions such as Uganda, Paraguay and South Africa,
demonstrating both the scope and applicability of the OSIÂ² mission. Further builds are ongoing
within Europe in the UK, Finland, Italy, Turkey, the Czech Republic and globally in India, Nepal
and the USA.

                                                  4
Development of a new fully characterized version of the open-source MRI scanner, aiming for
an easy transition to clinical deployment, is continuing within the European EURAMET project
A4IM (EURAMET, n.d.). Its aim is to have the complete image generation pipeline, from the
programming of the imaging techniques, through the hardware transmission and datasampling
hardware, till the image reconstruction and post-processing workflow, transparent and open-source.
These efforts furthermore include documentation blueprints of the system required by the European
medical device regulation (MDR EU 2017/745).

First in-vivo brain images of hardware and software components developed within this project look
promising (Schote et al. 2025) and are already being used by SMEs for product development. These
companies actively contribte to the public repositories - an important step towards establishing an
open-source ecosystem around the developed technologies, where industry participation is essential
to realize their full potential.

While open-source developments can be initiated and funded through research projects, there is
a need for an independent body to coordinate these efforts across the global community, ensure
their continuation beyond the projectâs lifetime, and maintain high standards of documentation
and quality.

Consequently, in 2024 the international non-profit association the Open Source Imaging Initiative
e.V. (incorporated in Germany) was founded to achieve the following goals:

   â¢ funding development and dissemination of open-source imaging technologies through dona-
      tions and grants;
   â¢ guiding others in utilizing and rebuilding open-source imaging solutions;
   â¢ developing robust documentation blueprints for regulatory approval;
   â¢ acquiring and managing assets on behalf of the community;
   â¢ providing infrastructure, including workshops and digital platforms;
   â¢ growing and sustaining our global community of developers and users;
   â¢ achieving our vision of open-source medical technology.

While OSIÂ² currently focuses on MRI as its pilot technology to establish a blueprint for complex
medical devices, its scope also encompasses other imaging modalities, including ultrasound and
CT.
Ultrasound in particular, has received significant open-source contributions over the past years
(Jonveaux et al. 2022; Taylor, Jonveaux, and Caskey 2017) with many of these efforts being used
and translated into a fully certified medical device 2 .

These individual examples demonstrate the value of open-source developments for clinical prac-
tice, yet a systematic approach is needed to establish an ecosystem around open-source medical
technologies.

Conformity Assessment Body
In contrast to OSS, OSH cannot be replicated with a single click; each reproduction requires a
tangible investmentânot only in time, but also in materials and associated costs.

In practice, the quality of documentation varies considerably, and even the term open-source
hardware is often misused or applied without reference to a clear definition.

To address this issue, several open-source communities including OSIÂ² collaborated on the develop-
ment of the standardization document DIN SPEC 3105, which defines (1) a set of minimum criteria
that a project must meet to qualify as open-source hardware, and (2) a decentralized conformity
assessment scheme providing independent attestations of documentation quality (Bonvoisin et al.
2020; âOpen Source Hardware - Part 1: Requirements for Technical Documentationâ 2020; âOpen
Source Hardware - Part 2: Community-Based Assessment; Text in Englishâ 2020).

As a next step, OSIÂ² has established a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) in accordance with DIN
SPEC 3105-2, ensuring consistent application of open-source principles and sustained documenta-
tion quality within the field of medical imaging (OSII e.V., n.d.). The OSIÂ² CAB is responsible
for reviewing open-source projects submitted to OSIÂ², issuing a report and assigning a score to the
reviewed project3 .

The report and the score helps developers to improve the quality and completeness of the project
documentation and users to assess its replicability. At this stage, the review process does not aim
to provide any evaluation of the technical quality and usefulness of a specific project, but rather
to:

      â¢ ensure that IP rights suï¬iciently grant the four rights of open-source, so that anyone to study,
         modify, make and distribute (including to sell) the technology (âOpen Source Hardware - Part
        1: Requirements for Technical Documentationâ 2020);
      â¢ assess the quality and completeness of the provided documentation, so that those rights can
         be practically executed;
      â¢ assess the dependency of the project on proprietary third party components;
      â¢ assess the ease and feasibility of reproducing the project.

The CAB review workflow4 is inspired by the peer review process adopted by scientific journals.
Each project is reviewed by at least two independent reviewers and the review report is publicly
accessible within the CAB repository (OSII e.V., n.d.). When the review process is completed
and if the project complies with minimum open-source requirements, it is uploaded to the OSIÂ²
website5 , a DOI is associated with the reviewed version of the project, the review report is uploaded
to the CAB repository (OSII e.V., n.d.) and an attestation is issued (Figure 3).

Figure 3: OSIÂ² CAB attestation logo. The overall tier is represented by the number of stars. The
review number provides a unique identifier for each assessment and the checklist version clearly
identifies the version of the list of criteria applied for the assessment. Each revision can be accessed
in the public OSIÂ² CAB repository (OSII e.V., n.d.).

A project is associated to a specific tier according to the number of points scored during the review
process. This score is based on a checklist of items, defined in accordance with DIN SPEC 3105-1
(âOpen Source Hardware - Part 1: Requirements for Technical Documentationâ 2020). Some of
these items are mandatory to obtain the attestation while others represent an added value. The
CAB repository (OSII e.V., n.d.) provides two different checklists which apply to software-based
and hardware-based projects. If a submitted project includes both software and hardware parts,
both checklists are applied. Projects that meet the minimum criteria (Tier 1) are also eligible for
a certificate from the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA)6 ; the further tiers go beyond
the OSHWA criteria.

In addition to the number of stars, the logo in Figure 3 also reports the checklist version and a
review number which unambiguously identifies the reviewed project. The former number is useful
for keeping track of future revisions of the checklists and the latter ensures a logo (as well as the
underlying assessment report) is unique for each reviewed project and version.

Once the documentation quality of the projects matures over time through support of the CAB
attestation, additional scores and tiers will be added to the process, which will include e.g. technical
documentation as required by the Medical Device Regulation EU 20217/745 such as: Intended
use and classification rationale, General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs), Risk
Management or product verification and validation according to internatioanl standards (e.g. IEC
60601-1). This will help to clearly distinguish the quality of open-source projects and their readiness
for transfer into clinical practice, creating an important publicly available source of blueprints that
can be adopted to a variety of similar, also proprietary, medical products.

Conclusion
While medical imaging devices represent a cornerstone of modern healthcare, their availability
remains limited â both within Europe and, even more significantly, on a global scale.

The open-source paradigm offers a promising path to address this disparity by enabling collabora-
tive development of medical devices. Through transparent information exchange â from technical
design to regulatory documentationâthis approach fosters stronger collaboration, more eï¬icient
use of resources, and ultimately cost reductions for public healthcare systems.

Initial demonstrations have shown that complex, functional open-source prototypes such as MRI
scanners can indeed be realized. Regulatory documentation for these systems is currently underway,
and first steps are being taken to scale these efforts through the establishment of documentation
standards coordinated by independent organizations such as OSIÂ² e.V.

To expand and accelerate this progress, dedicated funding mechanisms and investment in pilot
projects are essentialâprojects that clearly demonstrate the benefits of open-source approaches
for patients and healthcare systems alike. In this way, open-source medical imaging evolves from
idealism into a structured, sustainable ecosystem that delivers tangible value to both patients and
healthcare providers.
