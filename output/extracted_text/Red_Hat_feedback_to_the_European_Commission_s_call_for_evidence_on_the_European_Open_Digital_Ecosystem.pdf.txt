Red Hat feedback re. European Commissionâs call for evidence on the European Open
Digital Ecosystem

                                                                      Brussels, 3 February 2026

                                       *** SECTION I ***

Red Hat, the worldâs leading provider of open source solutions (see graphic 1), uses a
community-driven model to deliver high-performing Linux, cloud, automation, container, and
Kubernetes technologies, as well as open source AI frameworks that power the full machine
learning lifecycle. Though a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM since 2019, Red Hat operates as a
distinct legal entity, maintaining neutrality to serve as a catalyst for open innovation across
the global hybrid cloud.

                        Graphic 1: Red Hatâs community driven portfolio

Our "upstream-first" development model (see graphic 2) ensures that we do not merely
consume open source code but actively harden, secure, and contribute back to the global
projects that power the modern digital economy. Instead of "forking" code into proprietary
silos - which creates technical debt and incompatibility - we submit every bug fix, security
patch, and feature enhancement to the community repository first.

                                                                                                           1

                    Graphic 2: Red Hatâs Open Source upstream first model

This model represents one of the largest R&D budgets in industry, as a percentage of
revenue, and is recognised by numerous academic research as key to optimising a secure,
stable and standardised public good for all. Moreover, this model significantly helps address
the viability/sustainability of the open source ecosystem. Red Hatâs "upstream first" model is
closely aligned to Europe as a global powerhouse of open source talent and thus hosting our
largest research and development hub due to the high-skilled contributors in the EU and with
thousands of employees across the EU.

Europe has a long history of initiating projects that scale into global success stories - such as
the Linux kernel in Finland, cURL in Sweden, Python in the Netherlands. By engaging in these
projects without geographical silos, European based developers together with the developers
around the world ensure that local and internationally-focused companies across Europe can
harness this largely public good - valued at over â¬8.8 trillion - turning raw community
innovation into world-class enterprise-grade solutions.

At Red Hat, we unlock the world's potential by fueling a meritocracy where the best ideas can
come from anywhere, creating better technology the open source way.

                                       *** SECTION II ***

We strongly support the EUâs âdefault to openâ regulatory posture and wish to share some
ideas in this open source consultation. For decades, Red Hat has worked closely with the EU
to open up and modernise its IT ecosystem with ever more open source adoption and

                                                                                                               2
                                                                             Ref. Ares(2026)1148378 - 03/02/2026

contribution coupled with developing public policy which helps support this open trajectory in
Europe.

By way of example, DG Digitâs Open Source Strategy, in 2003, was a key policy initiative
which, at the time, opened the door to Red Hatâs Linux replacing Microsoft as the operating
system for the EU institutions. The ensuing iterations and growing appetite in this Open
Source Strategy represents an important chapter in the growth of open source in the
continent. The EU also uses Red Hatâs proven stability and enterprise grade performance to
further encourage more open source adoption throughout the stack. This has become a point
of pride for the company and core to our mission - âto be the catalyst in communities of
customers, contributors and partners creating better technology the open source wayâ.

This upcoming EU Communication will update and absorb DG Digitâs Open Source strategy
(6th iteration) and thereby offers another exciting opportunity for open source to replace yet
more proprietary offerings as well as force more interoperability hygiene from closed source
solutions. Moreover, the recent EU cloud tender framework (October, 2025) recognises the
power of open source and the importance of providers like Red Hat to play a full role in this
next chapter of IT modernisation within the EU so as to both accelerate IT modernisation and
realise digital sovereignty in Europe.

The upcoming Communication will also influence future EU legislative packages expected in
March/April of this year and thus provides an important opportunity to recognise some of the
key success factors to the EUâs approach to opening up its ecosystem and ways in which to
further accelerate ongoing modernisation on the basis of the following pillars:

(i) embrace open source business models (e.g. upstream-first) which focus on business
solutions whilst incentivising upstream bug fixes and functionality improvements as well as
ecosystem sustainability;

(ii) use/adherence to mature and established open source licenses, high-hygiene open
standards and governance structures which guarantee customers sovereign control over their
IT and modernisation journey;

(iii) bolster default-to-open policy approach to EU regulation and funding of key areas - such
as cybersecurity, AI, modernisation and R&D - thereby reflecting core Open Source Freedoms
which deliver sovereignty as an overarching objective.

During the recent EU open source week (26/1 - 2/2), a consensus was audibly evident among
open source practitioners and organisations: the strength of open source is inseparable from
its global, borderless nature. Open source does not adhere to national borders (see graphic 3)

                                                                                                             3
                                                                                 Ref. Ares(2026)1148378 - 03/02/2026

nor create dependencies but, rather, mutually reinforcing intra dependencies where global
collaboration can channel scarce resources to real problems and opportunities. By virtue of its
unique âcommoditisationâ value (i.e. components and solutions which are developed and
re-used in all public or private verticals) it also does not lend itself to be regarded as a
particular sector nor belonging to a particular region or country.

Policies thus potentially based on a "Made in X" geographic principle risk being incompatible
with the open source model. As such restrictions could inadvertently limit European
innovation and participation in the very communities that drive IT modernisation and the
realisation of digital sovereignty in Europe (as well as other parts of the world). A growing
trend, amongst practitioners, seems to suggest a shift from âmade inâ to âcontributed byâ.
Perhaps the growth of EU contribution to open source and vertical intensity could be annually
measured in DESI as a metric of innovation and improve political awareness of its underlying
strength to solve challenges that no single country or organisation or region can solve alone.

                                      (source: Github, 2025)

As also evident across several panels during EU open source policy summit (30/1/26) and
subsequent Fosdem weekend, a proposed "buy European" requirement - if applied to open
source - must be carefully considered. Notably, imposing geographical restrictions on a global
technology base risks limiting the choice of world-class open source components or solutions
available to European enterprises. The open source license provides access to the software in

                                                                                                                 4

perpetuity, granting customers the freedom to audit, switch vendors, and control their IT
journey regardless of the vendor's headquarters or origin of the code. As one leading
European IT vendor CEO warned: a âbuy europeanâ requirement risks detracting from the
emphasis being on âopen-source firstâ as the way to accelerate modernisation and guarantee
sovereignty in Europe.

                                     *** SECTION III ***

Herewith our proposed feedback with regards to the five questions posed by the call for
evidence.

                                              ***

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open source sector? What are the
main barriers that hamper adoption and sustainable contributions?

Strengths:

ââ Europeâs core strength lies in its high density of excellent open source developers.
    Indeed, Red Hat being a good example of that with its globally largest R&D center in the
    EU;
ââ The EUâs default-to-open policy posture (e.g. Copyright Directive, CRA, AI act, and, IEA
    as well as OSS strategy and Horizon) helps better align the legal and practical needs of
    the open source ecosystem when it comes to a complex package of multiple EU policy
    initiatives;
ââ By way of example, the ongoing close co-operation between DG Connect and the open
    source ecosystem within the CRA implementation (guidance and standards) provides an
    additional level of operational, technical and legal understanding as well as the
    importance of contribution upstream (such as an upstream-first model) being key to
    bolstering cybersecurity resilience;
ââ There is also growing political understanding (e.g. Berlin declaration and BSI/ANSSI joint
    implementation) as to the role of open source to realise digital sovereignty - i.e. genuine
    choice of IT and underpinning transparency/auditability to ensure full EU legal
    compliance;
ââ Europe also has already a fast growing open source business across all key European
    verticals upon which to build on. Curiously, however, the call for evidence talks about the
    open success in âthe last few yearsâ. In response to your request, we have thus provided
    several examples of this open source success from both the public and private sectors,
    across Europe, in response to question 2, below.

                                                                                                             5
                                                                               Ref. Ares(2026)1148378 - 03/02/2026

Weaknesses:

ââ Public Sector Rigidity: in the public sector, there is often a lack of clarity on how to
    participate (e.g. employment contracts). Bureaucracy often makes it difficult for public
    employees to get approval to contribute time or code back to communities.
ââ Equating "sovereignty" with "autarky" continues to be a risk amongst some politicians
    given the current geo-politics: policies that potentially focus on the geographic origin of
    code rather than the practical availability of the source code and the rights afforded by
    the open source licensing (inspection, modification, right to exit) misunderstand the
    nature of open source software supply chains;
ââ Such an approach would likely create barriers to open innovation thereby forcing
    European integrators and manufacturers to fork global projects and thus (unnecessarily)
    increase maintenance costs and sever collaborative ties with global innovation and
    fast-paced communities. It would also impact Europeâs globally operating companies
    who would, presumably, risk being required to run several IT systems which leads to
    higher costs and lower resilience.
ââ Finally, any potential geographical or nationality limitation conflicts with the main
    licensing principles of open source which does not allow for such restrictions - the best
    ideas come from everywhere. Such a requirement would not only face practical
    challenges to monitor/police but also likely have a chilling effect on the involvement of
    European developers who cherish and passionately defend the core open source
    freedoms.

Barriers:

ââ The Communicationâs focus, thus, has to be much more on current and future policy
   barriers which hamper EU governments and companies to use open source and contribute
   open source upstream. Herewith some examples of barriers which need to be urgently
   tackled in this communication:
   â â Address liability conditions and/or indemnification clauses in procurement or funded
      projects which are typical in a proprietary setting. These are antithetical to open
      source licensing and long-established open source collaboration which permits
      developers from using / contributing / deploying open source code;
   â â More specifically, open source companies often face RFI/RFQs written to best-fit
      specific proprietary products or written in a way which does not suit open source
      solutions and thus the integrator/channel partner needs to find a legal
      accommodation which doesnât actually reflect the well established legal constructs
      underpinning open source.

                                                                                                               6
                                                                               Ref. Ares(2026)1148378 - 03/02/2026

   â â Recent improvements, however, have been noticeable in certain markets when full and
       balanced discussion takes place - most recently, Germany has reviewed its public
       procurement terms and conditions (âEVB-ITâ) to reflect open source clauses and to
       make it easier for public contracting authorities to procure open source software. The
       new templates will be published shortly;
   â â Procurement needs to not only recognise but prioritise solutions that give back to
       society. As such, it is not just about buying more open source but prioritising those
       companies that contribute the most to its maintenance, functionality and resiliency.
       An upstream-first model thus needs to be encouraged / prioritised as it forms the
       backbone to cutting edge open innovation and giving back to what is, largely, a public
       good accessible to all.
   â â The continued lack of established and well resourced (and politically supported) Open
       Source Program Offices (OSPOs) within public institutions continues to hold back civil
       servants from moving from passive consumers to active contributors. This can be
       fast-tracked with a combination of political re-prioritisation and understanding as well
       as investment in skills and best-practice guidance where Red Hat would be ready to
       help with (as we have been doing for decades across sectors and around the world).
       An open innovation lab - including political leadership - would demonstrate the
       extraordinary innovation and scaling potential of this technology whilst being in full
       control of your infrastructure and data.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please provide
concrete examples.

The added value of open source is not merely cost reduction, but resilience, stability,
innovation, reversibility and digital sovereignty â the ability to control and audit
infrastructure.

As explicitly requested by the European Commission, herewith just some open source
examples in both the European public and private sectors which provide concrete examples of
the added value of open source to European modernisation and thus providing enterprise
grade solutions and services to citizens and customers alike. We would be delighted to share
other sectoral examples - upon request and subject to customer approval.

Public Sector: Across Europe, public administrations are utilising enterprise open source
platforms to drive high-impact citizen services with operational autonomy:

    ââ City of Vienna and Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha (JCCM) have
        deployed AI and automated workflows to accelerate services ranging from virtual
        assistants to environmental assessments;

                                                                                                               7
                                                                             Ref. Ares(2026)1148378 - 03/02/2026

    ââ the Basque Government's EJIE, and Irelandâs Department of Agriculture, Food and
        the Marine (DAFM) leverage containerised architectures and open standards to
        power e-government portals, language translation services, and grant processing;
    ââ large-scale entities like La Poste have utilised enterprise open source platforms to
        deliver essential services whilst ITZBund (the central IT provider for the German
        federal government) created an IT architecture that meets both the security and data
        protection requirements for government agencies and the requirements of a modern
        development platform.

Private sector: European leaders utilise enterprise open source to maintain strategic control
over their infrastructure and decouple from proprietary roadmaps.

    ââ Major European entities use enterprise open source to secure their long-term
        operational independence. Industrial leaders like Siemens utilise modular
        microservices to optimise complex production systems, while financial institutions
        such as BBVA, CrÃ©dit Agricole, and Mutua MadrileÃ±a have built automated,
        cloud-native platforms to manage massive infrastructure environments. By
        standardising on these open technologies, these organisations maintain the ability to
        audit, scale, and evolve their core systems without being tethered to the strategic
        shifts of a single proprietary provider;
    ââ Similarly, other major European companies like Amadeus, Airbus, and Volkswagen
        leverage these platforms to build standardised environments that drive operational
        autonomy across their cloud environments. Porsche Informatik and Bosch use open
        technologies to manage complex data centers and production lines - driving
        innovation while protecting their long-term infrastructure autonomy;
    ââ Also, in the telecommunications and defence sectors, organisations like TelefÃ³nica
        Spain, Orange, Deutsche Telekom and Navantia use enterprise open source
        technologies for a wide range of purposes such as enabling the interoperability
        required for 5G/6G and edge computing. This strategic shift allows them to utilise a
        multivendor environment for greater flexibility and long-term sovereignty over their
        infrastructure. Project Sylva, is an open source framework initiated by Europeâs "Big
        Five" (Orange, Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, TelefÃ³nica, and Telecom Italia) along
        with European network providers Ericsson and Nokia. Project Sylva underscores a
        deep commitment to open source collaboration, leveraging a community-driven
        model to solve the telecommunications industry's challenge of fragmented legacy
        infrastructure;
    ââ Finally, another European sector which also uses and contributes a lot to open source
        is financial services, leaders such as Kruk, B2 Impact, and Matmut have established
        standardised, open environments that drive their digital autonomy.

                                                                                                             8
                                                                              Ref. Ares(2026)1148378 - 03/02/2026

Finally, the value-add brought to digital sovereignty by open source also relies on a vibrant
ecosystem of partners capable of meeting specific in-country requirements. Red Hat enjoys
strong collaboration with a network of European partners - such as IONOS, SysEleven, Cloud
Temple, and Numspot - to offer tailored sovereign capabilities and services. These
partnerships facilitate that public and private organisations can scale services while
maintaining authority over their data and technical roadmaps. Red Hatâs collaborative, open
approach allows European entities to innovate within a multi-cloud environment without the
external interference or constraints of proprietary vendor lock-in.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the development
and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs technological
sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

Market-led innovation, supported by procurement and possibly fiscal reform, could be a more
sustainable and effective engine for growth than grants/funds. That said, funding can
complement market led innovation where it is shown that thereâs otherwise a risk of âtragedy
of the commonsâ and thus our support for a focused EU sovereign tech fund.

Although not an EU competence, the question of tax-incentives for those upstream-first
models as well as other models which encourage contribution might be worthwhile exploring
at a Member State level as a more effective way to accelerate more use and contribution in
Europe to the global open source community and open innovation movement. The
Communication might suggest examining, for example, whether European tax and accounting
systems typically incentivise proprietary research (i.e. offering credits and subsidies for
creating âassetsâ) over and above open source contributions (i.e. such as bug fixes, security
patches, and maintenance) which might, from an accounting perspective, be merely viewed as
âcostsâ?

The EU should leverage the New Legislative Framework (NLF) and Regulation 1025/2012 to
harmonise standards that favour "high-hygiene" open standards. Harmonization is currently
hampered because the structures for IT standardisation in Europe regularly result in
competing efforts. To remedy this, the EU needs to establish a distinct place and process for
open digital standards development that enables straightforward implementation in open
source.

European procurement must move beyond the "lowest cost" paradigm to the Best
Price-Quality Ratio (BPQR), where "quality" explicitly includes criteria such as upstream
contribution, open standards compliance, and vendor neutrality.

                                                                                                              9
                                                                               Ref. Ares(2026)1148378 - 03/02/2026

As mentioned above there is perhaps a need to re-focus any potential mandate from "Made
in" to, say, âContribution byâ in the case of open source. As already explained, geographic
restrictions (e.g., excluding non-EU contributors) would be antithetical to open source
licensing and would force European firms to forfeit access to global innovation.

Cybersecurity Act (CSA) review presents an opportunity to align the implementation of the
Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) with open source realities by recognising that security is a
process of collective auditability, not a static certificate of origin. Moreover, ensuring Mutual
Recognition of certification both across the EU as well as with other 3rd country nations
would be a huge benefit to those companies offering open source solutions and thus ensure
they can certify once and then focus - often scarce resources - on more engineering related
to bolstering resilience.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

Priority must be placed on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure,
specifically focusing on the "democratisation of inference":

   ââ AI: Over the past 12 months, Red Hat (and other open source companies) have shown
       the opportunities in open source AI by demonstrating an opportunity to repeat the
       success and benefit to humanity brought about by the Linux operating system. By
       contributing to vLLM and llm-d, Red Hat enables European organisations to run
       self-hosted models on any hardware. While vLLM provides the raw speed for
       inference, llm-d provides the orchestration layer required to run these models at scale
       on-premise. Through techniques like disaggregated serving and intelligent routing,
       llm-d significantly lowers the cost and energy barriers for European entities, making
       high-performance Agentic AI economically viable without relying on proprietary
       hyper-scaler clouds
   ââ Small Language Models (sLLMs): Prioritise sLLMs that can run on-premise. This
       allows European entities to utilise AI without sending sensitive citizen data to
       third-party proprietary clouds thereby addressing todayâs geopolitical concerns whilst
       reflecting the requirements of key values and objectives as enshrined within EU
       regulations such as the GDPR, CRA and the AI Act.
   ââ Automation: The most significant technical prerequisites related to harvesting the
       benefits from AI, is related to organizations ability to automate and standardize their
       IT landscapes. Organisations' ability to implement Hybrid Cloud infrastructure are also
       tied to automation. One of the most popular automation frameworks, Ansible, is open

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased competitiveness
and cyber resilience?

Increased use of open source will drive competitiveness and resilience in all sectors - even
those which currently excel with both their use and contribution to open source. Herewith
some core pillars which should be considered as important drivers for both competitiveness
and resilience:

   ââ Sovereignty: open source offers a flexible, open hybrid cloud framework that enables
       European customers to deploy and manage sensitive workloads across a uniform
       infrastructure, from local data centers to regional partner clouds. The access to a
       portfolio of software and services tailored to ensure customers and partners can
       control who manages systems, where control planes operate, and where logs and
       telemetry data are stored. These offerings should also be supported by a dedicated
       support team made up of verified EU residents working exclusively within the region,
       ensuring verifiable local control over critical IT functions. These solutions must be
       based on the principles of global open source as the best route to achieving
       technological independence and operational resilience needed in todayâs complex
       regulatory environment.
   ââ "Right to Exit": Competitiveness is lost when organisations cannot switch providers.
       Open source guarantees the "right to exit" which is further enhanced through open
       standards and the ability to enjoy both switching and portability. We have worked
       closely on the EUâs Data Act and continue to stress the need for careful assessment of
       the available open standards and specifications developed by international
       fora/consortia and identification in the EU standardisation process;
   ââ EU Procurement: updating EU procurement criteria (adopted in 2014) to reflect
       todayâs mission critical role of open source solutions as well as prioritising upstream
       open source contribution models which continually improve functionality and
       enhanced resilience of what is essentially a public good.

                                      *** SECTION IV ***

Thank you for organising this timely consultation and we look forward to further engagement
and dialogue - along with other upstream first companies and open source foundations - to
provide additional data or information on this critically important topic. We remain at your
disposal to provide further clarity on our initial feedback to your five questions. Finally,
further to our last meeting, we would be delighted to present in more detail as to âwhy
contracting for open source is differentâ for open source companies.
