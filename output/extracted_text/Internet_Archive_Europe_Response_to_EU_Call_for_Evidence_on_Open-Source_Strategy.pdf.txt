About Internet Archive Europe
The Internet Archive Europe is part of a network of non-profit digital libraries spanning the US,
Europe, and Canada, all dedicated to providing universal access to knowledge. Our work embodies
both open source and open access principles: we rely on open source software to build and
maintain our infrastructure, and we provide open access to the digital materials we
preserveâincluding websites, books, audio, video, images, and software.

Since 1996, the Internet Archive has been collecting and preserving the World Wide Web, providing
free public access through the Wayback Machine. This work depends entirely on open source tools
for web crawling, data processing, and access systems. Operating at web scaleâbillions of pages
collected over decadesâwe have developed deep expertise in building open infrastructure that
works effectively across the entire internet. We contribute to and maintain numerous open source
projects for digital preservation, ensuring these tools remain available to memory institutions
worldwide.

Our commitment to openness extends beyond software to the content we preserve. We provide
free, unrestricted access to our collections, enabling researchers, educators, journalists, and the
public to access historical versions of websites, out-of-print books, and other materials that might
otherwise be lost or inaccessible. National libraries and archives across Europe and beyond rely on
our open access collections and open source tools as critical infrastructure for their own
preservation missions. This combination of open source infrastructure and open access to
knowledge demonstrates that openness is not just technically superiorâit is essential for serving
the public interest.

                                                                                                       1
Introduction
We welcome the European Commission's call for evidence on strengthening the EU's open-source
sector. Internet Archive Europe strongly supports open source as a foundation for preserving and
providing universal access to knowledge. Our submission focuses on three interconnected areas
where open source principles directly enable our mission: web archiving and preservation,
development of AI models and tools, and ensuring public access to knowledge resources.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU
open-source sector?

Strengths

Open Infrastructure for Knowledge Preservation: Europe has been very active in the development
of strong open source tools and standards for digital preservation, including web archiving
software, such as Heritrix (web crawler), OpenWayback, and various WARC processing utilities,
metadata standards, and interoperability protocols

Collaborative Research Infrastructure: European research institutions have built robust open
source ecosystems for data science, machine learning, and digital humanities. This collaborative
approach enables smaller institutions and civil society organisations to access sophisticated tools
without prohibitive licensing costs.

Standards Development: The EU's emphasis on open standards has created strong foundations for
interoperability in digital preservation and access systems.

Weaknesses and Barriers

Sustainability of Niche Preservation Tools: Specialised tools for digital preservation, web archiving,
and cultural heritage often lack sustained funding and maintenance. These tools are critical
infrastructure for memory institutions but may not have obvious commercial applications.

Fragmented Approaches to AI Model Development: There is insufficient coordination between
efforts to build open AI models and the need for high-quality, openly accessible training data.
Large-scale web archives, digitised books, and cultural heritage collections could serve as valuable
training resources but are often underutilised due to legal uncertainty and technical barriers.

Access Restrictions: Overly restrictive interpretations of copyright and database rights sometimes
prevent the use of archived web content for training AI models, even when such use would advance
research and innovation without harming rights holders. This creates an imbalance where
commercial entities with legal departments can navigate these complexities more easily than
academic and civil society organisations.

                                                                                                    2
2. What is the added value of open source for public and
private sectors?

For Digital Preservation and Memory Institutions

Cost-Effective Scale: Web archiving at internet scale requires processing billions of web pages.
Open source tools enable organisations to build and maintain these capabilities at a fraction of the
cost of proprietary solutions. For example, the Wayback Machine and similar tools at national
libraries rely fundamentally on open source software stacks.

Long-Term Accessibility: Proprietary formats and closed systems risk creating "digital dark ages"
where content becomes inaccessible as vendors change or disappear. Open source ensures that
preserved digital content remains accessible across generations, as the tools needed to access it can
be maintained and updated indefinitely.

Transparency and Trust: Memory institutions serve as trusted custodians of cultural heritage. Open
source software allows these institutions to demonstrate exactly how they collect, process, and
provide access to materials and to establish standard protocols and methods while doing so. This
contributes to building public trust in these critical functions.

For AI Development and Research

Tensors as the New Code: The Case for Open Source AI

Tensors, the numerical weights of neural networks, have become the functional equivalent of
executable code, encoding capabilities learned from vast datasets rather than explicit programming
logic. Just as the open source movement recognized that software freedom requires access to
source code, meaningful openness in AI demands access to model weights, training code, and
datasets.

Model weights alone are insufficient: true reproducibility, auditing, and community-driven
improvement require the complete trilogy of open models, open training code, and open data.
Without open datasets, we cannot verify model capabilities, audit for biases, or enable researchers
and smaller organizations to train competitive models.

The concentration of computational resources and proprietary datasets in a few hands threatens to
create an AI oligopoly. To preserve the democratic innovation that made software flourish, we must
advocate for complete AI transparency, open weights, open code, and open data.

Training Data Transparency: Web archives, digitised books, and other cultural heritage materials
provide rich, diverse datasets that can improve model quality and reduce bias. When both the
models and the training data are open, researchers can understand, audit, and improve AI systems.

                                                                                                   3
Enabling Innovation: Smaller research institutions, startups, and civil society organisations can
participate in AI development when they have access to both open source tools and open training
datasets. This democratises innovation and ensures that AI development reflects diverse
perspectives rather than only the interests of large commercial entities.

For Universal Access to Knowledge

Removing Barriers: Open source software and open access to digital collections work together to
provide universal access to knowledge. When libraries, archives, and educational institutions use
open source systems, they can share tools, reduce costs, and extend access to underserved
communities.

Cross-Border Collaboration: Open source enables European institutions to collaborate across
national boundaries without vendor lock-in or compatibility issues. A French researcher can use
tools developed in Germany to access collections held in Poland, all built on shared open source
infrastructure.

3. What concrete measures may be taken at EU level?

Support Open Source Digital Preservation Infrastructure

   1. Establish sustained funding mechanisms for critical open source tools used in digital
      preservation and web archiving. These tools form essential infrastructure for memory
      institutions but often rely on volunteer maintainers or sporadic project funding.
   2. Create a European Digital Preservation Commons that brings together national libraries,
      archives, and research institutions to collaboratively develop and maintain open source
      preservation tools.

Enable Responsible Use of Archived Content for AI Training

   3. Clarify legal frameworks to explicitly permit the use of web archives and digitised cultural
      heritage collections for training AI models, provided such use respects the non-commercial
      nature of preservation and does not substitute for access to original works.
   4. Develop technical standards and tools for making web archives accessible to AI researchers
      while implementing appropriate safeguards (e.g., respecting robots.txt for historical
      snapshots, excluding sensitive content).
   5. Support the creation of high-quality, openly licensed training datasets derived from
      European cultural heritage collections. These datasets would give European AI developers
      access to diverse, multilingual content while demonstrating European leadership in
      responsible AI development.

Promote Open Access to Knowledge Infrastructure

                                                                                                4
   6. Mandate open source requirements in public funding for digital library and archive
      infrastructure. When public funds create digital collections and access systems, the tools
      should be openly available for reuse.
   7. Support interoperability standards that enable seamless access across European digital
      collections, building on existing initiatives like Europeana but ensuring the underlying
      infrastructure remains open and accessible.
   8. Recognise web archiving as critical infrastructure deserving of public support comparable to
      physical libraries and archives. The internet is now the primary medium for publishing and
      communication; preserving it openly should be treated as a public good.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised?
From Internet Archive Europe's perspective, the following areas deserve priority:

Web Archiving and Preservation Technologies: Tools for large-scale web crawling, WARC
processing, content extraction, format migration, and long-term digital preservation. These
technologies ensure that Europe's digital cultural heritage remains accessible.

Natural Language Processing and AI for Cultural Heritage: Open source NLP tools and models
trained on European languages and cultural materials. This includes OCR for historical documents,
entity recognition for archival materials, and translation tools that work well with historical and
regional language variants.

Access and Discovery Systems: Open source search, browsing, and recommendation systems
designed for digital collections. These systems should respect privacy, avoid manipulative design
patterns, and enable genuine discovery rather than merely optimising engagement.

Data Processing and Analysis Tools: Open source tools that enable researchers to analyse
large-scale web archives and digital collections, including computational social science, digital
humanities, and network analysis capabilities.

5. In what sectors could increased use of open source lead to
increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
Cultural Heritage and Memory Institutions: Open source provides the foundation for efficient,
sustainable, and trustworthy digital preservation. As more cultural content moves online, open
source tools enable institutions to adapt quickly without vendor dependencies.

Research and Education: Open source reduces barriers to entry for research, enables
reproducibility, and allows smaller institutions to participate in cutting-edge work. When combined
with open access to training data from archives and collections, this creates a powerful engine for
European innovation in AI and data science.

                                                                                                 5
AI Development: Europe can differentiate itself by building AI systems with transparent training
data and open source foundations. Web archives and cultural heritage collections provide unique
training resources that, when openly available, enable the development of models that reflect
European values and languages.

Public Infrastructure: Government websites, educational platforms, and public service systems built
on open source can more easily share improvements, respond to security issues collectively, and
avoid vendor lock-in. Using archived web content to train models that improve public services
creates additional value from preservation efforts.

Conclusion
Internet Archive Europe urges the European Commission to recognise that open source software
and open access to preserved digital content are mutually reinforcing elements of digital
infrastructure. Support for open source must extend beyond traditional software development to
include the specialised tools and systems that enable universal access to knowledge.

By clarifying legal frameworks for using archived web content in AI training, supporting the
maintenance of digital preservation tools, and promoting open access to European cultural heritage
as training data, the EU can advance multiple policy objectives simultaneously: strengthening open
source ecosystems, enabling responsible AI development, preserving cultural heritage, and ensuring
universal access to knowledge.

Open source is not only about technology: it is about ensuring that knowledge remains accessible,
that innovation remains possible, and that the public interest remains at the center of digital
infrastructure. Internet Archive Europe stands ready to contribute our expertise in web-scale
archiving and preservation to these important objectives.
