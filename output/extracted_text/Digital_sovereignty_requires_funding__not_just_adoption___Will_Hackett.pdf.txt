           Digital sovereignty requires funding, not
           just adoption
           The European Commission has launched a call for evidence on a new âEuropean
           Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy.â1 The consultation runs until February 3rd, and
           the framing is telling: open source as a âpublic good to be freely used, modified, and
           redistributedâ that could strengthen EU technological independence and
           cybersecurity.2

           Theyâve correctly identified the problem. European governments and businesses are
           deeply dependent on non-EU software vendorsâMicrosoft, Google, Amazonâ
           creating supply chain vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. The solution theyâre
           reaching for is open source. No vendor lock-in. Auditable code. The freedom to fork
           if a project dies or a company pivots against your interests.

           Iâve written separately about how the US CLOUD Act and deteriorating trust in
           transatlantic data handling are already pushing European governments to unwind
           Microsoft dependencies. Europeâs quiet revolt against US cloud makes the
           sovereignty risk concrete: a hostile US administration could compel providers to
           withhold or seize data, leaving Europe exposed unless it controls its own stack.

           Itâs the right instinct. But it wonât work unless theyâre willing to pay for it.

           Open source is genuinely the right tool
           Letâs be clear: the EU isnât wrong about the technology choice. Open source
           genuinely is the path to digital sovereignty, and the reasoning is straightforward.

           When your government runs on proprietary software, youâre renting your own
           infrastructure. Microsoft can change licensing terms. Oracle can audit you into
           submission. Amazon can deprecate the managed service youâve built your systems
           on. You have no recourse because you donât own the code.

           Open source changes the power dynamic. You can audit it for security
           vulnerabilities and backdoorsâcritical for government systems. You can fork it if the
           maintainers take the project in a direction that doesnât serve you. You can hire local
           developers to customise it for your specific needs. Youâre not locked into a single
           vendorâs roadmap.

           This isnât theoretical. Munich famously migrated to Linux, then back to Windows,
           then is reconsidering Linux again.3 The back-and-forth isnât a failure of open source
           âitâs a demonstration of optionality. They could switch. Try doing that with a decade
           of Microsoft 365 integrations.

           What Iâve seen in open source
           Iâve been writing code professionally for over fifteen years, and open source has
           been the foundation of everything Iâve built. The products Iâve work onâFlowstate,
           Jamie, MimeProtect, Blinqâare built on thousands of dependencies maintained by
           people Iâll never meet.

           Some of those maintainers are employed by large companies who contribute to
           open source as part of their business model. But many arenât. Theyâre individuals
           maintaining critical infrastructure in their spare time, often for little or no
           compensation.

           Iâve watched this pattern repeat: a brilliant developer creates a library that solves a
           hard problem. It gets adopted. Companies build products on it. The maintainerâs
           GitHub notifications become overwhelming. They burn out. The project either gets
           abandoned or limps along with sporadic updates.

           The worst part is when something breaks. A vulnerability gets disclosed. The
           maintainerâwhoâs been doing this for free, often while holding down a day jobâ
           suddenly has the entire internet demanding an urgent patch. Some handle it
           gracefully. Others disappear.

           This isnât sustainable. Weâve built the digital economy on volunteer labour, and we
           keep acting surprised when volunteers run out of energy.

           The value extraction problem
           What the EU consultation is acknowledging is that much of the value generated by
           European open source projects is captured by large international tech companies
           rather than benefiting the EU economy.4

           European developers build tools. They publish them as open source. Amazon takes
           those tools, wraps them in managed services, and sells them back to European
           companies. Elastic, Redis, MongoDBâthe pattern is well-documented. The creators
           build; the hyperscalers monetise.

           This is the sovereignty leak the EU is trying to plug. But you canât solve it just by
           using more open source. If European governments adopt open source but the
           developers behind those projects still canât pay rent, youâve just shifted your
           dependency from Microsoft to unpaid volunteers.

           The value needs to stay in the ecosystem. That means paying the people who build
           and maintain the software.

           Grants are not the answer
           The EU knows how to fund things. Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, national
           innovation programmesâthereâs no shortage of grant mechanisms. But grants solve
           the wrong problem.

           Grants are goal-oriented. You apply for funding to build something new. You hit
           milestones. You deliver a final report. The project ends.

           Open source infrastructure doesnât work that way. The OpenSSL library that secures
           most of the internet wasnât under-resourced because nobody funded a new TLS
           implementation. It was under-resourced because nobody funded the ongoing
           maintenance of an existing one. When Heartbleed hit in 2014, the world discovered
           that critical encryption infrastructure was maintained by a handful of developers
           working part-time.5

           Log4j was the same story. A logging library used by virtually every Java application
           on the planet, maintained by volunteers. When the Log4Shell vulnerability emerged,
           those volunteers had to scramble to fix a critical flaw affecting billions of systemsâ
           without being paid for it.6

           You cannot grant your way to infrastructure. Grants fund projects; infrastructure
           needs operations. The distinction matters.

           What real funding looks like
           The EU consultation mentions âsustainable developer compensation modelsâ and
           industry stakeholders have submitted a 70-point roadmap covering investment
           mechanisms.7 These are the right conversations to be having.

           Real funding for open source looks like:

           Operational budgets, not project grants. Pay maintainers a salary to keep critical
           infrastructure secure and updated. Fund the boring work: security patches,
           dependency updates, documentation, community management.

           Public procurement preferences. If European governments are spending billions on
           software, require that spending to preference open source solutions with European
           maintainers. Every euro spent on Microsoft licences is a euro not spent building
           sovereign alternatives.

           Infrastructure support. Build and host services that open source projects need:
           CI/CD, package repositories, documentation hosting. The Linux Foundation and
           Apache Foundation provide some of this, but thereâs room for European equivalents.

           Technical writing and accessibility. Good documentation makes projects usable.
           Fund technical writers to make open source tools accessible to government IT
           teams who might not have the expertise to work from source code alone.

           The consultation feedback shows the community understands this.8 The question is
           whether the EU will commit the budget.

           Sovereignty is a spending decision
https://www.willhackett.uk/eu-open-source-sovereignty                                                                            4/6

           The EU spends enormous sums on software. Government departments across
           Europe pay Microsoft, Google, and Amazon licensing fees that collectively run into
           billions annually. Some of that spending is inevitableâyouâre not going to replace
           Windows overnight.

           But every procurement decision is a choice. Every renewal of an enterprise
           agreement is money that could fund sovereign alternatives.

           Digital sovereignty isnât a technology choice. Itâs a budget line item.

           The EU has correctly identified that open source is the tool. But a tool sitting in a
           shed doesnât build anything. You need people to use it, maintain it, and improve it.
           Those people need to pay rent.

           Open source wonât save Europe from technological dependency unless Europe pays
           for it. Not with grants for flashy new projects, but with operational funding for the
           infrastructure we already depend on. Not with innovation programmes, but with
           procurement policies that direct money toward European maintainers.

           The consultation closes February 3rd. The question isnât whether the EU
           understands the problemâthey clearly do. The question is whether theyâll write the
           cheques.
