Committed to Europe
Orangeâs contribution to the European Commissionâs Call for Evidence on
the Open Digital Ecosystem

Orange welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the European Commission forthcoming Strategy
on Open Digital Ecosystem.

Orange is heavily relying on open source to operate its telecommunication services, such as telco
cloud infrastructure (Sylva, in the Linux Foundation Europe), customer equipment operating system
(PRPL Foundation), or telecom routing equipment software (SONiC, Linux Foundation). It also uses
horizontal IT open-source solutions.

We share below some inputs to the questions of the EC Call for evidence.

The software sector within the European Union exhibits significant strengths, notably a growing
community of developers (users or contributors to open-source) and a rich ecosystem of public,
academic, and industrial actors. Moreover 42% of EU organizations now contribute directly to the
open-source projects on which they have dependencies. This is overall a trend that we observe and
share within the Linux Foundation Research report 1on the state of Open source in Europe for the
last 5 year.

In addition, Open source shows a natural alignment with the EU's strategic values such as
transparency, openness, interoperability, security, and the protection of fundamental rights. Open
source is also a strategic lever for digital sovereignty: it promotes technological autonomy, reduces
dependency on non-European actors, and facilitates the auditability of code, which is a key element
for trust and security. Notably, recent research from Canonical2 highlighted that for 89% of
European companies included in their panel, open-source is the most important approach for
trusted and sovereign AI.

The open-source ecosystem is structured around 3 major global foundations (Linux foundation,
Eclipse foundation and Apache software foundation) with worldwide projects. Beside these major
foundations we see smaller and more dedicated ones addressing specific technological or business
purposes. For instance, in Europe: OW2 (Paris), The Document Foundation (Germany), the NLNET
Foundation (The Netherlands), and VideoLAN (France). In addition, institutional projects such as
DIGITAL Commons EDIC designed to provide long term stability and coordination among EU
member states, the Sovereign Tech Agency in Germany, the European Open Source Academy
(EOSA), and the European Commissionâs OSOR (Open Source Observatory) platform demonstrate
increasing support.

I.       The added value of open-source

     The added value of open-source is considerable, as it supports:

     1. Strategic independence and sovereignty, it:
     âª Enhances digital sovereignty and resilience by reducing dependency on non-EU technology
        providers and enabling operations on European-controlled infrastructure with real architectural
        and implementations optionality;
     âª Promotes vendor independence, significantly reducing the risk of "lock-in" and ensuring long-
        term control over technology choices;
     âª Provides strategic flexibility to adapt technology stacks without being constrained by proprietary
        roadmaps or close-source lifecycles.

     2. Security, trust and transparency, it:
     âª Improves security and transparency through code openness, allowing enhanced auditability,
        facilitating the detection of vulnerabilities, and enabling verification of the absence of hidden
        functionalities (backdoors, malware, or surveillance features);
     âª Enables community-driven security improvements through peer review and collective scrutiny,
        often resulting in faster vulnerability detection and patching.

     3. Innovation and technical agility, open-source:
     âª Accelerates innovation and time-to-market by providing access to pre-built components,
        libraries, and frameworks, enabling rapid prototyping and iteration;
     âª Fosters interoperability through open standards, enabling seamless integration with other tools
        and platforms while supporting scalable, modular, and future-proof architectures;
     âª Encourages experimentation and customization without permission barriers or additional
        licensing costs;
     âª Provides resilience, flexibility and competitiveness as provider swapping is easier, when
        necessary;
     âª Shared components often lower Total Cost of Ownership, accelerate time to market and is a
        key lever to reduce carbon footprint and attain RSE objectives, in particular regarding hardware
        lifespan.

     4. Talent & organizational development, it:
     âª Develops internal skills and expertise as teams gain deep understanding of the technology stack
        through direct code access;
     âª Attracts and retains top talent who value working with modern, transparent technologies and
        contributing to broader ecosystems;
     âª Builds institutional knowledge that remains within the organization rather than being locked in
        vendor-specific expertise.

     5. Compliance and governance, open-source:
     âª Supports regulatory compliance by facilitating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation,
        supply chain transparency, and audit readiness aligned with requirements such as the Cyber
        Resilience Act (CRA) and NIS2 Directive;
     âª Enables organizations to demonstrate due diligence in software supply chain management and
        meet emerging regulatory obligations around software transparency.

     To be fully materialised, this open-source added value requires sustained investments/fundings in
     skills, governance, and contributions to open-source communities, in order to ensure the quality,

     February 2026                                                                                  2
  security, and sustainability of European open-source solutions.

  In the telecommunications sector, concrete examples of key network functions include:
  âª VoIP;
  âª Switching/routing (network operating system);
  âª Security firewalls;
  âª Network services lifecycle management, and
  âª Telco cloud infrastructure (Sylva).

  Telecom operators play a crucial role as integrators, adapting and contributing to these software
  components to build reliable and high-performance/carrier-grade services.

II.      Weaknesses and structural barriers

  Despite its strategic potential for European competitiveness and digital sovereignty, the open-
  source sector faces significant weaknesses and structural barriers that require urgent attention.
  They are the following:

  1. Strategic maturity gap
  âª Key impact: Low level of commitment on open source leading to economic value captured
      abroad.
  âª Key points to consider:
      o Low organizational adoption and governance: According to Linux Foundation Europe3, only
          34% of European organizations maintain a formal open-source strategy, and just 22% have
          established an Open Source Program Office (OSPO). This governance gap limits
          organizations' ability to capture the full strategic value of open source, failing to address the
          critical need for long-term maintenance.
      o Insufficient contribution culture: While progress has been made (42% of organizations now
          actively contribute to projects they depend on), 30% still consume without contributing
          back, undermining long-term ecosystem sustainability.
      o Value captured outside of Europe: Although the EU hosts one of the world's largest open-
          source developer communities, much of the economic value generated flows abroad. 65%
          of VC-backed investment in open-source-based companies occurs in the US, where the
          commercial open-source model is better understood and yields superior exit valuations
          (approximately 7x at IPO, 14x in M&A).

  2. Ecosystem fragmentation and scale
  âª Key impact: An insufficiently developed ecosystem in the EU unable to compete with Global
      digital players, where strategic decisions are potentially not aligned with EU interests.
  âª Key points to consider:
      o Lack of European scale: The European open-source ecosystem relies heavily on smaller
          entities that struggle to scale up, limiting their capacity to deliver enterprise-grade support
          and services. This creates perception issues around robustness and maturity compared to
          offerings from large non-EU players;
      o Lack of presence of European players on global foundations and communitiesâ governance:
          Many critical open-source projects, even those with significant European contributions, are
          governed by foundations or communities where European players are not enough acting
          and governing, leading to potential non-alignment in terms of strategic decisions with
          European interests;

    o    Dependency on critical non-EU infrastructure: Critical tooling (GitHub, NPM (Node Packet
         Manager), cloud platforms) is predominantly US-based, raising digital sovereignty and
         supply chain concerns;
    o    Absence of unified coordination: Europe lacks a unified mechanism to fund, coordinate, and
         sustain critical open-source infrastructure at continental scale, including VC landscape to
         enable the proper bootstrap of companies setting open source at the core of their strategies
         from seed to round A (Example: Commit from Red River West);
    o    Lack of catalogue and visibility for open-source components/open-source publishers.

3. Funding and sustainability challenges
âª Key impact: Critical projects risk being unsustainable, and promising solutions fail to reach
    market.
âª Key points to consider:
    o Fragmented and short-term funding: Current EU funding models typically support projects
       for limited periods before discontinuing support â failing to address the critical need for
       long-term evolution including development, maintenance. testing, certification, operational
       support, and corrective/evolutive maintenance. This gap prevents promising projects from
       reaching production readiness.

4. Open-source skills and talent shortage
âª Key impact: Increased dependency on non-EU expertise and delayed digital transformation.
âª Key points to consider:
    o Critical skills gap: Europe faces a shortage of qualified professionals in key areas: open-
      source security, long-term maintenance, project governance, and Open-source Project
      Office (OSPO) management;
    o Maintainers not recognized as critical infrastructure: Despite open-source components
      representing 70-90% of modern software systems, maintainers of foundational projects lack
      formal recognition, institutional support, and sustainable income. Europe has not yet treated
      maintainers as essential personnel for critical digital infrastructure;
    o Cultural resistance to openness: Many organizations struggle with the cultural shift toward
      transparency, collaboration, and community engagement that open source requires.
      Moreover, software is often not viewed as a core competency, leading to underinvestment
      in open-source tools and talent.

5. Perception, awareness, and risk barriers
âª Key impact: Compliance risk, slower adoption in mission-critical environments.
âª Key points to consider:
    o Persistent negative risk perceptions: Open source continues to be associated with concerns
       around maintenance burden, security risks, and supply chain vulnerabilities, despite growing
       evidence that code transparency and community scrutiny often improve security outcomes;
    o Low regulatory awareness: for instance, 62% of organizations globally report low familiarity
       with the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA); among those unfamiliar, nearly one-third are based in
       Europe. This awareness gap threatens compliance readiness and misses the opportunity to
       leverage CRA as a catalyst for open source;
    o Robustness and maturity concerns: Perceptions persist that open-source solutions lack the
       enterprise-grade reliability and support of proprietary alternatives, creating hesitation for
       deployment in mission-critical environments, even when evidence suggests otherwise;
    o Lack of awareness of legal implications of open-source licences;
    o Lack of awareness of the existing European open-source industrial ecosystem.

February 2026                                                                                   4
       6. Structural and institutional gaps
       âª Key impact: reduced trust, slower market adoption, barriers to contribution.
       âª Key points to consider:
           o No independent European certification framework: Europe lacks a recognized, independent
               structure for cybersecurity and compliance certification of open-source solutions, creating
               uncertainty for public and private adopters;
           o No production validation infrastructure: Absence of independent facilities for MVP testing,
               field trials, and productization support to help open-source solutions demonstrate readiness
               for operational deployment;
           o Legal complexity: Navigating open-source licenses remains challenging for organizations,
               particularly regarding license compatibility, potential "contamination" of proprietary code,
               and intellectual property protection. This complexity creates barriers to both adoption and
               contribution;
           o TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) misconceptions: While open source can reduce total cost of
               ownership in many cases, this is not systematic. Complex projects requiring significant
               support and maintenance may not deliver expected cost savings â which should be better
               acknowledged by decision-makers.

III.           EU initiatives to support open-source

       To overcome these barriers, several initiatives at the EU level could be foreseen:

       1. Policy & regulatory framework
       âª Clarify roles and responsibilities between developers, publishers and distributors of solutions
          including open-source to remain compliant with CRA and NIS2 without impacting the
          development of the European open-source ecosystem;
       âª Encourage open-source interoperability and open standards mandates by requiring open
          formats and APIs in public procurement to create a more level playing field for open-source
          solutions;
       âª Develop harmonized policies across member states to ensure consistent treatment of open
          source in public sector digital transformation. For instance, install processes where public
          sectors RFP should consider open-source based solutions;
       âª Create legal frameworks that recognize open-source contributions as valid proof of innovation
          for R&D tax incentives and public funding eligibility.

       2. Financial support
       âª Establish long-term, predictable EU funding mechanisms rather than project-based grants to
          ensure sustainability (projects development, integration, maintenance, evolution);
       âª Support the creation or enhancement of existing independent European structures for testing
          and certification;
       âª Improve the distribution and awareness of open-source available solutions at EU level; the work
          done for example with the Next Generation Internet Initiative should be continued and further
          developed;
       âª Create co-funding schemes that enable member states and EC to jointly invest in shared open-
          source infrastructure;
       âª Ease and financially support / cofinance development of open-source software through
          associations like TOSIT4 in France;
       âª Establish funding mechanism to develop end-to-end security plan of critical open-source
          development (e.g. Security Project for QGIS â Oslandia).

3. Ecosystem development
âª Publish a reference open-source manifesto to promote open-source mindset, including a
   sovereignty aspect that can serve as a relevant model, and establish a European website where
   organisation can declare their own manifesto;
âª Structure a European open-source industrial ecosystem: the EU must promote the emergence
   of a genuine industrial ecosystem around open source, for instance act to reinforce open-source
   VC within Europe;
âª Establish a specific status/label for SMEs specializing in open source to foster their
   development (e.g.: permanent start up status, tax-exempt contribution times to open source,
   simplification of the certification process to become an organization authorized to provide
   training for open source);
âª Set up a catalogue of Open Source Solutions (OSS) including the name of the organisations
   that are expert on these OSS;
âª Recognize and encourage âlarge software users associationsâ like TOSIT in France, the creation
   of a federation at European level (like CNLL5 and APELL6 for makers of open source) and
   foundations (OW2, Software Heritage, Linux Foundation Europe, Eclipse, Apache, etcâ¦);
âª Clarify and explain the open-source licensing system (e.g., copyleft) to reduce adoption
   barriers and provide legal certainty for organizations;
âª Actively support European representation and governance participation in global open-source
   foundations and communities to ensure strategic decisions align with EU interests;
âª Create pathways to help European open-source entities scale up to deliver enterprise-grade
   support and services that can compete with non-EU players;
âª Recognize maintainers as critical resources and establish support mechanisms and sustainable
   income pathways for maintainers of foundational open-source projects;
âª Reduce dependency on critical non-EU infrastructure by investing in European alternatives and
   mirror/redundancy capabilities to strengthen digital sovereignty. In particular, invest in public
   shared secured repositories for binary artefacts (Docker images, Java, Node, Python, etc.);
âª Establish programs to support OSPO (Open Source Program Office) adoption within EU
   enterprises;
âª Foster collaboration between public institutions, private companies, research organizations,
   and open-source communities;
âª Facilitate the organization of MVP/Field trials to accelerate development maturity and develop
   trust.

4. Procurement
âª Explore open-source as a first option in the public sector at all levels (from local authorities to
   EU) leveraging standardized procurement frameworks and evaluation criteria specifically
   adapted to open-source-based and sovereign solutions;
âª Develop standardized procurement frameworks and evaluation criteria specifically adapted to
   open-source-based solutions;
âª Simplify procurement (e.g. central procurement vehicles) for commonly used open-source
   solutions across member states;
âª Provide guidance on how to procure open-source services (support, customization, integration)
   rather than just licenses;
âª Encourage initiatives such as âFrance NumÃ©rique Libreâ in France.

5. Skills and Training
âª Launch large-scale training programs to develop expertise and best practices across Europe;

February 2026                                                                                   6
  âª      Support change management and cultural transformation programs to help organizations shift
         toward transparency, collaboration, and community engagement;
  âª      Encourage recognition of software development as a core organizational competency, not just
         an IT function, to drive proper investment in open-source talent and tools.

  6. Security and trust
  âª Strengthen cybersecurity and trust in open-source solutions through the development of
     European security frameworks for open-source software, including audits (like the EU FOSSA
     initiative), best practices for secure development, vulnerability management, and the promotion
     of common standards (e.g., SBOM, dependency traceability) aligned with European
     cybersecurity policies;
  âª Establish bug bounty programs and coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes for critical
     European open-source projects;
  âª Create trusted repositories and distribution channels with verified provenance and integrity
     checks;
  âª Develop guidelines for security assessment of open-source dependencies in line with CRA and
     NIS2 requirements;
  âª Build European capacity for security auditing and penetration testing of open-source software
     and vulnerability management (equivalent to MITRE7 in the USA).

IV.      Areas to prioritize

  The technological areas to prioritize are those underpinning critical telecom infrastructure and
  strategic autonomy:
  âª Cloud and edge infrastructure;
  âª Operating systems, infrastructure virtualization;
  âª 5G/6G and network function virtualization (including network operating systems like SONiC),
  âª Databases and data management platforms;
  âª AI ecosystem globally, including AI/ML frameworks and inferences;
  âª Cybersecurity tooling;
  âª Open hardware.

  As a conclusion, the telecommunications sector, by nature, is where increased open-source usage
  can generate significant gains in competitiveness and cyber resilience. Mastering these software
  components presents a unique opportunity for Europe to ensure sovereign control over essential
  infrastructures and IT vital to its economy and digital society.

  At Orange we believe that the EU and Member States authorities should better acknowledge the
  added value of open source: contribution to open-source communities must be recognized as a
  strategic matter for security, resilience, and digital sovereignty for Europe.
