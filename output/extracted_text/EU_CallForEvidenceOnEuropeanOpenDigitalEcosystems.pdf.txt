1 Introduction
After I was informed that the European Commission had published a Call for Evidence (CvE) on the upcoming
European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy I decided to submit my feedback on this topic. The reason is that I
see the importance of digital sovereignty for Europe but also for European citizens. I believe the current state
of affairs is not satisfactory because of many reasons that I will explain further. Because of my IT background,
work experience spanning many decades and personal interest and experience in using and managing both
proprietary and open source software I consider myself sufficiently qualified to submit meaningful feedback.

3 Current situation
3.1 Business to business (supplier) perspective

3.1.1 Market opportunity

If a company wants to become active in a certain digital market segment (e.g. financial software) it will face
the following challenges:
     ï· Building up knowledge about the requirements of the market
     ï· Training staff
     ï· Investment in developing software
     ï· Investment in hardware (for running server side software)
     ï· Investment in marketing
The above is especially problematic in deeply established markets that are dominated by just a few players.
Especially when it comes to enterprise grade solutions it is very difficult to gain momentum in the market
because of the challenges stated.

3.1.2 Access to required technologies

As mentioned in the previous sub-paragraph one of the challenges concerns investment in developing
software. Most suppliers will produce closed source software in order to be able to protect this distinguishing
element from implementation by competitors. This also has the (for them) welcoming effect of making it
harder for potential competitors to gain a stronghold in the market. This means that (potential) competitors
face large obstacles when it comes to developing/implementing the technology stack they need.

3.2 Business to business (customer) perspective

3.2.1 Choice
The amount of choice will of course depend of the type of digital solution that is required but in the current
market we see that choice with regard to the following types of solutions for employees is extremely limited:
     ï· Digital workplaces (computers + operating system) for employees
     ï· Office automation
     ï· Collaboration
The reason is that we depend primarily (more or less exclusively) on US companies for these solutions. The
reasons for this have to do with market dynamics and politics but I suffice to say that US companies have
managed to gain a stronghold in this regard in the last couple of decades. The opinion of the author is that this
is due to insufficient regulation and oversight on the one hand and customers simply looking at the most
effective solutions at the lowest cost.

3.2.2 Cost
As stated in the previous chapter US companies have gained a stronghold by offering compelling solutions for
affordable/low prices. However now that they have gained a market dominance that for many segments has
to characterised as semi-monopolies we see that they are slowly increasing their prices. This takes away to
some degree the initial benefit organisations had when opting for these solutions.

                                                          6/22
3.2.3 Control of data, privacy and security
When organisations choose their solutions they depend on the supplier to adhere to regulations related to
privacy and data security. The companies behind the digital solutions they have opted for will of course declare
formally that they are and will remain in line with these regulations. So legally one could say that this is
covered. However practically this is far from the case since US companies are also legally obligated to adhere
to US regulations. This means that unwanted exchange of data from European organisations with the US
government cannot be ruled out in spite of legal assurances that have been given. This can have unwanted
consequences for European security if this exchange is not in the interest of the old continent. For companies
it can have unwanted consequences in the space of competitiveness within the market if the US government
were to exchange obtained sensitive data with commercial entities in the US. Which is something that can on a
practical level not be ruled out, especially not with the current administration. Another security related risk
within the current market situation concerns the possibility of disabling technologies in use with European
organisations because of a reasons of national security of adversaries of the EU.

3.2.4 Ease of use
The mentioned market dominance of US companies in certain areas of the digital market and the semi-
monopolies positions hey acquired can or could have negative consequences for ease of use. The reason is
that ease of use cost money. Suppliers will have to conduct research on good user interfaces and good
functionalities. This cost will be spend if the market demands it, however if the position of clients is such that
there is not a lot to demand these companies will be inclined to spend less on innovation. They might even
deprecate functionalities that are not used enough (whereby the metric for âenoughâ of course is set by these
companies themselves). This is not in the interest of the clients of these solutions. The result being that they
will no longer reap the initial benefits of ease of use and their operations will suffer from this.

3.2.5 Ease of implementation
Ease of implementation is often not a problem since suppliers will make sure its as easy as possible to
implement their digital solutions because it is clearly in their benefit. They know that once an organisation has
opted for their offerings it will be relatively ease to ensure that they stay client. So the first step to make
organisation opt for a certain supplier is to make the process of implementation as easy as possible. This is
often the case when integrations between other systems are not necessary. This is the reason why more and
more companies (esp. US companies) offer suites consisting of many applications instead of singular solutions.
So for clients it seems beneficial to choose for these suites due to the relative ease of implementation.
However the downside of course is that they will have to make do with the solutions in the suite regardless of
the quality they have for the client. So the choice for ease of implementation will quite often also result in a
choice for less quality per individual application.

3.2.6 Ease of switching
Once organisations have chosen for a supplier this supplier will make sure that switching to another company
will be relatively difficult simply because it is in their interest to do this. There are multiple ways in which they
can do this, for instance:
     ï· Not offering export functionality
     ï· Not offering efficient export functionality (structure of information is not or badly suitable for
          importing in another solution)
     ï· Offering export functionality at high extra cost
However often this is not even necessary since switching to other solutions can be a daunting task because of
the following reasons:
     ï· Cost of training and implementation of new solutions

    ï·      Technical complexities of implementation of new solutions
    ï·      Risks regarding negative Impact on the business operations
3.3 Business to consumer (supplier) perspective

3.3.1 Market opportunity

The situation her is akin to that of the business to business situation. However since consumers are more and
more accustomed to vertically integrated systems (e.g. smartphones + operating system + services) and
because the suppliers of those systems control the whole technology stack the supplier who wants to offer its
services to consumers (especially on mobile platforms) only has two options: 1) To go along with whatever the
integrated system owner demands before services can be offered on âtheirâ platforms, 2) develop a new
integrated platform. The latter however is not a realistic choice since this does not only require developing the
operating system and the applications (related to the services to be offered) but also to entice makers of other
applications to port theirs to the new platform. And then last but certainly not least to entice consumers to
buy into that platform.

3.3.2 Access to required technologies

See the business to business supplier perspective.

3.4 Business to consumer (customer) perspective

3.4.1 Choice

Contrary to large organisations consumers do effectively not have a position of negotiation when it comes to
digital solutions they depend upon. Apart from that they in general do not have the interest in conducting
thorough marked research in order to see what works for them, what the implications of choosing that
solution are, etc. They will often choose that what seems to be easy to adapt to, what costs as little as possible
and what does not require a learning curve as low as possible. This is of course if there is a lot of choice to
begin with, which is often the problem right now. The most important digital solutions that consumers use at
the moment are:
     ï· Personal computers
     ï· Smartphones
     ï· Tablets
     ï· Communication platforms
     ï· Social media platforms
If we look at the above and look what is on offer than there is only a few US companies, Chinese companies
and a single Korean company that are playing a role in this space in the European union. They offer not only
devices (laptops, smartphones, etc.) but these devices come with a suite of applications that are integrated
with the operating system which the user cannot choose either. Sometimes its even difficult to uninstall
individual applications and use other options. The reason is that it is relatively easy for manufacturers to
frustrate the use of solutions not under their control. For instance by means of not facilitating good integration
of these alternative solutions with the operating system on the devices that they control. Once a consumer has
opted for a certain manufacturer for a certain type of device it is highly likely they are sticking to it because
they get accustomed to the workings of it. So after the initial choice is made consumers seem not to feel a lot
of desire to choose something else once their solutions need replacement.

                                                            8/22
3.4.2 Cost

When it comes to cost consumers will directly pay if they are purchasing a device. Services (especially e-mail,
file sharing, photo management, productivity applications) are quite often âfreeâ in that only in specific cases
the consumer has to pay directly but most of the time services are monetised by the controlling companies via
advertising revenue. This makes the direct cost relatively low for many services consumers need, but is has
downsides related to other aspects (see further).

3.4.3 Control of data, privacy and security

All data that consumers generate (photos, videos, social media posts, e-mail messages, etc.) are stored on
servers controlled by the company that offers the solution (device and/or applications) via which this
information is generated and/or stored. The services via which the data is generated will often have user
licence agreements in place that state how generated data can be used by the company concerned. This is
often far broader than what the user feels happy with. However since the user does not have a lot of choice to
begin with they often will have to accept it in order to have a âdigital lifeâ. So consumers very often have - on a
practical level - no control over their data, if control means having the final say about whom is to be allowed
access to it and to what degree access is granted. This situation also results in consumers not having the
degree of privacy that they desire.

3.4.4 Security

Since almost all software regular consumers use is closed source there is no way for them to assess whether or
not the software is safe to use or not. They have to fully rely on what the supplier states in that regard. This
has resulted in situations where hackers have been successful in compromising usersâ devices/services.

3.4.5 Ease of use, implementation and switching

Modern consumer focused devices and services are extremely easy to setup (implement) and to use. The
reasons are twofold: 1. It should be as easy as possible for consumers to make the choice to use them, 2. Lack
of functionality. The latter has to do with suppliers wanting to restrict maintenance and testing costs (the more
functionality the more needs to be maintained and tested with new releases). So ease of use (actually
establishing a low learning curve) quite often goes along with having only a bare minimum of functionality.
Switching to other solutions is often not a good option because of the following reasons:
     ï· It is difficult and cumbersome to transfer data to new services
     ï· Friends and family are using the same proprietary services (e.g. communication services)

4 Issues and goals
4.1 Issues

The previous chapter has shown that there are lots of issues concerning the current situation within the
European digital market. These can be summarised as follows:

    ï·      Business to business (supplier) perspective:
           ï· Problematic market opportunities
           ï· Difficulty getting access to key technologies
    ï·      Business to business (customer) perspective:
           ï· Lack of choice in many cases
           ï· Lack of control regarding data, privacy and security
           ï· Difficulty switching
           ï· Increasing costs
    ï·      Business to consumer (supplier) perspective:
           ï· Problematic market opportunities
           ï· Difficulty getting access to key technologies
    ï·      Business to consumer (customer) perspective:
           ï· Lack of choice in many cases
           ï· Lack of control regarding data, privacy and security
           ï· Difficulty switching

4.2 Goals

The issues mentioned above will logically have to result in the following goals:

    1.     Improving access to key technologies
    2.     Establishment of a more open and competitive digital market
    3.     Improving the ease of switching
    4.     Enablement and/or improvement of self control regarding data, privacy and security

5 Proposal
This proposal will explain a number of presumably very impactful measures that can be carried out with the
idea of improving the issues stated before for European suppliers and customers. Since we are talking of an
extremely impactful changes the market will need sufficient time to adapt. This means that implementation
deadlines of the measures can be spaced out in time as much as required. The following measures (preferably
implemented in the order stated) are proposed:
     ï· Open source software obligation for client layer
     ï· Open hardware specification obligation for client devices
     ï· Open source software obligation for middleware
     ï· Open hardware specification obligation for server devices

5.1 Open source software obligation for client layer

Every organisation that supplies software to a public audience is required to publish the source code of that
software with an open source (preferably a GPL2) licence in such a way that it is publicly available via regular
means (typically files in open formats that can be downloaded from the public part of the internet) of
acquirement. The source code should be published in open (definition: file formats of which the
structure/syntax/usage is not covered by a legal licence, so essentially a format that everyone can use without
legal restrictions) and well understood formats. The obligation for open source software covers all active
components within a client system (system is defined as hardware + software that have a direct dependence,
or in other words all software that requires the hardware to run + the hardware itself) that can be altered by
means of writing code. This includes but is not limited to the following types of software: operating systems,
applications/apps, software libraries/components, hardware drivers. The goal of this obligation is to make sure
that on a typical client device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer) there will be no software
running of which the inner workings are obfuscated.

5.2 Open hardware specification obligation for client devices

Software has to be able to communicate with hardware. In order to do this applications usually communicate
with the operating system which in its turn communicates with the hardware (it is slightly more complex than
that but this description suffices for the purposes of this document). In order to be able to do the latter the
makers of operating systems need to understand the workings of the hardware components within the devices
they wish to be able to support. To ensure this every organisation that supplies client systems to a public
audience will be required to disclose the workings of every hardware component that is part of the systems
provided to such a degree that it will be possible for creators of alternative operating systems to let these
communicate correctly with the hardware that is part of the devices they wish to support. The specifications
should be published publicly in open (definition: file formats of which the structure/syntax/usage is not
covered by a legal licence, so essentially a format that everyone can use without legal restrictions) formats and
in a syntax that is in line with generally accepted conventions within the industry.

5.3 Open source software obligation for middleware layer

This concerns an extension to the open source software obligation for the client layer. It means that all the
software that runs on the server (middleware) that is required to offer the service accessed via client software
will have to meet the same obligations as software running on the client. This will ensure that the total
software stack that is required to operate a service can be understood by everyone who is interested.

5.4 Open hardware specification obligation for server devices

This concerns an extension to the open hardware specification obligation for client devices. It means that with
regard to the hardware (indirectly) used to run the software on the server (middleware) the same obligation
will apply as for client hardware.

6 Future situation
6.1 Effect of proposals to goals
The proposals will have the following effects with respect to the goals stated:

6.1.1 Improving access to key technologies

Proposal                            Effect

Open source software                This will enable (potential) suppliers to (more easily) obtain required
obligation for client layer         technical and functional knowledge of existing services

Open hardware specification         This will enable (potential) suppliers of hardware to (more easily)
obligation for client devices       obtain required technical and functional knowledge of existing client
                                    hardware

Open source software                See âOpen source software obligation for client layerâ
obligation for middleware
layer

Open hardware specification         The effect is similar to what is stated at âOpen hardware
obligation for server devices       specification obligation for client devicesâ but then applies to server
                                    devices

The combined result of all the effects described will be that it will be easier for (potential) suppliers to obtain
information about key technologies that they need to be able to develop alternatives.

6.1.2 Establishment of a more open and competitive digital market

Proposal                            Effect

Open source software                The effect related to this proposal mentioned at âImproving access
obligation for client layer         to key technologiesâ will lead to it being easier for suppliers to
                                    develop client software needed for the creation of competing
                                    services

Open hardware specification         The effect related to this proposal mentioned at âImproving access
obligation for client devices       to key technologiesâ will lead to it being easier for (potential)
                                    suppliers to develop alternative offerings

Open source software                The effect related to this proposal mentioned at âImproving access
obligation for middleware           to key technologiesâ will lead to it being easier for suppliers to
layer                               develop middleware software needed for the creation of competing
                                    services

Open hardware specification         The effect related to this proposal mentioned at âImproving access
obligation for server devices       to key technologiesâ will lead to it being easier for (potential)
                                    suppliers to develop alternative offerings

The general result will be that frustrating competition by means of obfuscating technological details will be far
more difficult than it is in the current situation. The consequence of this will be that (potential) competitors
will have a greater chance to offer alternatives to existing services.

6.1.3 Improving the ease of switching

Proposal                            Effect

Open source software                will contribute in that it will lead to competitors being (more) able to
obligation for client layer         acquire the necessary technical and functional knowledge to
                                    understand competing services and will therefore it will be easier for
                                    them to offer (better) migration options. This will make switching for
                                    their customers easier

Open hardware specification         No effect

The applicable effects mentioned will enable suppliers to develop better migration options for
their customers, resulting in eliminating possible technical/functional hurdles that customers
might experience in current market segments when they want to switch to other providers.

6.1.4 Enablement and/or improvement of self control regarding data, privacy and security

Proposal                            Effect

Open source software                This will make it possible for customers to investigate the workings
obligation for client layer         of the software they use and to establish its security level. It will
                                    also be possible to assess how the client software manages data
                                    and to establish with that the level of privacy that is ensured

Open hardware specification         This will enable customers to investigate the workings of the
obligation for client devices       hardware and to establish its security level. It will will also be
                                    possible to assess to which degree data privacy and security is
                                    sufficiently covered by the hardware concerned

Open source software                The effect of this will be similar to what is stated at âopen source
obligation for middleware           software obligation for client layerâ but applies to the middleware
layer                               software

Open hardware specification         The effect of this will be similar to what is stated at âOpen hardware
obligation for server devices       specification obligation for client devicesâ but applies to server
                                    devices

The combined effect of all proposals will result in organisations and individuals being able to
technically/practically assess the level of data protection, privacy and security a service offers
(instead of having to soly rely on legal assurances given by suppliers).

6.2 Effects per perspective

The effects mentioned in the previous paragraph are expected to have the following impact on a practical
level:

6.2.1 Business to business (supplier)

The following practical changes will be most notable:
    ï· Developing competing services will be easier and at less cost
    ï· Established suppliers will find the market to be more challenging
    ï· Established suppliers will have to invest more in improving customer satisfaction

6.2.2 Business to business (customer)

The following practical changes will be most notable:
    ï· More choice especially in the services realm
    ï· Lower prices (as a result of increased offer)
    ï· Migration to other providers of services will be easier and less costly

6.2.3 Business to consumer (supplier)

Same as âBusiness to business (supplier)â with the addition of:
   ï· Monetisation by means of generating advertising revenue via usage of the data of customers will be
        more challenging

6.2.4 Business to consumer (customer)

The following practical changes will be most notable:
    ï· More choice, especially in the mobile realm (current duopoly will end)
    ï· More choice regarding alternative services
    ï· More choice regarding alternative client applications/apps for existing services
    ï· More control on a practical level with regard to privacy and security
    ï· Migration to other service providers will be easier
    ï· Better integration between communication and social media platforms
    ï· Change of method of monetisation by suppliers

6.3 New market dynamics

The combined effects described will result in a new market dynamics that is totally different from the current
situation. The reason is that every application will be available in open source form. These applications will
have to be (and in principle could be) ported to every operating system that a supplier, non profit organisation
or even an individual person wishes to support or use (e.g. a smartphone manufacturer could in principle
install any operating system on their devices they deem suitable as long as they think available applications
can/will be ported). This porting will have to be done by those who maintain the operating system (e.g.
manufacturers of smartphones, communities, software companies, etc.). Especially companies that sell client
hardware devices (e.g. smartphones) will have to ensure that porting will happen if they want to make their
offerings appealing enough to customers (they will probably be hesitant to buy a smartphone from them if no
applications can be installed because they are not available). This service of porting (and updating once new
versions appear) could even be offered as a paid service for those who feel inclined where they do not only
port but also check the security and privacy of every application to be ported.

6.4 Summary

For suppliers it will be more difficult (not impossible) to differentiate from competitors based on features, ease
of use, etc. because the technology stack will effectively be commoditized. Instead the main aspect of
differentiation from competitors will be the quality and cost of the total service they provide to their
customers and the amount of privacy they ensure. These aspects are therefore expected to improve. Especially
in the consumer market the changes will be profound since consumers for their digital needs currently do not
have a negotiating position since in many cases there are hardly any alternatives for the services they use, and
(if there are) switching is cumbersome on many levels. This situation is expected to change drastically if the
proposals are implemented resulting in a situation where suppliers have no choice but to take their customers
within the consumer market (more) seriously when it comes to customer satisfaction and also when it comes
to another aspect that has always been of importance to many customers but where they are now at the
mercy of those suppliers (they need to accept terms no matter how bad they are otherwise they are not able
to use the service they require), namely privacy. All in all one could say that a clear shift of the balance of
power from suppliers to customers is to be expected as a result of implementing the proposed
recommendations. One could speak therefore of a paradigm shift where instead of a few powerful companies
controlling the total market and solely reaping the benefits of that, society as a whole will have collective
control and therefore will also reap the collective benefits!

7 Expected backlash
7.1 Reasons of objection
The explained proposals will in the humble opinion of the author bring improvement in many ways for many
stakeholders within the digital market space, but of course this will not be the case for all parties that will be
impacted. Especially companies (and possibly governments of countries they reside in) who's market position
strongly depends on holding all the essential cards are expected to oppose the changes vehemently. The
following important arguments against the proposals are likely to be brought forward by them:
     ï· We have invested a lot of money in building up the software stack that made us successful, why
         would we have to share our technology and expertise with our competitors?
     ï· A company that tightly controls the total technology stack needed for a service is more secure than
         opening it up
     ï· Innovation will stop because companies don't want to spend money in software they have to give
         away
     ï· We will not be able to monetise our services effectively any more

The first argument seems legitimate at first glance (because research, development and implementation
indeed costs a lot of money) but the following counter arguments apply as well:
    ï· They have reaped the benefits of the current situation in which they were allowed to grow to (semi)
         monopolies to a very large degree and therefore in many cases the expenses that went into
         developing the current software stack have probably been earned back many times
    ï· (semi) monopolies are simply not acceptable because it stifles fair market practices that are in the
         interest of European citizens and organisations. Resolving this must therefore weigh heavier than the
         interests of a handful of companies

The second argument is one that is often stated by companies that control important segments of the market
but it does not hold up because of the following reasons:
     ï· If software can be scrutinised freely, independent investigators will be able to find security
         vulnerabilities that can be reported more easily. This will contribute to improving the products at
         hand
     ï· It will be more difficult for companies to not address vulnerabilities in ways that do not meet
         reasonable quality standards (because this would immediately be noticed by reporters and
         influencers), which is also better for security due to the incentive of avoiding publicity damage

The third argument does not hold up because if we look at current open source offerings we see a continuous
improvement in the quality and features. This is because everyone who has a stake can contribute to
improvement and will often do so. Or in other words improvements in the form of proposals to change the
software in certain ways, or even direct coding contributions are expected to come from those who directly
benefit from them namely the customers themselves. All in all the dynamics of innovation will change but not
innovation itself!

The fourth argument is of course not true. The reason is that offering services cost money and that applies to
every competitor as well so the playing field will be levelled. Apart from this it has been concluded previously
that monetisation should not or does not necessarily have to come from exploiting the software itself but
could come (more) from monetisation of the quality of service and support. So if one invests in more focus on

the interests of the customer it is still possible to differentiate from competitors and to make money out of
that.

7.2 Should exemptions of the open source obligation be made for sensitive
     applications?

It might be argued that exemptions are needed for sensitive applications for which very high security and/or
privacy standards should apply, like banking, authentication and governmental applications. However when it
comes to security and privacy there are no principal differences between any type of application that deals
with sensitive data on the one hand and the types that are deemed very sensitive on the other. One could
even argue that the obligation of open source should apply specifically to every very sensitive application, so
even more than less sensitive ones since the quality of security is paramount for exactly these types of
applications. Another argument against exempting certain applications is that this could result in a situation
where exempt applications will possibly only be made available for a limited number of operating systems (to
keep the costs of development and maintenance and support as low as possible for the organisations behind
it). This will result in a situation where companies and individuals who are required to use these applications
will have no choice but to opt for a platform supported by these applications that they are obligated to use.
Once they have made the choice for a supporting platform they will probably also use that platform to run all
the other applications they need because one does not want to operate multiple devices. This of course will
defeat the general goal that we have namely decreasing dependence on a few companies that own the
dominating operating systems. But organisations behind the mentioned types of applications might argue that
open sourcing their application will open the door to the creation of ported or alternative versions that could
offer functionality not wanted or not deemed safe by the organisations concerned. This however can be
prevented technically by making sure that every interaction by the user in the application at hand is checked at
the server side before it is committed there. Furthermore banks and companies behind authentication apps
will be able (just like anybody else) to check the code of popular alternatives and ported versions and report
insecurities. The last argument against allowing exemptions concerns the fact that it will not fit in the
explained new market dynamics that is expected and (as far as the author is concerned desired) to occur if the
proposed measures are implemented. Or in other words porting applications will become the norm instead of
the exception and therefore it makes no sense to allow propositions that are antithetic to that.

According to the author the proposed measures will have to be implemented without a single exemption for
the transition to the desired outcome in order to be fully successful. Those who will have to consider the
proposal will have to be fully aware of this!

So the answer to the exemption question should be a resounding 'no'.
