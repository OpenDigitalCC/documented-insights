    OVHCLOUD CONTRIBUTION TO THE CALL FOR EVIDENCE FOR THE INITIATIVE: âTOWARDS EUROPEAN
                                 OPEN DIGITAL ECOSYSTEMSâ

INTRODUCTION

OVHcloud, the leading European cloud provider, welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the European
Commissionâs initiative âTowards European open digital ecosystemsâ, in response to the questions suggested
in the Call for Evidence.

Together with the upcoming Cloud and AI Development Act, these initiatives can provide a coherent
framework to strengthen Europeâs digital sovereignty and competitiveness. Open-source software is a
strategic asset and a key enabler of this objective.

OVHcloud considers open source to be a foundational layer of Europeâs digital infrastructure. It enables
control over critical technologies, reduces dependency and vendor lock-in, supports security and
transparency, and fosters innovation and competition aligned with European values.

Europe already benefits from a large and widely adopted open-source ecosystem, yet it remains fragmented
and structurally fragile. Insufficient long-term funding, weak incentives for upstream contribution, and
reliance on non-European platforms limit its ability to scale and to sustain mission-critical software.

This initiative presents an opportunity for the EU to strengthen its capacity to sustain and adopt open source
through a horizontal and enabling approach. Complementing the Cloud and AI Development Act, such an
approach should focus on shared foundations, ecosystem sustainability, and long-term resilience, ensuring
that open source delivers lasting strategic and economic value for Europe.

ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are the main barriers
   that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source; and (ii)
   sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

The European open-source ecosystem is distinguished by its scale, diversity, and decentralized nature.
According to Harvard Business School (2024), Europe accounts for approximately 18.5 million open-source
contributors, around 15.4% of the global total,1 working across a broad spectrum of technologies, sectors, and
use cases.

This breadth of participation has given rise to numerous vibrant and highly specialized communities, fostering
continuous experimentation, collaboration, and innovation. The ecosystemâs decentralization enhances its
resilience by limiting dependence on individual communities or foundations and reducing the risk of
technological lock-in tied to those maintaining critical projects.

In addition, Europe demonstrates a high level of open-source adoption among public and economic actors. In
France, for instance, the MarkessâCNLLâNumeumâSystematic Open Source Monitor France (2023) reports that
9 out of 10 public organisations and 8 out of 10 private companies rely on open-source technologies.2 Together,
these factors provide Europe with a strong and mature foundation from which to further develop, scale, and
consolidate its open-source capabilities.

Despite its significant potential, the European open-source ecosystem continues to face challenges related to
visibility and understanding, particularly among decision-makers and non-technical stakeholders. The
strategic value of open source is frequently underestimated or insuï¬iciently communicated, limiting its
consideration in policy and investment decisions.

The major structural weakness lies in the lack of long-term, predictable funding mechanisms. While the
ecosystemâs diversity is a key strength, its high level of fragmentation, combined with limited federation and
coordination, hampers the ability of European projects to scale, achieve critical mass, or attain global
leadership. As a result, there are relatively few large-scale, well-resourced communities capable of sustaining
complex, mission-critical software in the long term.

In addition, institutional incentives remain underdeveloped. Existing policies and public procurement
frameworks rarely encourage organisations not only to adopt open-source software, but also to actively
contribute back to the communities that develop and maintain it. This imbalance weakens the sustainability
of the ecosystem and limits Europeâs ability to fully capitalize on its open-source assets.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please provide concrete
   examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation, among others) that
   are most important to assess the added value.

Open-source software delivers substantial added value for both public and private actors by addressing a
range of strategic priorities, including cost control, market competition, vendor lock-in, security and trust, and
innovation capacity. Rather than being only a technical alternative, open source represents a structural
approach to building more resilient and competitive digital systems.

Open-source improves cost eï¬iciency: By reducing or eliminating licensing fees and redirecting investment
toward implementation, customization, integration, and skills development, open-source ensures that digital
spending generates long-term value and local economic activity rather than recurring payments tied to
proprietary licenses. It also lowers barriers to adoption and reduces the total cost of ownership throughout
the software lifecycle.

Open-source promotes healthier and more competitive markets: Competition takes place at the level of
services, support, and innovation instead of being constrained by a single vendorâs technology stack,
roadmap, or pricing model. This dynamic limits monopolistic situations, increases supplier diversity, and
creates stronger incentives for quality and performance.

Open-source reduces vendor lock-in: By granting users the freedom to audit, adapt, and maintain software
independently or through any qualified service provider. This flexibility mitigates long-term operational and
strategic risks, strengthens business continuity, and enhances negotiation power.

Open-source strengthens security, transparency, and trust: Public access to source code enables independent
audits and peer review, helping vulnerabilities to be identified and addressed more quickly. Transparency also
supports accountability and confidence in software used for sensitive or high-impact use cases.

Open-source is a driver of innovation and agility: By enabling reuse, collaboration, and rapid iteration, open-
source allows organizations to build on existing components rather than duplicating eï¬ort, reducing time to
market and increasing adaptability.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the development and
   growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and
   cybersecurity agenda?

To support the development and long-term growth of the European open-source ecosystem, and to directly
contribute to the EUâs objectives in technological sovereignty and cybersecurity, the European Union should
implement a coordinated set of measures:

                                                                                                              2/4
1) Establish a clear EU industrial policy for open-source: The EU should explicitly recognize open-source
   as a strategic industrial asset. Rather than prioritizing specific products, this should focus on
   strengthening core, cross-cutting technological foundations, especially in priority domains such as cloud,
   cybersecurity, data infrastructure and AI stacks; mapping critical technological dependencies to
   understand where Europe relies on external components and where risks are concentrated; and aligning
   open-source priorities with broader EU industrial, security, and resilience agendas. A clear policy
   framework of this kind would create predictability for investment and send a strong signal that open-
   source is a foundational pillar of European digital capability-building.

2) Support open-source communities while reducing fragmentation through stronger federation:
   Europe benefits from a rich and diverse open-source landscape, but excessive fragmentation can limit the
   ability of projects to scale. The EU can preserve this diversity while increasing collective eï¬ectiveness by
   supporting communities through financial support, while also funding cross-community coordination
   and shared tools. At the same time, establishing a large-scale European open-source foundation could
   provide a strong backbone for the ecosystem by supporting foundational building blocks, ensuring
   continuity, and oï¬ering governance and legal support. The objective would not be to centralize the
   ecosystem, but to enable European open source to reach critical mass through better coordination and
   structural support.

3) Reduce strategic dependence on non-European platforms and infrastructure: Technological
   sovereignty extends beyond source code to include the platforms, hosting environments, and governance
   mechanisms that underpin the software development lifecycle. The EU could support European
   alternatives for code hosting (i.e.: GitHub), continuous integration and delivery. It could also enable public
   and critical infrastructure actors to rely on EU-hosted or interoperable development and collaboration
   platforms, while ensuring portability so projects are not structurally tied to a single non-European
   provider. While reliance on global tools will remain necessary, the EU should avoid situations where
   critical open-source workflows are dependent on a single stakeholder.

4) Incentivize upstream contributions from organisations using open source: The sustainability of the
   European open-source ecosystem depends on moving beyond a consumption-based model. The EU can
   encourage greater reinvestment by introducing mechanisms that promote, or require, upstream
   contributions when public funding is used to develop or adapt open-source software. The aim is to
   normalize contribution as a standard element of responsible digital operations rather than an optional or
   philanthropic activity.

5) Invest in education, skills, and sustainable career pathways for maintainers: Finally, long-term
   resilience requires sustained investment in skills. The EU should strengthen the talent pipeline by
   integrating open-source development practices into higher education and vocational training,
   recognizing open-source development and maintainership as a professional role, and supporting
   fellowships, apprenticeships, and mobility programmes across European ecosystems.

4. What technology areas should be prioritized and why?

The EU should adopt a horizontal and enabling approach to open-source. Selecting particular areas or end
solutions indeed risks locking public investment into short-lived choices, duplicating market or community
eï¬orts, and reducing flexibility in the face of rapid technological change.

Instead, the EU should focus on financing the shared technological foundations that all digital sectors rely on
(core infrastructure software, developer tools, security and trust components, interoperability layers), and the
long-term maintenance, governance, and documentation capacities that keep these building blocks reliable
and secure. By investing in the means to build rather than in end products, the EU maximizes reuse across
sectors, avoids competing with existing ecosystems, and enables public administrations, companies, and
communities to develop context-specific solutions.

                                                                                                             3/4
This horizontal approach does not preclude strategic focus. The EU can and should prioritize foundational
technology domains where structural dependencies remain strongest â such as cloud infrastructure,
cybersecurity, data infrastructures, and AI stacks â and which form the critical base upon which other digital
technologies are built.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open-source lead to increased competitiveness and cyber
   resilience?

An increased use of open-source can strengthen both competitiveness and cyber-resilience across all critical
sectors, including public administrations, operators of essential and vital services, and innovation-driven
industries.

These sectors rely on complex digital infrastructures, and open source can reduce dependency on single
vendors, improve transparency and auditability, and enable faster identification and remediation of
vulnerabilities. In the public sector, it supports sovereignty, accountability, and long-term cost control, while
for operators of essential services, it enhances resilience through interoperability and the ability to adapt
systems without contractual or technical lock-in. For innovation-intensive industries, open-source is a key
enabler of competitiveness, allowing companies to build on shared foundations, protect their innovations by
retaining control over critical technologies, and accelerate time to market.

CONCLUSION

Open source is a strategic asset for Europe, underpinning digital sovereignty, cybersecurity, and
competitiveness. While Europe benefits from a rich and widely adopted open-source ecosystem, its long-term
sustainability requires stronger structural support. Fragmentation, limited funding, and insufficient incentives
for contribution continue to constrain Europeâs ability to maintain and scale critical digital technologies.

The EU should therefore adopt a horizontal and enabling approach that recognizes open source as a
foundational layer of the European digital stack. By investing in shared foundations, maintenance, skills, and
governance, while aligning these efforts with the Cloud and AI Development Act, the EU can ensure that open
source delivers lasting resilience, innovation, and strategic autonomy for Europe.
