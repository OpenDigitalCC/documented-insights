          CONTRIBUTION TO THE CALL FOR EVIDENCE:
            EUROPEAN OPEN DIGITAL ECOSYSTEMS

 Subject: Strategic Recommendations for EU Technological Sovereignty
       through Open-Source Ecosystems Date: 02 February 2026

Submitted by: Amila Kothalawala, Senior System Engineer Location: Lithuania (EU)

Professional Context & Background

I am a Freelancing Senior System Engineer currently operating in Lithuania. My expertise lies in
designing cost effective, secure infrastructure using OpenSource technologies like Proxmox. Having
successfully implemented private cloud architectures in both government and private sectors (in Sri
Lanka and the EU), I have witnessed how opensource solutions can drastically reduce costs while
enhancing security.

Strategic Proposal: From "Consumer" to "Global Provider"

Currently, Europe often acts as a consumer of nonEU proprietary technologies. To strengthen the Euro
and the internal market, the EU must transition to becoming a producer and exporter of open digital
solutions.

    ââ Internal Product Development: The EU should incentivize the creation of "Union made"
       orchestration and AI platforms. Instead of relying on black box external AI models where data
       privacy is uncertain, the EU can build transparent, opensource AI infrastructures where data
       remains strictly within EU borders.

    ââ Exporting Expertise, Not Just Data: By establishing specialized training hubs within the EU, we
       can train a workforce capable of deploying and supporting these European solutions globally.
       This creates a model where Europe exports high value "Consulting and Support Services" rather
       than importing software licenses.

Professional Context & Background

With the rapid rise of AI, relying on backend systems hosted outside the EU poses a significant risk of
data leakage and surveillance.

    ââ The Risk: When using proprietary external AI/Cloud platforms, we lack visibility into how data
       is processed in the backend.

    ââ The Solution: Building competitive, localized Public Cloud and Data Center infrastructures
       within the EU using opensource stacks (like Proxmox and localized Kubernetes). This ensures
       that sensitive European data never leaves the Union's jurisdiction, adhering strictly to GDPR and
       sovereignty goals.

Economic Impact & Talent Retention

Investing in a robust opensource ecosystem addresses the "Brain Drain" issue:

    ââ Job Creation: By creating a market for local support and development of these tools, IT
       professionals will find high value opportunities within the EU, reducing the need to migrate
       elsewhere.

    ââ Cost Optimization: Shifting government and enterprise workloads from expensive hyperscalers
       to EU hosted opensource clouds will save billions in licensing fees. These savings can be
       redirected to R&D and infrastructure hardening.

Conclusion & Recommendations

I urge the Commission to view Open Source not just as a cost saving measure, but as a geopolitical asset.

    ââ Recommendation 1: Establish funding for "EU OpenSource Centers of Excellence" to train
       engineers in maintaining and selling support for European opensource products.

    ââ Recommendation 2: Mandate "Open First" procurement policies for critical infrastructure to
       prevent vendor lockin and ensure data remains within the EU.
