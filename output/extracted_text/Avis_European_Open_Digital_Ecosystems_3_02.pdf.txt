                Contribution to the "Open Digital Ecosystem" Initiative

                                                                                           January 2026

Introduction: A Commitment to Technological Openness
Mobivia, European leader in automotive maintenance and repair (Norauto, Midas, ATU, etc.),
welcomes this European Commission initiative. We strongly support investments in an Open Source
software-defined vehicle (SDV) core stack, particularly through projects such as the Chips Joint
Undertaking.

For Mobivia, this initiative is an essential lever to ensure EU technological sovereignty, strengthen
digital trust and software architecture security, and unlock the value-creation potential of data - all
while preserving a competitive aftermarket in the face of closed proprietary ecosystems.

1. Value Added of Open Source for the Automotive Sector
The adoption of a common open-source foundation offers major strategic advantages:
    ââ Innovation and Competitiveness: By leveraging open standards, Europe can foster the
       emergence of innovative services (predictive maintenance, energy management) developed
       by a wide range of stakeholders, rather than just vehicle manufacturers (OEMs).
    ââ Cyber-resilience and Trust: Unlike "black box" solutions, an open-source environment
       based on standardized APIs allows for transparent auditing of security protocols, reinforcing
       the confidence of both users and regulators.
    ââ Technical Neutrality: Open source would help pivot away from the exclusive proprietary
       "Extended Vehicle" model, where third-party players remain entirely dependent on
       manufacturer-controlled infrastructures.

2. Barriers to Adoption and Structural Weaknesses
Despite the potential of open source, several critical hurdles remain in current vehicle architectures:
    ââ Architectural Lock-in: Manufacturers currently act as "Gatekeepers." Without an open
       on-board application platform, third parties cannot run their own algorithms on-board, creating
       a massive market asymmetry.
    ââ Exclusion of Strategic Data: Currently, up to 99% of data remains within the vehicle without
       being exported. Critical indicators (failure prediction, battery State of Health - SoH) are often
       classified as proprietary "inferred data," placing them outside the scope of the Data Act and
       depriving independent players of high-tech added value.
    ââ Cybersecurity as a Pretext: UN Regulation No. 155 is sometimes invoked to justify
       discriminatory practices that restrict interface access. Mobivia calls for these deviations to be
       documented to ensure that security does not become a tool for commercial lock-in.

3. Mobiviaâs Recommendations for Concrete Implementation
To ensure the Commission's initiative achieves its objectives, Mobivia advocates for the following
actions:

A. Guaranteeing "Functional Equivalence"

The European SDV core stack must allow independent operators to access the same computing
resources and interfaces as the manufacturers' authorized networks. Since third parties cannot yet
produce their own on-board intelligence, they must be able to use the vehicle's native diagnostic and
predictive capabilities.

B. Promoting "Open Platforms" and Standardized APIs
Europe must mandate convergence toward open APIs. This would:
    ââ Mutualize technical access costs for SMEs.
    ââ Guarantee the portability of maintenance history.
    ââ Ensure cybersecurity relies on universal, audited protocols (such as OAuth2) rather than
       opaque proprietary barriers.

C. Ensuring Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Neutrality

Exclusive control of the dashboard screen allows manufacturers to capture customers at critical
moments (e.g., "Fault detected, visit your official dealer"). An open-source ecosystem must guarantee
neutral, non-discriminatory information to preserve the consumer's freedom of choice.

D. Strengthening Supervision and Transparency

The implementation of this core stack must be accompanied by a monitoring authority capable of
auditing access cost structures and sanctioning abuses of dominant positions with deterrent penalties
(modeled after the GDPR).

4. Conclusion
Investing in an open-source core stack for software-defined vehicles is a historic opportunity for
Europe. By breaking down proprietary silos, the Commission can create a high-performance digital
ecosystem where data serves European excellence, innovation, and service development. This will
ensure the interoperability of on-board and remote software architectures, data security, consumer
interest protection, fair competition, the Right to Repair, and the long-term viability of independent
operators. Mobivia stands ready to contribute its technical expertise to make this project an
operational reality.
