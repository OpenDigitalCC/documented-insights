The Interactions Research Group at the University of St. Gallen welcomes the
Commissionâs initiative on Open-Source Digital Ecosystems and especially supports an
open-source strategy that advances citizen-centric autonomy, strong privacy protection, open
innovation, and reduced dependence on foreign technologiesâwithout compromising global
interoperability and connectivity. The group investigates technology-mediated interactions in
complex socio-technical systems, with a particular focus on human-centered, autonomous, and
pervasive computing environments. Our work spans open and adaptive systems, cyber-physical
systems, multi-agent systems, and regulatory-aware computing, and regularly engages with the
societal, economic, and governance implications of digital infrastructures. Based on our
research and experience with deploying and governing open systems, we view open digital
ecosystems as a foundational requirement for transparency, accountability, and long-term
European technological sovereignty.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU
open-source sector?

What are the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and
maintenance of high-quality and secure open source; and (ii)
sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

(i) Adoption and Maintenance

Adoption of OSS is not an issue in general, but it is specific to domains or stacks. For example,
Kubernetes, a tool to provide highly available web services, is a de-facto industry standard
despite the fact that it is OSS. To give another example, the â2025 Open Source Security and
Risk Analysis reportâ of Black Duck Software found that 97% of their analysed code bases
contained OSS. However, in some parts of the technology stack or even in whole domains,
adoption is lower, as we will point in the following section.

Fear of Liability in High Risk Applications and Resulting Regulatory Requirements
In high risk applications, for example in the driving function stack in the automotive industry,
OSS is often not adopted because of the risk of liability. If a faulty piece of OSS leads to liability,
e.g., an autonomous vehicle causing an accident, the company that adopted OSS in their stack
is liable. To externalize the resulting economical risk, certified/proprietary software provided by
suppliers is often preferred. Additionally, because of that risk, software development processes
in automotive are highly regulated. The required documents to comply with the regulation often
simply do not exist for OSS. Developing all OSS according to automotive standards is
impractical as is providing said documents retrospectively. Both, the risk of liability and the
regulation to mitigate liability, are two major challenges for adoption and consequently also
maintenance of OSS in Industry.

Low Availability of OSS-Powered Devices in the Consumer Market and Low Perceived
User Experience
Consumers still perceive the user experience of OSS operating systems as inferior to
proprietary solutions. While the user experience of, e.g., some Linux distribution increased to a
level that non-digital-native may use it without issues, the offer of devices that come without an
OSS operating system is limited. Owners are free to install a different OS after the purchase but
a system installation already requires a skill level that exceeds the average usersâ knowledge
and/or willingness, hampering the adoption of OSS operating systems in the consumer market.
This is not only the case for computers, but also for smartphones. Base Android is OSS but
nearly all default installations of Android by major smartphone manufacturers are proprietary
variations, e.g., including Google apps. The alternative iOS is a proprietary OS and other
alternatives to Android and iOS are marginal.

Perceived Low Deployability to OSS- and EU-Infrastructure
As mentioned before, consumers still perceive the user experience of OSS operating systems
as inferior to proprietary solutions, but this is not limited to the consumer market. Similarly, the
developer experience of deploying and operating services on an EU- or OSS-infrastructure is
falling behind those of proprietary solutions. Today, BigTech platforms offer an unmatched
developer experience: students, independent developers, startups, and researchers, can deploy
and host services via Cloud services globally with minimal effort, often in just a few clicks and at
no cost. Outside these ecosystems, achieving comparable deployability remains
disproportionately complex and resource-intensive, creating huge incentives to host and deploy
on non-EU commercial platforms. Strengths of the EU open-source sector are the existing
initiatives that already provide important building blocks; EuroHPC offers world-class compute
capacity, and IPCEIs have mobilized significant investment in cloud and edge infrastructure.
This gap is not primarily a lack of compute capacity, but a lack of developer-facing, open, and
frictionless deployment infrastructure. The EU assets mentioned above are largely inaccessible
to everyday developers and small actors due to high adoption barriers, administrative
complexity, and the absence of integrated, easy-to-use deployment workflows. Lessons learned
from Gaia-X are particularly relevant: interoperability frameworks and governance models alone
are insufficient if they do not result in concrete, usable services for developers.

(ii) Sustainable Contributions
Desynced Communities and Companies
Companies often do not perceive a contribution to OSS as beneficial but as investment without
return or, in the worst case, as investment into the competition. Contributions that flow back from
the community remain hidden. For example, a bug that is fixed by the community is silently
incorporated into the code base without causing resource allocation to implement, delegate or
mitigate its consequences. As a result, if a company uses OSS and issues are found and fixed,
the contributions are kept in private forks. This creates overhead during maintenance and
ultimately leads to divergence thereby destroying the main benefit of OSS.

No OSS Communities Facilitation
Since OSS communities rely on unpaid efforts of volunteers, they often struggle with finding
contributors. The resulting conditions can facilitate security vulnerabilities, as has been
demonstrated in the case of xzutils.

2. What is the added value of open source for the
public and private sectors?

Please provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as
cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation, among others) that are
most important to assess the added value.

As mentioned in the first question, in some domains or parts of the technology stack, OSS is
highly adopted, demonstrating the economical value that it brings to commercial applications.
For example, the business model of Red Hat OpenShift is entirely based on OSS (Kubernetes,
in this case) and provided as OSS itself. Since Kubernetes solves a problem that came with
containerization, it would not exist, if Docker had not open-sourced their containerization in the
first place. Besides saving costs for inhouse, custom software solutions, the added value of
OSS is that it can probably trigger a chain of innovations from which both private and public
sectors benefit tremendously. In this case, the innovation decreased outages of web services
and time to market of new software products.
The predominance of proprietary operating systems in the consumer market significantly
hampers such innovation dynamics. Hardware manufacturers increasingly prioritize drivers and
optimizations for a small number of dominant proprietary operating systems, reinforcing
technical lock-in and creating high switching costs for users, developers, and public
administrations. This feedback loop limits competition, constrains user choice, and structurally
disadvantages alternative and open platforms, including those developed or governed within the
EU. More critically, the widespread use of proprietary consumer operating systems is often
conditional on extensive data collection practices that are opaque to users and difficult to
meaningfully opt out of. In the age of data-driven and AI-based services, this results in a
systematic transfer of behavioral, biometric, and contextual data to a small number of
non-European actors. This data asymmetry provides these actors with a durable competitive
advantage in AI development, platform optimization, and market expansionâadvantages that
European companies and public-interest actors cannot realistically replicate under current
conditions.

These dynamics are fundamentally misaligned with core European values and policy objectives.
Pervasive data extraction undermines the principles of data minimization, purpose limitation,
and user autonomy enshrined in EU data protection law. Concentrated control over operating
systems and data pipelines weakens individual freedom of choice, erodes meaningful consent,
and limits the ability of public authorities to enforce European regulatory standards. At a societal
level, this model fosters forms of surveillance capitalism and techno-feudal dependencies,
where users, developers, and even states become structurally reliant on opaque, non-auditable
infrastructures governed outside the EUâs democratic and legal framework. In contrast,
open-source operating systems and software stacks enable transparency, auditability, and
contestability at the foundational layers of the digital ecosystem. They allow public and private
actors to verify data flows, adapt systems to local legal and societal requirements, and retain
control over critical digital infrastructure. From a European perspective, the added value of open
source therefore extends beyond cost savings or innovation efficiency: it is a prerequisite for
aligning digital infrastructure with fundamental rights, democratic accountability, and long-term
technological sovereignty.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be
taken at EU level to support the development and
growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute
to the EUâs technological sovereignty and
cybersecurity agenda?
Foster OSS Communities
The key to any OSS endeavor lies within the community that builds and maintains the OSS
project. We propose A.) to make companies, small and large, an integral part of these
communities and B.) to fund individuals that contribute to OSS that is relevant to the EU.

   A.â Make companies an integral part of the OSS communitiesâ
       This could be achieved by a risk fund that partly re-imburses if faulty OSS leads to
       liabilities. The fund could be covered to both, financial contributions of companies to the
       risk fund as well their proven relevant and sustainable contributions to OSS projects.
   B.â Fund individuals who contribute to OSS projectsâ
       These projects might be twofold; it could be available for specific contributions that are in
       the interest of the EU or consist of reimbursement for proven relevant and sustainable
       contributions to OSS projects. Only EU citizens should be able to apply for the funding.
       For the first case, the EU could provide a dedicated market place for freelance work. The
       Archlinux User Repository has a voting system to indicate interest in packages.
       Providing such a feature in the market place could also democratize what is in the
       interest of the EU or be used as an indicator for the relevance.

Strengthen the Offer of OSS-powered Consumer Devices
   -â   Consumer PCs should be available with a preinstalled open-source operating system
        (e.g., a Linux distribution) as a standard variant alongside proprietary alternatives. In
        principle, such devices should be cheaper due to the absence of licensing fees. In
        practice, however, current manufacturing and supply-chain processes are often
        optimized for a single default operating system, making alternative installations more
        costly. EU-level measures should therefore focus on reducing these structural
        frictionsâfor example through public procurement, support for standardized installation
        and certification workflows, or temporary cost-offset mechanismsâso that OSS-based
        variants are not priced at a disadvantage.â

   -â   Smartphone manufacturers should ensure the availability of open-source Android
        configurations alongside proprietary variants, or provide technically straightforward
        mechanisms to replace proprietary components with OSS alternatives. This would
        reduce long-term lock-in to proprietary mobile ecosystems while preserving innovation
        and competition at the platform level.â

   -â   Consumer smartphones should provide access to at least one open and interoperable
        mechanism for application distribution outside proprietary app store ecosystems. The
        objective is to guarantee user choice, transparency, and contestability, rather than to
        mandate a specific solution. Open-source app stores (e.g., F-Droid) serve as concrete
        examples of such mechanisms.
Increase Deployability to OSS- and EU-Infrastructure Demonstrate
To be effective, European deployability infrastructure must prioritize practical outcomes such as
standardized open-source cloud stacks, self-service access, predictable pricing (or free tiers),
and simple deployment pipelines comparable to those offered by hyperscalers and Big Tech.
The EU should therefore ensure that publicly funded compute, cloud, and data center
resourcesâwhether under EuroHPC, IPCEIs, or successor initiativesâare complemented by
open, developer-centric platforms that enable âdeploy with two clicksâ experiences for
open-source projects. Making sovereign infrastructure usable by developers is a prerequisite for
reducing dependency on proprietary platforms.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and
why?

Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is becoming a basic industrial/commercial/military infrastructure and will
likely be a core economic basis in the next few years. In order to become independent from
proprietary providers, it is essential that the software stack of AI, including training data,
algorithms to train and run AI, and AI model weights themselves, are all open source.

Data Ecosystems / Open Data
Open and interoperable data ecosystems are a prerequisite for sustained innovation, fair
competition, and European technological sovereignty. Today, many European companies rely on
proprietary data infrastructures and platforms operated outside the EU, resulting in data flows
(âdata pipesâ) that leave the continent and create long-term strategic dependencies. This
weakens Europeâs ability to retain economic value, to enforce its regulatory framework, and to
develop independent digital capabilities.
Strengthening open data ecosystems would improve access to data for European actors,
reduce vendor lock-in, and foster innovation across sectors. In this context, decentralized data
stores represent a particularly important direction, as they align with core European values such
as user control, privacy, and decentralization. Open specifications such as SOLID (Social Linked
Data) provide a concrete and mature technical foundation for such ecosystems. Solid defines an
architecture in which individuals or organizations store their data in personal data pods that are
logically and administratively decoupled from the applications that access them. Applications
interact with data via standardized, open protocols and semantic web technologies, rather than
through proprietary APIs or platform-specific data silos. This separation of data storage from
application logic enables users and organizations to retain control over where their data resides,
who can access it, and for what purposes. Despite their technical maturity, Solid-based
approaches have so far seen limited adoption, primarily due to the lack of user-friendly
interfaces, developer tooling, and large-scale reference deployments. Targeted EU support
could therefore play a decisive role by funding production-ready implementations, integrating
Solid-based data stores into public-sector digital services, and promoting their use in strategic
domains such as health, mobility, and public administration. Doing so would reduce structural
dependence on non-EU data platforms, strengthen European data autonomy, and enable open,
competitive, and privacy-preserving data ecosystems.

Operating Systems
Given current geopolitics and US administration, the dependency of Europe on Windows, Apple,
and other US-owned products is a major strategic risk. The use of open source operating
systems (e.g., Linux distributions, BSD distributions) would contribute in making Europe more
independent from US providers. While the Linux Foundation, supervising the development of
the Linux kernel and other open source projects, is hosted in the US, open source operating
systems can be more easily audited, and improved.

User Agents and Information Filtering Systems
User agentsâincluding web browsers, recommender systems (for example those used in
decentralized social networks such as Bluesky), and emerging AI agentsâhave become critical
digital intermediaries that determine how users access, filter, and prioritize information. As such,
they directly influence public discourse, economic behavior, and democratic processes. In line
with the objectives of the Digital Services Act (DSA), increased transparency and auditability of
recommender and ranking systems is essential to enable meaningful oversight, risk
assessment, and user choice. Open-source implementations of user agents and recommender
systems provide a concrete and effective means to achieve these objectives by enabling
independent inspection, verification, and accountability.
From a Digital Markets Act (DMA) perspective, dominant proprietary user agents act as
gatekeepers that reinforce lock-in, self-preferencing, and dependency on non-EU platforms.
Supporting open and interoperable user agents is therefore necessary to lower barriers to entry,
foster competition, and ensure contestability in downstream digital markets. Finally, media
pluralism and freedom of information require that information filtering mechanisms are not
controlled by a small number of opaque actors. Open-source user agents allow users and
public-interest actors to understand, adapt, and diversify information curation logic, thereby
strengthening pluralism and resilience against manipulation. For these reasons, the EU must
prioritise the development, adoption, and deployment of open-source user agents and
information filtering systems as a core component of its digital sovereignty, regulatory
enforcement, and democratic resilience agenda.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open
source lead to increased competitiveness and cyber
resilience?
We specifically suggested how to address OSS adoption in high risk applications, which include
automotive and transport. We also proposed how to strengthen the ties between company and
community contributors, which is domain independent. Considering the report of Black Duck
Software (see question 1), which showed that 97% of their analysed code bases contain OSS,
this would affect a lot of sectors. Similarly, improved deployability could yield a domain
independent, cross-sector improvement.

Software infrastructure consists of shared, foundational software components that support the
development, execution, and operation of applications. Such categories of software include OS,
browsers, AI infrastructure (e.g., LLM weights, training data, code to train or run a model), and
software that is being used to control physical devices (e.g., drivers) We consider that it is
crucial for this type of software to be open source. This is of importance for many reasons:
    -â Individual consumer (privacy, freedom of choice,...)
    -â Administration (sovereignty)
    -â Strategic (dependency of critical infrastructure)
    -â Maintainability

Beyond foundational software infrastructure, data ecosystems and user agents are
cross-sectoral areas where increased use of open source can significantly improve
competitiveness and cyber resilience. Open and interoperable data ecosystems are critical
across sectors such as health, mobility, energy, manufacturing, and public administration.
Open-source data infrastructures reduce vendor lock-in, strengthen data sovereignty, and
enable transparent, auditable data governance, thereby improving both resilience and
innovation capacity. Similarly, user agentsâincluding browsers, recommender systems, and
emerging AI agentsâact as key intermediaries between users, services, and data. Open-source
user agents increase transparency and accountability, reduce gatekeeper power, and support
regulatory oversight, contributing to market contestability, democratic resilience, and
cybersecurity across sectors.
