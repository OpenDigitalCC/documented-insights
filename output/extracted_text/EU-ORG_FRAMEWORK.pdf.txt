EU-ORG: a European Framework for
cross-border non-profits
How to attract open-source governance organisations to Europe.

The Paradox of Open-Source Governance in Europe

Europe leads the world in open-source contributions, with studies consistently showing that
European developers and organizations are among the most active globally. Yet, the
governance of open-source remains overwhelmingly U.S.-centric.

Major foundations - such as the Linux Foundation, Python Software Foundation (PSF),
Apache Software Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Open Source Initiative (OSI), and
NumFOCUS - are incorporated in the United States. While some have established European
chapters and present themselves as global organisations, their core governance, funding,
and operational decisions remain tied to U.S. legal and cultural frameworks. This creates a
striking imbalance: despite Europeâs outsized contributions, funding, priorities, and jobs are
concentrated in the U.S., reinforcing a U.S.-centric bias that can misalign with European
values like data sovereignty, privacy, and multilingualism.

A Framework for European Open-Source Sovereignty

To address this imbalance, Europe must foster the creation of independent governance
structures incorporated on its own soil - not just as regional branches of U.S.-led
organizations, but as fully autonomous entities. These organizations could better reflect
European legal frameworks, cultural diversity, and strategic interests.

A critical step toward achieving this would be the establishment of a dedicated European
legal entity for cross-border non-profits. This new âEU-ORG", inspired by initiatives like
the âEU-INCâ, would:

   -â   Simplify the process of creating and managing cross-border non-profits in Europe,
        which are not perceived as being associated with any specific member of the Union.
   -â   Provide a clear legal framework for funding, governance, and operations.

By enabling such structures, Europe can provide a welcoming and stable framework to
attract open-source governance organizations to Europe, and foster an ecosystem built
with European values at its core.
