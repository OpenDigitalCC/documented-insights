 Response to the European Open Digital
    Ecosystems call for evidence by
     VideoLAN, the creators of VLC

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU
open-source sector? What are the main barriers that
hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality
and secure open source; and (ii) sustainable
contributions to open-source communities?

Strength:
  â¢   There is a strong culture of volunteering across many EU countries, supported
      by a strong social safety net and a keen interest in working for the public
      good.
  â¢   Across Europe we see a rich tradition of open source. The best open source
      solutions used around the world are largely developed in Europe. We can find
      undeniable success across many different industries and sectors.
  â¢   Open Source software has proven to be an efficient use of resources due to
      its high reusability:
          â¦ The pooling of resources that open source allows benefits all actors
             and makes the solutions cheaper for the general public.
          â¦ World-class open source software such as VLC has been developed by
             small teams with small budgets.
          â¦ Solutions once developed can be reused by other players without
             having to redevelop the same solution. Instead they can improve the
             existing solution and extend it to fit their needs.
  â¢   There is a focus on building long-term sustainable solutions in the Open
      Source community rather than sways in the market.

Weaknesses:
  â¢   Unwillingness to make large long-term investments in Open Source solutions
      and communities.
  â¢   Lack of general funding.
  â¢   There is a proven record of lobbying influence by large corporations working
      against the public interest and Open Source.
  â¢   Recognition and awareness of excellent existing open source communities
      and solutions is lacking.
  â¢   Political willpower sways depending on current trends rather than the long
      term needs.
  â¢   Adoption of an Open Source solution often does not result in financial
      investments, especially by institutional and corporate players. This leads to a
      situation where the creators of the technology do not have enough resources
      to maintain it sustainably. In effect, links in the technology supply chain are
      relied on and taken for granted, but can be weak in reality.

2. What is the added value of open source for the
public and private sectors? Please provide concrete
examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk,
lock-in, security, innovation, among others) that are
most important to assess the added value.
      â¢   Transparency, which increases security, and increases trust.
      â¢   Ability to switch solutions and providers to avoid vendor lock-in.
      â¢   Real ownership over the solution and the knowledge that surrounds it.
          Adoption does not submit the user to the will of the provider.
      â¢   Long time support of numerous formats forever.
      â¢   Real collaboration is possible between different groups. People with
          different interests can collaborate to make good solutions for everyone.
      â¢   The largest tech companies are in the USA and the profits they generate
          in the EU (by customers and public institutions) currently go to the USA
          instead of supporting the economy of the EU. This could be changed with
          the use of open source software.
      â¢   Acceleration of product and service development starting from a common,
          shared resource base.
      â¢   Large reduction in cost, since solutions do not need to be re-developed
          multiple times.
3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken
at EU level to support the development and growth of
the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?
    â¢   Wide adoption of solutions created within the EU, especially Open Source
        solutions.
    â¢   Creation of a EU Sovereign Tech Fund to support the maintenance of
        critical infrastructure open source software.
    â¢   Require other institutions to contribute back to Open Source projects
        (financially or otherwise) when they adopt and use their solutions.
    â¢   Proper legal and financial consequences when the lack of usage of Open
        Source has negative consequences. These negative consequences include
        solutions going out of support, security issues and bugs that cannot be
        addressed due to lack of access, security breaches that cannot be
        scrutinised and more.
    â¢   Get the European Commission, Parliament to use open source and ban
        non-open source non-european solutions.
    â¢   Reduce software patents usage.
    â¢   Tax incentives of using open source.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and
why?
    â¢   Consumer technology because it affects the wider population, including
        media, documents, format and collaboration tech.
    â¢   Interoperability of formats and protocols.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open
source lead to increased competitiveness and cyber
resilience?
    â¢   Public administration: Governments would be less dependent on non-EU
        tech companies and have more ownership and transparency over the
        deployed solutions. In addition the data they hold would not leave the EU.
    â¢   Education: The EU needs to train people on open source technology early
        so they are not locked into non-sovereign solutions long-term.
    â¢   Consumer technology: The technology EU citizens use every day
        (multimedia applications, browsers, desktops, messaging applications, ...)
        should have viable and attractive Open Source solutions. This will make it
    less likely for them to be exposed to bad actors taking them over and the
    financial interests of the companies operating them, which will not align
    with the best interests of the EU public.
â¢   Social media: Public opinion and news consumption these days is largely
    shaped by social media. It needs to be owned and operated on open
    source solutions by public-interest organisations in order to work for the
    benefit of citizens.
â¢   Industry: The shared technology base provided by Open Source forms a
    critical part of the supply chain used in technology products developed
    and exported from Europe. Unlike usually foreign-originated proprietary
    technology it is not subject to trade restrictions and tariffs and instead
    offers guaranteed availability. As a result, industry retains the ability to
    develop, improve, manufacture and offer products and services in
    uncertain political climates.
