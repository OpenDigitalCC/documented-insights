As an active participant in the European legislative framework, Clever Cloud engages with critical initiatives
aimed at enhancing Europeâs digital sovereignty. We contribute to the development of key frameworks such as
the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the EU Cybersecurity Act and of course the forthcoming EU Cloud and AI
Development act among others... Our involvement in organizations like Eurosmart, European Alliance for
Industrial Data, Edge & Cloud, France Digitale, the Open Internet Project, and CISPE reflects our commitment to
advocating for robust European certification schemes and ensuring that the cloud infrastructure respects and
protects user rights. Through partnerships with leading European technology firms while preserving market
freedom. In fact, we are building a cohesive digital ecosystem that fosters innovation, real free competition while
preserving individual freedoms. Our dedication to creating and contributing to open-source projects further
demonstrates our belief in collaboration as a means to strengthen Europeâs digital sovereignty.

At Clever Cloud, we recognize that true digital sovereignty is essential for economic resilience and technological
independence. By championing strategic policies and fostering a community of like-minded stakeholders, we are
committed to shaping a future where Europeâs digital landscape remains robust, secure, and innovative. Since
2019, Clever Cloud is highly concerned about the future economic prosperity of Europe.

As a matter of fact, in the realm of the consultation on the European Open Digital Ecosystem and regarding the
current American digital hegemony we do call for the establishment of a European Digital Commons Foundation.

Executive Summary
The Problem
The European Union is currently facing market concentration when it comes to the software
market. Two American companies control the fundamental software infrastructure of the
modern economy: Microsoft (office suites, operating systems) and Google (browsers, web
standards).

According to the Asteres report commissioned by CIGREF and Numeum (April 2025),
Europe spends â¬264 billion annually on American cloud and software servicesâa digital
bill comparable to our entire energy import bill (â¬360 billion) and representing 1.5% of EU
GDP. An estimated 83% of European large enterprise spending on cloud and software goes
to US providers, with 80% of the value added created in the United States. This supports
nearly 2 million jobs in America while Europe remains digitally dependent.

This is not a market failure. It is the result of deliberate strategy: bundling, format control,
and platform leverage, deployed systematically over four decades. The office suite market
was competitive in 1990 (Lotus, WordPerfect, Corel, Borland). By 2000, it was a monopoly.
The browser market was competitive in 2005. By 2020, Chrome held 66% share. Monopoly
kills innovation and harms consumers.

Why Now: What Has Changed
Three technological shifts create an unprecedented window of opportunity:

   1.â The Collaborative Revolution: Users expect real-time collaboration (Google Docs
       proved it). But Microsoft Office's architectureâdesigned for single users in the
       1980sâcannot be retrofitted cleanly. Building from scratch with CRDTs (Conflict-free
       Replicated Data Types) enables architecturally superior, offline-first collaboration
       without centralized servers.
   2.â The Rust Revolution: C and C++ were designed for single-core processors. Rust
       enables memory-safe, concurrent, energy-efficient software for modern multi-core
       and network-oriented hardware. Small teams can now build systems software that
       previously required thousands of engineers.
   3.â The AI Revolution: AI transforms software development in three ways: (1)
       Productivity multiplierâdevelopers report 2-10x productivity gains with LLM
       assistance; (2) New ways of workingâAI enables fast feedback loops; (3) AI
       everywhere requires new architectureâdocuments designed for collaboration are
       also better suited for AI processing.

Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns tells us that technological progress is exponential,
not linear. We can compress timelines that seem impossible.

Add to this the political momentum: Trump administration attacks on EU digital regulation,
visa sanctions on European tech policy architects, the ICC switching from Microsoft to

OpenDesk after being locked out of Outlook. Europe has both the motivation and the
institutional frameworks (DC-EDIC, Sovereign Tech Fund) to act.

The Proposal
Building a European Digital Commons Foundation :

   â¢â   â¬50 million per year from the European Commission for six years (~â¬300 million
        total)
   â¢â   Additional private sector contributions, with the goal of digital commons becoming
        self-sustaining
   â¢â   400 developers building foundational components in Rust
   â¢â   Governance by proven technical leaders: Jean-Baptiste Kempf (VLC creator), Luc
        Julia (Siri co-creator), Benjamin Andre (Cozy Cloud founder), Quentin Adam (Clever
        Cloud CEO)
   â¢â   Components, not products: document engines, browser engines, collaboration
        protocols via the OpenBuro specification
   â¢â   Asset companies, not flux companies: enable European software vendors to build
        sustainable businesses on top of shared infrastructure

European companies and governments build products on top; competition happens at the
product layer. This reopens markets through shared infrastructureâdigital commonsârather
than replacing one monopoly with another.

The Global Picture: American Digital Hegemony
The GAFAM Empire: Scale Beyond Comprehension

The GAFAM companies (Google, Apple, Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Microsoft) plus Tesla
represent a concentration of economic power unprecedented in human history:

   â¢â   Combined market capitalization exceeds $12 trillion (2025)
   â¢â   This is larger than the GDP of every European country except Germany
   â¢â   US firms hold 73% of global tech market capitalization ($31.1 trillion)
   â¢â   The United States and China together account for 90% of the market capitalization
        of the world's 70 largest digital platforms
   â¢â   France represents approximately 0.4% of this market

The European Digital Bill: â¬264 Billion Annually
The Asteres report quantifies Europe's digital dependency with precision:

 Metric                                          Value
 Annual European spending on US                  â¬264 billion
 cloud/software
 As percentage of EU GDP                         1.5%

                                      European Open Digital Ecosystems - Response to Call for Evidence

 Comparison: EU energy import bill                â¬360 billion
 Comparison: Total EU budget                      â¬170 billion (1.5x less)
 Share of EU large enterprise cloud/software      83%
 going to US
 Value added created in the United States         80%
 US jobs supported by this spending               ~2 million

If the European Union was able to produce just 15% of the cloud/software services it
currently purchases from the United States by 2035, this would result in 463,000 additional
jobs in the European Union.

This Document's Focus: Microsoft and Google
Microsoft controls:
   â¢â   Office suites (Word, Excel, PowerPoint): near-total enterprise dominance
   â¢â   Operating systems (Windows): 72% desktop market share
   â¢â   Cloud infrastructure (Azure): second-largest cloud provider, bundled with Office 365

Google controls:
   â¢â   Web browsers (Chrome): 66% market share
   â¢â   Web standards (WHATWG): de facto control of HTML specification
   â¢â   Advertising (Google Ads): $238 billion annual revenue
   â¢â   Search: 92% market share

These are the monopolies that open-source alternatives can realistically challenge. The
technical path is clear. The work is already underway.

Microsoft Before Windows: An Applications Company
The common perception is that Microsoft's dominance came from Windows. This is
backwards. Microsoft was first and foremost an Office suite companyâand Office drove
Windows, not the other way around.

Here's a fact most people forget: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Office were all Mac
applications before Windows even existed as a viable platform.

   â¢â   Word 1.0 for Macintosh: 1984 (the Mac's first year)
   â¢â   Excel 1.0 for Macintosh: 1985
   â¢â   PowerPoint 1.0 for Macintosh: 1987 (acquired from Forethought)
   â¢â   Microsoft Office for Mac: 1989
   â¢â   Microsoft Office for Windows: October 1990 (over a year later)

Office as Strategic Weapon
In 1985, Apple considered legal action against Microsoft for copying Mac interface elements
in Windows. Gates's response was a threat: if Apple sued, Microsoft would immediately stop
developing Word and Excel for Mac.

Apple depended on Microsoft applications. CEO John Sculley backed down and licensed
Mac technologies to Microsoft. The pattern was established: Office was the weapon. The
platform was secondary.

The Open Market of the 1990s: What Competition Looked Like
Before the monopoly, there was a competitive market. And competition produced
innovation.

In the early 1990s, multiple office suites competed vigorously:
   â¢â   Lotus 1-2-3: The spreadsheet king, so successful it was called the PC's "killer app"
   â¢â   WordPerfect: The dominant word processor, beloved by legal professionals
   â¢â   Corel: Acquired WordPerfect in 1996, continued competing
   â¢â   Borland: Quattro Pro spreadsheet, Paradox database

Microsoft's    bundling strategyâfirst with Windows,    then through enterprise
agreementsâsystematically eliminated these competitors. By 2000, the market was
effectively a monopoly.

Office as Weapon: Killing the Linux Desktop
Linux runs 96%+ of cloud servers. Linux powers Android. Linux is technically superior for
many use cases. Yet Linux never captured the desktop market. Why? Office compatibility.

The compatibility gap is not accidental. Microsoft uses its proprietary Office format (OOXML)
as a barrier. Every compatibility failure reinforces the message: "You need real Microsoft
Office." The desktop Linux revolution that seemed imminent in 2005-2010 was strangled by
format lock-in.

Office 365 and the Azure Lock-In: A Contractual Problem
Today, Office extends Microsoft's reach into cloud computing through contractual bundling:

   â¢â   Office 365 stores documents in OneDrive and SharePoint (which run on Azure)
   â¢â   Enterprise Agreements bundle Office 365 with Azure credits at artificially low prices
   â¢â   Licensing terms make it expensive to run Microsoft software on competing clouds

The mechanism is contractual, not technical. Microsoft manipulates Office 365 license
pricing to make Azure artificially attractive. This bundling is now under FTC investigation and
European Commission scrutiny.

The Browser Story: From Microsoft to Google
The First Browser War
In the 1990s, Netscape Navigator pioneered the web browser. Microsoft responded by
bundling Internet Explorer with Windows and giving it away free. This "cut off Netscape's air
supply" (Microsoft internal memo). By 2002, IE had 95% market share. Netscape was
destroyed.

Google's Capture of Web Standards
Chrome launched in 2008. By 2025, it holds approximately 66% market share globally. But
Chrome's deepest power comes from Google's control of web standards themselves. In
2019, the W3C ceded HTML standardization to WHATWG, which is controlled by browser
vendors. Google's dominance means Google effectively controls what HTML means.

The Lesson: Standards Are Not Enough Without Implementations

                                    Page 8 | Clever Cloud SAS
                                      European Open Digital Ecosystems - Response to Call for Evidence

Open standards are necessary but not sufficient. If you don't control the
implementations, you cannot control the integrationsâand you cannot ensure
interoperability.

When it comes to the EU, to achieve digital sovereignty, we need more than open standards.
We need reference implementations owned by the commonsâimplementations that
define what compliance looks like, that other products can build upon, and that no single
vendor can unilaterally change.

Why Migrations Fail Today

The Document Compatibility Problem
Large organizations have tens of thousands of document tools: contracts, reports,
templates, forms, presentations, spreadsheets with embedded data. Each document
represents accumulated work, institutional knowledge, and established processes.

Migration fails because:
   4.â Imperfect rendering: Even small formatting differences in contracts are
       unacceptable
   5.â Broken functionality: Excel macros, Word mail merge templates, PowerPoint
       animations
   6.â Accumulated complexity: Years of documents with embedded objects
   7.â Verification burden: Who will review 50,000 documents to confirm they converted
       correctly?

Format Complexity: The OOXML Problem
The Document Foundation's 2025 analysis documents how OOXML was deliberately
designed to be hard to implement. The OOXML specification totals over 8,000
pagesâdeliberately verbose to discourage alternative implementations.

 Documentation                   Concise, usable                   8,000+ pages, incomplete

Why Collaboration Requires CRDTs
Microsoft has spent over a decade trying to add real-time collaboration to Office. It remains
inferior to Google Docs. Why?

OOXML was designed for saving and loading complete documents, not for tracking granular
changes from multiple simultaneous editors. Modern collaboration requires CRDTs
(Conflict-free Replicated Data Types). A document engine built from the ground up with

                                    Page 9 | Clever Cloud SAS
                                      European Open Digital Ecosystems - Response to Call for Evidence

CRDTs can provide true offline-first collaboration, decentralized sync, and mathematically
guaranteed consistency.

Microsoft cannot retrofit CRDTs onto Office without fundamentally redesigning the file
format.

What Has Changed: The Window of Opportunity
The Collaborative Revolution: Microsoft's Weakness Is Our
Opportunity
Google Docs proved users expect real-time collaboration. Microsoft has spent over a decade
trying to retrofit collaboration onto Office. They have failed. This is a massive opportunity for
European open source solutions.

A new document engine, built from scratch for collaboration, can leapfrog both Google
(centralized, requires their servers) and Microsoft (retrofitted, architecturally broken). Open
source can deliver collaboration that neither Google nor Microsoft can match.

The Rust Revolution
C and C++ were designed in a different era. Today's reality is radically different: multi-core
processors, networked everything, energy constraints.

Rust's innovation: the ownership system and borrow checker enforce memory safety and
thread safety at compile time. Microsoft has noted that 70% of their security vulnerabilities
were due to memory safety issuesâRust eliminates this entire category.

Rust has achieved remarkable adoption:
   â¢â   Linux kernel: Rust is now accepted for kernel development
   â¢â   Android: Google is writing new Android components in Rust
   â¢â   Windows: Microsoft is exploring Rust for Windows kernel
   â¢â   AWS, Cloudflare, Discord, Dropbox: Production Rust at scale

Rust Opens New Hardware Architectures
Software written in C/C++ often carries hidden assumptions about x86 architecture.
Rewriting in Rust forces clean abstractions that work across processor architectures. This
enables ARM and RISC-V, breaking dependencies on Intel/AMD (American) and reducing
lock-in to Apple's proprietary ARM implementations.

Servo: Browser Components Become Office Components
The key insight: browser rendering components and office document rendering
components are fundamentally similar. A web browser parses markup, builds a layout
tree, renders text and graphics. A document editor does the same.

Mozilla originally developed Servo as a showcase for Rust. After Mozilla's 2020 layoffs, the
project was revived by Igalia, a Spanish open-source consultancy based in A Coruna. Igalia
is the #1 contributor to Servo, and a worker-owned cooperative founded in 2001.

IronCalc is a German open-source project building a spreadsheet engine in Rust from the
ground up. This is exactly the component-level approach this proposal advocates.

The AI Revolution: Three Dimensions of Change

                                      European Open Digital Ecosystems - Response to Call for Evidence

AI transforms software development and document handling in three distinct ways:
   8.â AI as Productivity Multiplier: LLM-assisted development multiplies programmer
       productivity drastically. A team of 400 skilled developers can accomplish what
       previously required thousands.
   9.â AI as a New Way of Working: Users can describe what they want in natural
       language, get immediate results, and iterate rapidly.
   10.âAI Everywhere Requires New Architecture: Documents designed for collaboration
       are also better suited for AI processing. Microsoft's architecture actively hinders AI
       integration.

Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns
Ray Kurzweil's Law tells us: "The paradigm shift rate is currently doubling approximately
every decade. So, the technological progress in the twenty-first century will be equivalent to
what would be required at the level of 200 centuries." Timelines that seemed impossible
compress dramatically.

The Political Momentum
The geopolitical context shifted drastically in 2025-2026 :
   â¢â   Trump administration threatened tariffs on countries with digital regulations
   â¢â   Visa sanctions imposed on European digital policy architects
   â¢â   EU Parliament adopted a technological sovereignty report calling to "drastically
        reduce European dependence on US technologies"
   â¢â   The International Criminal Court replaced Microsoft Office with OpenDesk after being
        locked out of Outlook
   â¢â   July 2025: Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands established DC-EDIC for
        Digital Commons

DMA Browser Choice Screen Success
The Digital Markets Act's browser choice screens has already shown effectiveness : :
   â¢â   Firefox daily active users in Germany increased by 99%
   â¢â   Firefox daily active users on iOS in France grew by 111%
   â¢â   Brave saw iOS downloads jump +46%
   â¢â   Opera reported 164% increase in new iOS users

When users are given genuine choice, they choose alternatives. The barrier was never
preferenceâit was default bundling.

Markets to Reopen
This is not just about market share or economic sovereignty. It's about saving the future of
computing and making it human-centered again.

Reopening these markets is about building a humanist digital future: an Internet that
serves people's interests rather than extracting from them, computing that respects privacy
by design, AI that enhances human capability without concentrating power.

Office Suites: Breaking the Keystone

                                    Page 11 | Clever Cloud SAS
                                     European Open Digital Ecosystems - Response to Call for Evidence

Microsoft Office is the keystone of the entire Microsoft monopoly: Office locks users to
Windows, Office data flows to Azure, Enterprise Agreements bundle everything together.
Breaking Office could break the entire lock-in chain.

The path forward: build a new document rendering engine in Rust, designed from the ground
up for:
   11.âPerfect format compatibility: Pixel-perfect rendering of legacy Office documents
   12.âNative collaboration: Real-time editing with CRDTs as foundational architecture
   13.âAI integration: Document structure accessible to language models
   14.âCross-platform: Web, desktop, and mobile from single codebase
   15.âEmbeddable: Components usable in any application

Web Browsers: Unlocking the Advertising Market
Chromeâs 66% market share significantly reinforces Googleâs dominance in digital
advertising. Hence, breaking browser monopoly partially reopens the advertising
marketâcurrently $349 billion annually in Google's hands.

Servo is the only independent browser engine with active development outside Google
(Chromium) and Apple (WebKit). A well-funded Servo could power multiple browser
products, breaking the Chrome/Safari duopoly.

Operating Systems: The Long Game That Reopens Hardware
The netbook episode (2007-2012) demonstrates that operating system choice enables
hardware competition. When Linux was viable on netbooks, new hardware form factors
emerged, new manufacturers entered the market, prices dropped dramatically. Microsoft's
defensive action killed not just Linux adoption but hardware innovation.

Reopening the OS market would reopen the hardware market. European hardware
manufacturers could compete without the Windows tax.

The Proposal: A European Digital Commons
Foundation
Mission and Philosophy
Digital commons are shared digital resourcesâsoftware, standards, protocolsâowned and
governed collectively by communities rather than single entities. Digital commons always win
in the long runâLinux on servers is proof. The question is whether we accelerate that
timeline through strategic investment.

The foundation builds document rendering engines, browser engines, core libraries,
protocols, and standards. It does not build branded office suites, browsers, or operating
systems. Private companies and governments build products using the foundation's
components. Competition happens at the product layer, on a level playing field.

The OpenBuro Initiative
A critical gap exists: alternative applications have reached unprecedented maturity, but they
remain isolated silos. The OpenBuro specification, developed through collaboration
between La Suite de la DINUM (France) and Twake.ai, addresses this gap.

                                  Page 12 | Clever Cloud SAS

 Component                                      Functionality
 Authentication                                 Versatile SSO, user management, profiles,
                                                groups
 Navigation                                     Home, navigation bar, application grid,
                                                global search
 Platform Sharing                               Users, groups, roles, cross-service
                                                workspaces
 Inter-App & AI                                 Capability & Intent Casting, API
                                                standardization for RAGs
 Security                                       E2E encryption managed at platform level
 Mobile & Desktop                               Common authentication, discovery,
                                                notification management

The foundation must build low-level componentsâthe LiveKits, the document engines, the
browser enginesânot just applications on top of American components.

Use-case examples
This approach has already been proven in practice:

MakAir Project (2020): During the COVID-19 crisis, Quentin Adam initiated and led the
MakAir open-source ventilator project. In just four weeks, using open-source
methodologies, ~300 volunteers designed, certified, and industrialized an artificial
respiratorâfrom concept to production-ready medical device. The project was backed by the
French military (Agence de l'innovation de defense) and major industrial partners
(STMicroelectronics, Michelin, Parrot). This is proof that open-source coordination can
achieve in weeks what traditional processes take years to accomplish.

The expertise exists. We have proven we can mobilize large teams for complex engineering.
The question is whether Europe will fund it at scale.

Including Developers and technical leaders in the Governance
structure
The foundation is governed by proven technical leaders, not administrators or business
representatives. This is a purely technical body. This is NGI's model fixed: instead of
funding application projects and hoping for coherence, the foundation directly employs
developers working toward a unified technical vision.

Proposed Technical Council (suggestions to be validated):
Jean-Baptiste Kempf (France) â President of VideoLAN, lead VLC developer since 2005.
Built one of the most successful open-source media players in history. The proof that
European developers can build globally dominant software.
Igalia Leadership (Spain) â Worker-owned cooperative that revived Servo. The #1
contributor to Servo. They know how browsers work at the deepest level.
Luc Julia (France) â Co-creator of Apple Siri. Advocate for European AI sovereignty.
Benjamin Andre (France) â Founder of Cozy Cloud. Leading Linagora's Twake workplace
initiative.

Quentin Adam (France) â CEO of Clever Cloud. Initiator and leader of MakAir: designed,
certified, and industrialized an open-source ventilator with 300 people in 4 weeks using
open-source methodologies. Has already demonstrated the ability to coordinate
large-scale open-source engineering at speed.

Digital Commons, Not Products
The foundation produces shared infrastructureâdigital commonsânot branded products:
Document Commons: Rust-based document rendering engine, perfect OOXML/ODF
parser, CRDT-native collaboration protocol, AI-ready APIs, IronCalc integration
Browser Commons: Servo browser engine (continued development), web standards
implementation, security hardening
Platform Commons (OpenBuro): Service orchestration                   standard,    authentication,
cross-application communication, AI API standardization
Infrastructure Commons: Cross-platform build systems, testing suites, documentation,
specifications, reference implementations

Asset Companies, Not Flux Companies
Most European open source companies rely on service-based models. These are "flux
companies"âtheir revenue depends on continuous labor. European actors generate
upstream value while downstream economic value is captured by American cloud providers.

The foundation enables a different model: asset companies that build products on top of
shared commons. When foundational components are provided as digital commons,
markets reopen, European companies can compete in spaces currently monopolized.

This is not just about business modelsâit's about changing the future of computing.
Asset companies built on European digital commons can offer genuine EU alternatives to
American monopolies.

Funding Model
The core proposal: â¬50 million annually from the European Commission for six years
(~â¬300 million total).

For context:
   â¢â   Microsoft Office revenue exceeds $50 billion annually
   â¢â   European public procurement of software: ~â¬35 billion annually
   â¢â   LiveKit alone raised $183 million from Silicon Valley VCs
   â¢â   The proposed investment is a tiny fraction of what Europe already spends

100% of Funding Goes to Developers
This must be crystal clear: the entirety of the funding goes to employing developers. Not
administrators. Not consultants. Not studies. Developers who write code and ship software.

The foundation's purpose is singular: shipping code. Every euro invested translates directly
into lines of code, merged pull requests, and working software. This is how digital commons
get built.

Why Direct Employment, Not Grants

                                  Page 14 | Clever Cloud SAS
                                      European Open Digital Ecosystems - Response to Call for Evidence

Unlike grant programs, the foundation directly employs developers:
   â¢â   Unified technical direction
   â¢â   Long-term continuity
   â¢â   Accountability for results
   â¢â   Ability to recruit top talent with competitive compensation
   â¢â   All money becomes code

Implementation Timeline
The detailed implementation timeline is actively being developed. This is a discussion
to be had with the Commission and stakeholders once there is a signal to proceed.

Current key findings :
   â¢â   The timelines will assume accelerated progress per Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating
        Returns
   â¢â   What would have taken 10 years in the 2000s can be achieved in 3-4 years with
        modern tools, AI assistance, and Rust productivity
   â¢â   The technical council composition, hiring roadmap, and development milestones will
        be formalized through the foundation establishment process

Conclusion
The market structures that shaped American digital hegemony were not inevitableâthey
were built through deliberate strategy, starting with a single contract clause in 1980 and
reinforced through decades of bundling, format control, and network effects.

The technical and political conditions now exist to reopen these markets through digital
commonsâshared infrastructure collectively owned and governed, enabling competition at
the product layer while keeping foundational technology open.

Rust enables small teams to build reliable systems software. CRDTs solve collaboration
problems Microsoft cannot. AI multiplies developer productivity and transforms how people
work with documents. Kurzweil's Law tells us timelines compress exponentially. And Europe
has both the political will and the institutional frameworks (DC-EDIC, Sovereign Tech Fund)
to act.

Let's talk about scale. Europe spends â¬264 billion annually on American cloud and
software services. The total EU budget is â¬170 billion. We are asking for â¬50 million per
yearâless than 0.02% of what we already send to American tech companies every year.
This is not a significant investment. It is a rounding error compared to our current
dependency. And yet this modest sum, directed entirely to employing developers who ship
code, can build the foundational components that reopen markets currently monopolized.

The proposal is concrete: fund a European Digital Commons Foundation with â¬50 million
per year from the Commission for six years. 400 developers, governed by proven technical
leaders, building shared infrastructure via the OpenBuro specification that enables market
competition. Every euro becomes code. Private sector funding will complement public
investment, with the goal of digital commons becoming self-sustaining.

We cannot build European sovereignty by sprinkling French interfaces on American
infrastructure. We need the low-level componentsâthe document engines, the browser
engines, the collaboration protocols. This requires hundreds of developers working on
foundational software, not just applications.

The window is open. The question is whether Europe will walk through it. As a matter
of fact, we are ready and committed to move forward as soon as the Commission
provides the signal.
