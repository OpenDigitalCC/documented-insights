        From Open Components to Governable Digital
                     Ecosystems
                                      Executive Summary

Submission to: European Commission â Call for Evidence on European Open Digital
Ecosystems (Q1 2026)

Context and Problem Statement
European policy discourse increasingly recognises open source, open standards, and
interoperability as strategic pillars for digital sovereignty, competitiveness, and cybersecurity.
However, current policy and funding approaches exhibit a structural gap: while openness is
promoted at the component and project level, insufficient attention is paid to the architectural
layer required to make open systems governable, auditable, and operable at institutional
scaleâparticularly in regulated public sectors such as healthcare, cloud infrastructure, and
critical digital services.

As a result, Europe continues to produce high-quality open components while remaining
dependent on externally governed platforms that provide the missing integration of identity,
policy enforcement, execution control, and auditability. This creates a contradiction between
stated sovereignty objectives and actual deployment realities.

Key Evidence and Observations
â¢ Open source alone does not prevent lock-in; governance, identity, and policy layers determine
real autonomy.
â¢ Current funding models disproportionately favour large consortia, excluding solo developers
and microâ SMEs who maintain foundational infrastructure.
â¢ The discontinuation of cascade funding mechanisms (e.g. NGI) has reduced support for
precisely the actors most critical to ecosystem resilience.
â¢ Regulated domains require explicit accountability, escalation paths, and evidence
continuityâfeatures rarely specified in open digital initiatives.

Architectural Insight
The core challenge is not a lack of innovation or talent, but the absence of shared architectural
contracts that translate openness into operational capability. Successful platforms dominate not
because of superior infrastructure, but because they provide integrated governance: unified
identity, enforceable policy, deterministic execution boundaries, and verifiable audit trails.
Without an equivalent open and Europeanâ governed substrate, digital sovereignty remains
aspirational.

Implications for EU Policy
To achieve the objectives of the European Open Digital Ecosystems Strategy, policy
instruments must evolve from supporting isolated projects to enabling shared architectural
foundations. This includes funding and recognition for architectural definition work, sustained
support for independent maintainers, and explicit linkage between openness and governance
requirements in regulated sectors.

Investing in this missing layer would unlock existing open source capacity, reduce systemic
dependency on externally governed platforms, and allow European institutions to deploy open
technologies with confidence, accountability, and public trust.
