Ouvertarism as a Strategic Framework for European Open
Digital Ecosystems
Europeâs technological catch-up will not be achieved by incremental policy adjustments or by
attempting to replicate dominant foreign models. It requires a coherent doctrine, explicitly
grounded in Europeâs scientific, industrial, and humanist traditions. Ouvertarism, as developed
in Ouvertarisme â Le NumÃ©rique des LumiÃ¨res (November 2025 ISBN 9782322664078 â in
French, soon in English and German), proposes such a doctrine.

Ouvertarism is not an ideology of openness, but a strategic method: the deliberate use of
openness to transform structural weakness into leverage. Drawing from the Renaissance and the
Enlightenment, it reasserts that scientific transparency, shared knowledge, and interoperable
infrastructures are not cultural preferences, but the historical sources of Europeâs competitive
advantage. In the digital age, this translates into a systematic approach to open digital ecosystems
as foundations of sovereignty, resilience, and innovation.

Europeâs Structural Risk: From Digital Dependency to Cognitive
Dependency

Europe is no longer merely dependent on foreign digital infrastructure. It is becoming
structurally dependent on externalised knowledge systems.

Cloud platforms, AI models, developer tools, data infrastructures, and now generative AI
services increasingly operate as vertically integrated stacks controlled outside the EU. These
systems do not only host European data and workloads; they mediate access to knowledge,
expertise, and decision-making itself. The emerging model is not software-as-a-service, but
knowledge-as-a-service.

In this configuration, European companies, administrations, researchers, and even governments
progressively lose:

   â¢   the ability to inspect and understand the tools they rely on,
   â¢   the capacity to adapt or repurpose them independently,
   â¢   and ultimately the competence to produce and transmit knowledge autonomously.

This is not a temporary market imbalance. It is a systemic risk affecting industrial autonomy,
democratic resilience, and Europeâs ability to shape its own future.
The Seven Pillars of an Ouvertarist Strategy

To counter this trajectory, Ouvertarism articulates seven complementary pillars. Each addresses
a specific layer of the digital stack; together, they form a coherent ecosystem.

Open Science

       Reproducibility, transparency, and collective audit as foundations of trust, acceleration,
       and cumulative innovation. This is an obvious pillar, but one that is critical in computer
       science given compounding effects.

Open Source

       Shared, inspectable, and evolutive software infrastructures that mutualise costs, improve
       security, and prevent dependency on single vendors. It is an important if not foundational
       pillar in the digital realm, but also clearly in the ouvertariste doctrine â yet it is not alone.

Open Data

       Treating data as a strategic common, enabling innovation while preventing value capture
       by dominant platforms.

Open Weights

       Access to pre-trained AI model weights as a condition for democratic and industrial
       control of artificial intelligence. In fact, one could argue that most models are trained on
       data that was massively taken from the human collective, without permission. There is a
       case to be made to restore ownership and require that models belong to the collective.

Open Platforms

       Interoperable European data spaces and service layers that enable competition,
       composability, and sovereignty by design. It accelerates adoption.

Open Hardware

       Mastery of critical hardware layers, from architectures to accelerators, to reduce supply
       chain and geopolitical dependency. One of the most underrated pillars, but one with the
       most enduring benefits over time.
Open Standards

       The connective tissue of the ecosystem, ensuring interoperability, substitutability, and
       long-term freedom of choice. This is how the world wide web emerged and terminated
       proprietary portals.

These pillars are mutually reinforcing. Open standards enable open platforms; open platforms
amplify open data and open models; open source and open hardware anchor the entire system in
inspectable, governable foundations.

From Fragmented Practices to a Strategic Programme

Europe already invests in many of these areas. What is missing is not activity, but coordination,
prioritisation, and doctrine.

An Ouvertarist strategy implies:

   â¢   moving from project-based support to lifecycle thinking (development, maintenance,
       deployment, governance),
   â¢   aligning public procurement, funding instruments, and regulation around open
       foundations,
   â¢   and recognising digital commons as strategic infrastructure, not peripheral innovation
       artefacts.

Operationally, this translates into measures such as âopen-firstâ procurement principles,
sustained funding for critical open infrastructures, pan-European OSPO networks extended
beyond software alone, and systematic education of engineers, executives, and policymakers in
open industrial strategies.

Ouvertarism in Practice: How Challengers Use Openness to Counter
Dominance

Ouvertarism is not theoretical. History repeatedly shows that openness is the most effective
strategy available to challengers facing structurally dominant incumbents. When scale,
capital, and network effects favour the incumbent, openness becomes the only viable lever to
rebalance competition.

Several emblematic cases illustrate this dynamic.

Linux vs. proprietary operating systems

Linux emerged as an open, inspectable, and collectively governed operating system at a time
when proprietary platforms dominated computing. Its openness allowed a global ecosystem of
contributors, vendors, and integrators to share costs, accelerate innovation, and avoid vendor
lock-in. Today, Linux underpins the vast majority of servers, cloud infrastructure, embedded
systems, and supercomputers worldwide. The challenger won not by outspending incumbents,
but by creating a shared foundation no single actor could capture.

Open standards vs. proprietary formats and protocols (the Web, TCP/IP,
HTML)

The global internet itself is a canonical ouvertarist victory. Open standards such as TCP/IP,
HTTP, and HTML prevented any single actor from monopolising communication, content
distribution, or application delivery. By contrast, proprietary standards historically created
captive markets and rent extraction. The success of the Web demonstrates a core ouvertarist
principle: when standards are open, competition shifts to services and innovation, not
control of interfaces. Europe benefited enormously from this openness, yet today risks
forgetting that its digital prosperity was built on precisely this model.

Kubernetes vs. vertically integrated cloud platforms

Kubernetes did not defeat cloud hyperscalers; it constrained them. By establishing an open,
portable, and interoperable orchestration layer, Kubernetes rebalanced power between cloud
providers and users. It enabled workload portability, fostered a competitive ecosystem of
services, and prevented infrastructure abstraction from becoming a proprietary choke point. Once
again, openness transformed a potential lock-in layer into a shared standard.

Chinaâs open digital strategy vs. US platform dominance

At a geopolitical scale, China has systematically used openness selectively and strategically,
particularly in standards, open-source software, and hardware architectures, to reduce
dependency on US-controlled technologies. While its model differs fundamentally from the
European one in governance and values, the lesson is structural: openness can be wielded as an
instrument of strategic autonomy, even by actors initially at a disadvantage.

Open hardware (RISC-V) vs. proprietary instruction sets

RISC-V illustrates how openness can rebalance power even at the deepest hardware layer. By
providing an open, royalty-free instruction set architecture, RISC-V lowers barriers to entry for
chip designers, enables local innovation, and reduces long-term dependency on proprietary
architectures. For challengers, open hardware restores strategic optionality and supply-chain
resilience. It mirrors the Linux dynamic at the silicon level: shared foundations, competitive
implementations.

Open science vs. proprietary advantage: âAttention Is All You Needâ
In 2017, Google researchers published the paper âAttention Is All You Needâ, openly describing
the Transformer architecture. This act of open science triggered one of the fastest and most
consequential technological diffusions in history. Within a few years, the architecture became the
foundation of modern AI, powering large language models, multimodal systems, and generative
applications worldwide.

Crucially, this openness did not merely benefit Google. It enabled a global, decentralised
innovation wave: universities, startups, open-source communities, and competing firms rapidly
adopted, extended, and industrialised the idea. Entire ecosystems emerged around Transformers,
often outside Googleâs direct control. In doing so, open publication eroded Googleâs exclusive
advantage, lowered entry barriers, and reshaped the competitive landscape of AI itself.

This example illustrates a central ouvertarist insight: openness can simultaneously accelerate a
technological paradigm and undermine the dominance of its original inventor. By choosing
transparency over secrecy, Google catalysed collective progress, but also accepted that value
creation would shift from proprietary control of knowledge to ecosystem-level competition on
implementation, scale, and use cases.

For Europe, the lesson is decisive. Open science is not a naÃ¯ve academic ideal. It is a strategic
force multiplier. When coupled with open source, open weights, and open standards, it enables
challengers to stand on equal conceptual footing with incumbents and to compete where it truly
matters: execution, trust, and societal alignment.

Open AI models vs. closed foundation models

The emergence of open-weight AI models, such as Metaâs LLaMA 2, demonstrated that closed,
API-only models are not the inevitable end state of AI. By releasing model weights, challengers
enabled an explosion of downstream innovation, local deployment, fine-tuning, and independent
evaluation. This reintroduced contestability into a field otherwise at risk of rapid monopolisation.
Open models do not eliminate competition; they restore it.

Across these examples, the pattern is consistent:

Openness allows challengers to:

   â¢   amortise development costs across ecosystems,
   â¢   attract diverse contributors and innovators,
   â¢   regain bargaining power vis-Ã -vis dominant players,
   â¢   and shift competition from control of infrastructure to quality of services and
       applications.

Ouvertarism generalises this logic across the entire digital stack.
Policy Implications for the European Commission

If the European Union chooses to embrace Ouvertarism as a strategic framework, several
concrete policy implications follow. These do not require new ideological commitments, but a
re-prioritisation and alignment of existing instruments.

1. Treat open digital foundations as strategic infrastructure

Open source software, open standards, open data spaces, and open AI models should be
recognised as critical infrastructure, on par with physical networks. This implies long-term
funding for maintenance, security, and governance, not only for initial innovation.

2. Shift from project logic to lifecycle logic

EU programmes often fund creation but neglect sustainability. Ouvertarism requires support
across the full lifecycle: development, deployment, maintenance, and evolution. Without this,
Europe will continue to create assets whose value is later captured elsewhere.

3. Align public procurement with openness objectives

Public administrations are powerful market shapers. Procurement policies should systematically
favour solutions built on open foundations, with transparent and justified exceptions. This creates
domestic demand, reduces lock-in, and accelerates ecosystem maturity.

4. Extend the scope of openness beyond software

Current policies focus primarily on open source. Ouvertarism calls for a broader scope
encompassing data, AI models, platforms, hardware, and standards. Treating these dimensions
separately weakens their combined impact.

5. Invest in governance, not only technology

Open ecosystems fail without clear governance. The Commission can play a catalytic role by
supporting neutral foundations, European-led governance structures, and shared rules that ensure
openness remains a public good rather than a capture vector.

6. Measure what matters

Finally, openness must be measurable. Indicators of dependency, substitutability, portability, and
contribution to digital commons should inform policy evaluation, funding decisions, and
strategic adjustments.
These implications are fully aligned with the objectives of technological sovereignty,
competitiveness, cybersecurity, and resilience articulated in the Call for Evidence. Ouvertarism
provides the missing connective tissue between them.

The Cost of Inaction: The Knowledge-as-a-Service Civilizational Death
Trap

Failing to act decisively will lock Europe into a position where it no longer controls the
production, transmission, or evolution of knowledge itself.

In a knowledge-as-a-service model, Europe risks becoming:

   â¢   a consumer of opaque cognitive systems it cannot audit,
   â¢   a renter of innovation rather than its producer,
   â¢   and ultimately a follower in domains where it once set the standards.

This is not only an economic risk. It is a civilisational one. A society that no longer understands
or governs its technical systems cannot fully exercise democratic choice, nor sustain a pluralistic
and humanist model of progress.

Ouvertarism offers a way out. Not by retreating behind protectionism, nor by competing on scale
alone, but by turning openness into Europeâs strategic differentiator. It is a call to assume a
challenger position consciously, to transform digital commons into instruments of power, and to
ensure that Europe remains a place where knowledge is produced, shared, and governed in the
public interest.

This Call for Evidence is a unique opportunity to elevate openness from a collection of best
practices to a deliberate European strategy.
