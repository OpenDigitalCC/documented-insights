Associazione Italiana Internet Provider (AIIP) is the oldest and largest association of ICT
operators in Italy and has been representing for 30 years more than 60 Italian SME operators,
who have been and still are committed to create an open, distributed, and independent telecom
network, including by setting up colocation data centres and offering and/or using them to
provide housing, hosting, and cloud and edge services.

AIIP welcomes the opportunity to submit its contribution to the European Open Digital
Ecosystems initiative. Open-source and sovereign data management represent two
fundamental pillars for building a more open, efficient, and independent Internet, enabling
innovation, trust, and resilience across digital services and infrastructures. By promoting open
digital infrastructure and reducing reliance on non-EU proprietary technologies, this initiative
can help secure a more sovereign, secure, and sustainable digital future for citizens, businesses
and public administrations alike.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are the main
barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open
source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

First of all, it is doubtful and misleading that the âmaintenance of high-quality and secure open
sourceâ is hampered in Europe. Europe is plenty of very important and widely used open-source
projects. This ecosystem has not to be hampered with Regulations and Directives if we really
want it to grow more. What is really hampering the sector is its âadoptionâ, especially in (public)
tenders, with the wrong idea that an open-source solution could be not reliable or could lack
support.

This is a real issue, since the open-source sector in the European Union has a particularly high
strategic potential because it combines two dimensions that are inseparable today: technology
and the continent's ability to govern it. The first strength of the EU is the widespread availability
of expertise, fuelled by universities, research centres, specialised companies and public
administrations which, in many contexts, have already developed a concrete awareness of
interoperability, open standards, data protection and reliability. In this context, open-source is
not only a licensing model or a way of distributing software, but a practical knowledge transfer
mechanism.

Open-source communities are a social infrastructure for continuous learning: they make the
âhowâ of technical choices transparent, allow peer review and create systematic training
opportunities on the ground. In a now strategic IT sector, this dynamic is decisive, because it
reduces dependence on external expertise and strengthens the continent's ability to develop,
maintain and control its systems over time.

At the same time, the EU suffers from weaknesses that prevent turning this potential into a fully
measurable competitive advantage. The most obvious is fragmentation: initiatives and
investments often arise in an uncoordinated manner between Member States, with short and
discontinuous funding cycles, while safety and reliability require constant maintenance and
industrial processes. This leads to a paradox: Europe makes extensive use of open-source
software, but does not always invest adequately in the sustainability of communities and in the
essential, often invisible, work that ensures quality, testing, documentation, release
management and vulnerability response. This distance between consumption and contribution
is not only an ethical or community problem; it is a strategic vulnerability, because it increases
the likelihood that crucial components are maintained by very few people, with insufficient
resources and with de facto ungoverned dependencies.

Anyway, there is no evidence that funding programs could fuel the development of new and
better open-source projects. Some very important tools are often single-man projects and the
authors should only have an ecosystem which allows them to sell their products or sell their
support services, alongside system integrators.

A further, critical dimension of European digital vulnerabilities lies in its broader technological
dependence from non-European providers. A recent study 1 shows that about 80 % of total
European spending on cloud software and services goes to U.S. companies, representing around
â¬265 billion annually, and this pattern supports roughly 2 million jobs outside the EU while
capturing value that could contribute to European industrial growth. If even 15 % of this
spending were retained within the European economy by 2035, an estimated 500 000 jobs
could be created locally. This dynamic means that, in practice, Europe exports public money
and imports long-term dependency, weakening its industrial base and its ability to govern
essential digital infrastructure. Even retaining a modest share of this spending domestically
would generate hundreds of thousands of high-skilled jobs and significantly strengthen
European technological sovereignty.

In terms of barriers to the adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open-source
solutions, procurement and risk management models are a recurring theme. In many cases,
spending continues to favour the purchase of âproductâ over life-cycle financing.

This approach is particularly detrimental to open-source, because the most significant benefits
are obtained when investing in maintenance, support, hardening, audit and upstream
development, i.e., in the substance of security and reliability. Moreover, cultural resistances
remain linked to the idea that open-source implies a lack of responsibility or support, while the
reality is more articulated: with adequate governance and targeted contracts, open-source
reduces the risk of lock-in and allows greater control over the supply chain, because it allows
independent verification and multiple suppliers.

A further obstacle is the maturity in the management of the software supply chain. Modern
security depends less and less on the âsingle productâ and more and more on the chain of
dependencies. Without established practices of inventory, traceability, updating and
vulnerability management, any technology becomes fragile. In this sense, open-source is not a
weakness, but an opportunity: code transparency makes it possible to build stronger assurance
processes, provided that appropriate operational standards are in place. Finally, sustainable
contributions to communities are constrained by a lack of incentives and organisational
structures. If the upstream contribution remains an occasional, unrecognised and unplanned
activity, then the community loses strength and the end user finds themselves with non-
upstreamed forks and customisations that increase maintenance costs and reduce security.

To sum up, the EU has a potential comparative advantage: it can build technological sovereignty
not by pursuing autarky, but by investing in open skills, communities and processes that make
the ecosystem more competitive, plural and controllable. However, to turn this potential into
concrete resilience, a paradigm shift is needed: financing the life cycle and sustainability, not
just adoption. Bureaucracy also hinders the natural development of open-source solutions.

and regulations.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please provide
concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation,
among others) that are most important to assess the added value.

The added value of open-source for the public and private sectors should be understood as a
set of technological, economic and strategic benefits that, over time, have direct effects on
competitiveness. In the public sector, the first element is a reduction in lock-in and an increase
in negotiating capacity. The availability of the code and the possibility to choose between

several suppliers allow avoiding critical dependencies and guaranteeing business continuity
even when commercial conditions or industrial policies change.

Open-source also facilitates reuse: an investment made by one administration can be reused by
others, reducing duplication and accelerating the modernisation of digital services. This is
particularly relevant in domains that require transversal interoperability, such as digital
identity, document systems, registry integration, service access platforms, administrative flow
management, and collaboration tools.

This approach is consistent with recent EU Council Conclusion, which explicitly call for
âenhancing transparency, interoperability and competition, while reducing vendor lock-in and
reliance on single providers, including through open standards, open-source and interoperable
solutionsâ2 when it comes to the reinforcement of digital sovereignty. (Council of the European
Union, 2025, para. 27).

In these contexts, the cost is not the license, but the integration, security and evolution of the
service; open-source makes it possible to focus spending precisely on these aspects, increasing
the return for the citizen.

In the private sector, open-source is a productivity multiplier and an innovation accelerator.
Companies can build differentiating solutions by relying on established infrastructure
components, reducing development time and cost of entry into digital markets. Open-source
makes it easier to adopt modern architectures, improve portability between environments and
reduce reliance on closed platforms, increasing industrial resilience. In addition, the existence
of active communities is a permanent channel of knowledge and updating: participating in
these communities, including through targeted contributions, means training in-house
expertise and maintaining constant contact with the state of the art. In a strategic IT industry,
this continuing education capability is as much a competitive advantage as the technology itself,
because it reduces the cost of adapting to change and improves the ability to respond to
incidents and vulnerabilities.

When assessing value added, the total cost of ownership is central, but it should be understood
correctly. Open-source does not mean âfreeâ: it means being able to allocate expenditure on
maintenance, support and security, with greater transparency and with the possibility of
avoiding position rents linked to licenses. Another key factor is risk management: open-source
enables independent audits and facilitates the rapid correction of vulnerabilities, especially
when mature dependency management practices are in place. Interoperability is also crucial,
because in multi-supplier European markets and administrations it reduces integration costs
and allows for real competition.

Finally, industrial value is often underestimated: adopting open-source and supporting
communities means strengthening European skills and supply chains of services, consultancy,
support and development, with direct repercussions on qualified employment and production
capacity on the continent.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

Open-source software is the foundational layer of nearly all sovereign digital infrastructure.
Unlike proprietary platforms, open-source tools offer transparency, modifiability, and long-
term sustainability, making them ideal for critical public services. Open-source should not be
treated as a âfree by-productâ of the digital economy but as strategic infrastructure.
A powerful and concrete way to support the European open-source ecosystem is for the EU
institutions themselves â starting with the Commission, the Council and the Parliament, to
migrate 100% of their internal IT systems to open-source software within five years, according
to a mandatory progressive plan with measurable milestones. This includes operating
systems, email servers, videoconferencing platforms, messaging tools, document
sharing systems, collaborative suites and vertical administrative applications.
This is not utopia â it is already happening, at a small scale. The grant management systems
used by European institutions for contribution applications are already based on open-source
platforms and prove that complex and sensitive workflows can be handled transparently,
efficiently and securely, using software that is fully auditable and under institutional control.
What works for managing funding should also work for internal collaboration and critical
services.
Such an internal commitment by the EU would immediately strengthen demand for open-
source tools, reduce strategic dependencies on foreign vendors, and act as a catalyst for
European technological sovereignty. The best way to support the European open-source
ecosystem is to use it as a core infrastructure, not just to promote it rhetorically.
We therefore call on the European Commission to recognise open-source as a pillar of digital
sovereignty and to support it through:

    â¢ dedicated funding instruments, including grants, procurement mandates, and long-term
      maintenance programs;
    â¢ integration into digital industrial policy and state aid frameworks;
    â¢ preferential treatment in public-sector digital transformation programs;
    â¢ recognition that some projects may be single-person efforts without formal legal
      personality.

To support the development and growth of European open-source and contribute to
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity, the EU can target three mutually reinforcing
levers: public demand, community sustainability, and less bureaucracy.
Nevertheless, AIIP recalls that in any case the support should not be targeted to create
âchampionsâ or âopen-source factoriesâ but aimed to grant funding to independent open-source
projects and authors, mostly indirectly, by reducing all of the bureaucratic issues (directives,
regulations) that may hamper the adoption of open-source solutions (e.g. CRA, CSA, and such).
The Internet that we all use today is built on open-source software that works perfectly even if
it has been developed and used without the burden of new regulations.
First, procurement policy can be made more consistent with the nature of open-source,
shifting the focus from the mere purchase of solutions to life-cycle assurance. This means
promoting contracts that include multi-year maintenance, audits, hardening and upstream
development as expected results, incentivising investment in what makes software reliable
over time. Such an orientation would have a systemic effect: it would strengthen communities,
reduce hard-to-maintain local forks and increase overall security, as corrections and
improvements would be brought back upstream.
Second, on the cybersecurity front, the EU can support programmes dedicated to critical open-
source components, with independent audits, improved release practices, dependency tracking
and coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes. The aim should be to make adoption easier
and safer, reducing the risk for administrations and businesses. An important element is the
creation of stewardship capabilities on strategic components, funding maintenance and
security teams working in collaboration with communities, with clear metrics on patching
times, release quality and vulnerability reduction.
Thirdly, the EU needs to invest in conscious and active training, because technological
sovereignty is not achieved only by purchasing technologies, but by creating skills that can
understand, control and evolve them. European programmes that support the emergence of
open-source program offices in the public sector, and that favour similar structures in the
private sector, would make upstream contribution a normal and recognised activity, not an
exception. In parallel, training initiatives focused on development, security, compliance and
supply chain management can increase the operational capacity to adopt open-source in an
industrial way.
In this way, the EU would build a competitive ecosystem: more internal skills, more companies
able to offer professional services, more competition and fewer structural dependencies.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

Technological priorities should be selected on the basis of their ability to enable a competitive
and sovereign European ecosystem, i.e., capable of governing infrastructure, data and security
without critically depending on external actors. In this sense, basic digital infrastructure is a
priority because it is the platform on which public and private services are based: cloud,
virtualization, orchestration, automation, observability, and identity management determine
portability, business continuity, and cost control capabilities.

Strengthening a European open-source ecosystem in these areas means reducing systemic
dependencies and creating industrial opportunities for European support and integration
providers.

Cybersecurity is a second natural priority, both for operational tools and for cryptographic
fundamentals and key management. Investing in reliable and auditable open-source
components produces cross-cutting benefits, because many proprietary products also rely on
open-source libraries and tools. Making these components more robust and better maintained
increases the resilience of the entire value chain. This should not reflect in obligations for
authors or support resellers, but in aids to the authors or to the community to strengthen the
security characteristics of their product. Please also consider that there are daily releases,
preventing âcertificationsâ.

A third area concerns interoperability and data: middleware, databases, standards, APIs,
governance tools and data exchange. In a European market characterised by linguistic,
regulatory and administrative diversity, interoperability is a multiplier of efficiency and
competitiveness, and open-source can provide common, verifiable and reusable foundations.

Finally, AI deserves a particular priority, especially in infrastructure components and tools that
ensure transparency, reproducibility and control. For Europe, open-source in this domain is not
only a choice of efficiency, but a precondition for accountability and verifiability, which are
consistent with trust and compliance needs.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open-source lead to increased competitiveness
and cyber resilience?

Increased use of open-source can strengthen competitiveness and resilience especially in
sectors where digital transformation is already crucial for productivity and where security has
a direct impact on service continuity. In the public sector, health, justice, education and citizen
services benefit from interoperable, auditable and reusable platforms, reducing duplication
costs and increasing the capacity to evolve. In these areas, resilience depends not only on âsafeâ
technologies, but also on understanding and governing them: open-source fosters this capacity,

by making choices transparent and developing in-house expertise, including through
collaboration with European communities and suppliers.

Just think to what happened with the Internet. Most of the services we all use today are built on
open-source projects.

In critical infrastructure, such as energy, transport, telecommunications and water
management, open-source can help reduce opaque dependencies and increase the speed of
vulnerability response, thanks to the possibility of independent audits and a plurality of actors
able to intervene. Manufacturing and automation can also gain significant competitive
advantages through open-source components for edge computing, integration and
observability, as they reduce the cost of interoperability between heterogeneous systems and
foster more open innovation chains.

In the financial and insurance sector, open-source can increase resilience through more
transparent dependency management processes and increased audit capacity, as well as foster
agility in the development of digital services. More generally, the entire ecosystem of European
digital SMEs benefits from open-source because it reduces technological entry barriers and
allows them to compete on quality, integration and service.

When accompanied by conscious formation and active participation in communities, this model
builds sovereignty in the full sense: not only independence from individual suppliers, but the
continent's ability to understand, control and evolve technologies that support economy, rights
and security.
