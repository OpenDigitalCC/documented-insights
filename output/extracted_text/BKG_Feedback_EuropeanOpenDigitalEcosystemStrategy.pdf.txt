1        What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-
         source sector? What are the main barriers that hamper (1.1)
         adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open
         source; and (1.2) sustainable contributions to open-source
         communities?

1.1      Barriers to the adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open
         source
From the perspective of the BKG at the federal level, a recurring pattern can be seen in the federal
system: from the federal and state governments to small municipalities, very similar geospatial
tasks arise â preparing geodata, keeping it up to date, and making it available as standard -based
data products or web services for the population, partners, and other administrations. At the same
time, implementation and procurement are often the responsibility of the respective levels; the
BKG cannot enforce recommendations centrally here, but is dependent on cooperation, reuse, and
common standards. In practice, however, these tasks are often solved in isolation â each
organization builds comparable services, interfaces, map applications, and data processes in
parallel instead of reusing them consistently.
This leads to avoidable duplication of development work, higher costs, and a fragmented
landscape, even though the solutions could in principle be developed, refined, and scaled jointly.
This weakens long-term maintainability and reliable security provision because maintenance and
updates are not bundled. In addition, lock-in structures, which tie customers closely to a provider
or technology, make migration and changing providers difficult â in the geo sector, not only in
terms of file formats, but also in terms of data models, geodatabases, styli ng/cartography assets,
integration patterns, workflows, and algorithmic analysis methods that have been anchored in
specialist processes and automation over many years. This reinforces isolated solutions and
inhibits scalable reuse. Another bottleneck is procurement: even if there is a willingness to use
open source, procurement processes are often difficult to manage. Operation, support, and
security updates cannot always be mapped and evaluated in such a way that open solutions can
be procured fairly and comparably.

1.2      Barriers to sustainable contributions to open-source communities
A further structural issue affects sustainable contributions: open source is widely used, but many
users contribute little in terms of funding or ongoing development. As a re sult, development,
maintenance, and security fixes are often underfunded and not secured on a long -term basis.

2        What is the added value of open source for the public and
         private sectors? Please provide concrete examples,
         including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security,
         innovation, among others) that are most important to assess
         the added value.
Public institutions benefit from open source products in many ways: federal, state, and local
governments can more easily share developments, jointly further develop them, and thus avoid
duplication of workâwhile also reducing life cycle costs. This added value is particularly evident

                                                                                                  2

when administrations work together in implementation communities (such as in the development
of the open source project âMasterportalâ): Components are developed jointly, experiences are
shared, and operation and maintenance are bundled more efficiently.
The added value is particularly high in the area of geodata and geoservices because
interoperability, long-term data sovereignty, and reusability are crucial. Geoservices are often not
only used internally but also provided as digital services for the public, businesses, and partner
authorities. Open, standards-based interfaces and formats (e.g., OGC-compliant
interfaces/services) make these offerings interoperable, scalable, and operable in the long term â
independent of individual manufacturers or platforms.
Open source reduces strategic risks: it creates a real exit option (it remains possible to switch
service providers and operating models) and, through transparency, strengthens verifiable security
and the traceability of dependencies in the software supply chain. In the geo -context in particular,
it is important to note that lock-in arises not only through file formats, but also through data models,
integrations, workflows, and established analysis methodsâopen solutions facilitate migration and
further development in the long term.
Civil society and the economy also benefit when publicly funded software is made available as
open source: reuse enables further development and value creation across organizational
boundaries, so that solutions can be used and further developed beyond individual institutions.

3        What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU
         level to support the development and growth of the EU open-
         source sector and contribute to the EUâs technological
         sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

3.1      Strengthen and scale implementation communities
Implementation communities pool domain and technical know-how, share resources, and reduce
duplicate work. This is crucial in the public sector: scarce budgetary resources can be used more
efficiently, skills shortages are mitigated through joint further development and knowledge sharing,
and quality, maintainability, and security improve through aligned standards and reusable modules
(e.g. the open source project Masterportal).

3.2      Practical tendering and procurement frameworks for open source
Open source solutions often do not fail because of technical suitability, but b ecause of
cumbersome procurement processes. Model clauses and evaluation criteria that can be used
throughout the EU should be formulated in functional and standards -based terms and clearly cover
operations, support, and security updates as procurable services, so that open solutions can be
assessed and procured on a fair, like-for-like basis.

3.3      Binding requirements and measurable indicators
To ensure that interoperability, reuse, and migration capability do not remain mere statements of
intent, clear minimum requirements and verifiable evidence are needed. This creates planning
certainty for vendors and public administrations and strengthens enforceability against lock -in
structures.

                                                                                                      3

3.4      Exit plans as a standard requirement for critical systems
For core digital infrastructures, possibilities for data portability, open interfaces, and the ability to
switch providers should be embedded as requirements. In the geospatial domain, this explicitly
concerns not only formats, but also data models, integrations, workflows, and cartography/styling
assetsâso that an exit remains practically feasible.

3.5      Stable, multi-year funding for maintenance and security
Beyond project-based funding, mechanisms are needed to secure the long-term upkeep of critical
components: security fixes, testing, documentation, and hardening must be sustainably fundable
and institutionally anchored. This ensures open source is not only developed, but also reliably
operated and made resilient over its lifecycle.

4        What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

4.1      Operational interoperability (standards, profiles, conformity in practice)
Priority should be given to technical foundations that ensure solutions genuinely work together
across organisations and bordersâand therefore not merely that they are formally âstandards-
compliantâ. This is a prerequisite for public digital services to scale, to be reusable, and not to fail
due to small but critical differences in implementations.

4.2      Portability and migration capability (switching options without rebuilding
         from scratch)
Competitiveness and digital sovereignty increase when systems are structured so that ongoing
evolution and switching platforms or service providers remain realistic. This is particularly visible
in the geospatial domain, because dependencies arise not only through data formats, but can
become embedded over years in data models, integrations, workflows, cartography/styling, and
domain-specific analytical functions.

5        In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead
         to increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
An increased use of open source can strengthen competitiveness and cyber resilience, especially
where digital infrastructures are operated on a permanent basis and dependencies are particularly
significant â particularly in public administration, critical infrastructures, research, and other
security-related areas. In the geo context, the leverage is particularly great because geodata and
geoservices are involved in a wide range of tasks (includi ng planning, transport, the environment,
and crisis situations) and are often provided as digital services for the public and partners.
At the same time, the geo-industry is characterized by market concentration and changes in
licensing/pricing models, which leads to rising costs amid tight public budgets and reinforces lock -
in effects. More open source strengthens competition here (via open interfaces and
interchangeable operating and support models), reduces dependencies, and improves resilience
because transparency, maintainability, and the provision of security updates can be managed
more effectively across the lifecycle. The consistent continuation of the EU open source strategy
as a contribution to the digital sovereignty of public administration and c ivil society is supported
and warmly welcomed.
