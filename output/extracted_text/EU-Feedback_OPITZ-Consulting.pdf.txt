Feedback on the initiative âEuropean Open Digital Ecosystemsâ

As a medium-sized IT consulting and service company based in Germany with a
clear German and European market orientation, we strongly welcome the European
Commissionâs initiative to strengthen European open digital ecosystems.

We have deliberately positioned ourselves as a German and European company
and see open digital ecosystems as a key lever for strengthening Europeâs
technological sovereignty and stronger independence for global player from other
markets. For small and medium-sized enterprises, reducing dependencies on
proprietary, non-European platforms and individual large vendors is of strategic
importance.

Open-source software and open standards are not a theoretical concept for us, but
an integral part of our daily consulting practice. We make extensive use of open
source in customer projects and benefit from it in multiple ways:

   â¢   increased transparency and control over the technologies used

   â¢   greater adaptability to customer-specific requirements

   â¢   reduced vendor lock-in risks

   â¢   sustainable cost structures across the entire lifecycle of IT solutions

As IT consultants, we identify strong client value in open-source solutions and
therefore prefer and recommend and even advocate their use to them.

These benefits do not only apply to us, but in particular to our customers across the
EU.

From our perspective, open source is especially supportive of an SME-oriented
information and communication technology (ICT) economy. Open technologies
enable small and medium-sized providers to develop innovative solutions with less

risk and effort and thus remain competitive without becoming dependent on large,
globally operating corporations.

In this way, open source makes an important contribution to:

   â¢   fairer market conditions,

   â¢   diversity of innovation,

   â¢   regional value creation, and

   â¢   a more resilient Digital Single Market.

Against this background, we explicitly support any measures by the European Union
that aim to systematically promote, stabilize and ensure the long-term sustainability
of open-source technologies.

To further ease and accelerate the practical adoption of open source, we see the
following policy actions as particularly relevant:

   â¢   Legal and public procurement clarity, including explicit equal treatment or
       preferential consideration of open-source solutions and use of open
       standards in public tenders.

   â¢   Legal support for open-source projects to set up simple IP and governance
       frameworks that keep commercial influence transparent and controllable.

   â¢   Funding programs for maintenance and long-term, uninterrupted support of
       open-source core technologies, not limited to new development activities.

   â¢   Infrastructural support to provide European-hosted alternatives to dominant
       non-European platforms (e.g., GitHub) for code hosting and collaboration,
       reducing systemic dependencies.

   â¢   Standardised framework contracts and reference architectures to lower entry
       barriers for SMEs in open-source-based projects.

   â¢   Initiate and use support definition of open standards.

   â¢   Greater visibility of successful European open-source projects to build trust
       and acceptance among companies and public-sector organisations.

   â¢   Simple and accessible funding schemes with lean application processes and
       fast decision cycles, reducing administrative burdens and enabling SMEs and
       smaller projects to participate effectively.

   â¢   Actively found and manage essential open-source based projects for key
       technologies, infrastructure elements and special functionalities, that would
       else not exist as open-source due to initial efforts and costs up to an initial
       MVP.

   â¢   Support acceptance of open-source product in governmental organisations
       as valuable alternative by increasing visibility of such approaches by initiating
       conferences, discussion groups, concept studies and active research
       regarding long-term value-creation of open-source usage.

From the perspective of a medium-sized IT consulting company, the âEuropean
Open Digital Ecosystemsâ initiative represents an important and necessary step
towards strengthening innovation, competitiveness and digital sovereignty in
Europe. We stand ready to support this path in an active and constructive manner.

In addition to the above general comments, we would like to explicitly respond to
the Commissionâs consultation questions as follows.

Q1: Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector; barriers to adoption,
maintenance and sustainable contributions

Strengths of the EU opensource sector

   â¢   A strong SME base and consulting ecosystem that builds and operates
       solutions on open source, creating practical implementation capacity across
       member states.

   â¢   High alignment with European values such as transparency, auditability, and
       shared innovation, supporting digital sovereignty and resilience.

   â¢   Growing interest and demand from regulated industries and public
       administrations that increasingly recognise the strategic value of open
       technologies.

Â© OPITZ CONSULTING Deutschland GmbH 2026                                                   3
Weaknesses of the EU open-source sector

   â¢   Fragmentation and limited mechanisms to scale promising initiatives across
       countries, sectors and administrations.

   â¢   A persistent âmaintenance and security gapâ: long-term maintenance,
       hardening and release engineering are often underfunded compared to new
       feature development.

   â¢   Structural dependency on non-EU collaboration and distribution
       infrastructure (code hosting, CI/CD, artifact registries), which creates systemic
       risk.

Barriers hampering adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open
source

   â¢   Performance expectancy: Decision makers often question enterprise
       readiness (support and SLA models, roadmap predictability, accountability
       and security assurance).

   â¢   Effort expectancy: Perceived migration and operational effort, skills gaps and
       change-management overhead create high switching costs, especially in
       legacy environments.

   â¢   Social influence: Strong incumbent vendor ecosystems, established
       procurement habits and risk-averse organisational cultures reinforce âdefault
       proprietaryâ choices.

   â¢   Facilitating conditions: Legal and procurement uncertainty, missing reference
       architectures and lack of EU-hosted infrastructure limit adoption even where
       the technical quality of open source is high.

Barriers hampering sustainable contributions to open-source communities

   â¢   Insufficient and discontinuous incentives for maintainer work (including
       security patches, triage, documentation and long-term support), leading to
       burnout risks.

   â¢   Legal and governance complexity, including uncertainty around IP setup,
       liability and governance models, which can discourage organisations and
       individuals from long-term engagement.

Â© OPITZ CONSULTING Deutschland GmbH 2026                                                4
   â¢   High Security and compliance requirements (e.g. coordinated disclosure,
       signing, SBOMs) that add non-trivial overhead when adequate tooling and
       funding are missing, especially for smaller projects.

Q2: Added value of open source for public and private sectors; concrete examples
and key factors

Added value for the public sector

Open-source acts as a digital public good: it enables reuse of taxpayer-funded
software, increases transparency and auditability of critical systems, and reduces
long-term lock-in to proprietary products. Instead of repeatedly paying license fees
for commodity functions, public administrations can invest in maintainable, reusable
components and shared platforms.

Added value for the private sector

For private sector organisations, open source reduces dependency on single
vendors, improves portability across infrastructures, accelerates innovation through
modular ecosystems, and strengthens security through transparency and faster
patch cycles. It supports flexible sourcing and multi-vendor models, which is
particularly relevant for SMEs and European IT providers.

Key factors to assess added value

In our experience, the following factors are most important when assessing the
added value of open source:

   â¢   Total cost of ownership (licences, runtime, operations, upgrades)

   â¢   Lock-in and exit costs (portability, interoperability, multi-vendor
       supportability)

   â¢   Risk (operational risk, vendor concentration risk, upgrade and roadmap risk)

   â¢   Security (auditability, patch lead time, supply-chain transparency)

   â¢   Innovation speed (time-to-market, extensibility, ecosystem leverage)

Â© OPITZ CONSULTING Deutschland GmbH 2026                                               5
Concrete examples from our customer projects (anonymised)

   â¢   Database modernisation away from proprietary dependence:
       In several engagements, we supported customers in reducing their reliance
       on proprietary databases by migrating selected workloads to an open-source
       database stack, including operational tooling for availability, monitoring and
       backup. The main outcomes were lower recurring licensing pressure,
       improved portability across hosting options, and greater transparency in
       operations and troubleshooting. The decisive factors were TCO, reduced lock-
       in, and operational flexibility.

   â¢   Integration landscape modernisation beyond proprietary SOA:
       We also supported customers in modernising integration landscapes that
       had been centred on proprietary SOA suites by adopting an open integration
       approach (API-centric integration and event-/message-based patterns,
       depending on context). This led to faster change cycles, better
       interoperability with modern cloud and edge workloads, and reduced
       dependence on single-vendor release schedules and licensing models. The
       decisive factors were innovation speed, risk reduction, and interoperability.

Q3: EU-level measures and actions for the EU open-source sector, technological
sovereignty and cybersecurity

Building on our general recommendations above, we consider the following EU-level
measures particularly impactful:

   â¢   Long-term, uninterrupted funding for maintenance and security work of
       critical open-source components (including long-term support, bug fixing,
       CI/release engineering), not limited to new features.

   â¢   Legal and governance/IP support for open-source projects: provision of
       lightweight, reusable templates and access to legal expertise so that projects
       can set up IP and governance structures that keep commercial influence
       transparent and controllable.

   â¢   Public procurement clarity and opensource friendly purchasing: explicit equal
       treatment of open-source solutions in tenders, outcome-based

Â© OPITZ CONSULTING Deutschland GmbH 2026                                                6
       requirements, and standardised framework contracts and reference
       architectures so that SMEs can participate more easily.

   â¢   European-hosted infrastructure support: investment in EU-based code
       hosting, CI/CD, artifact registries and collaboration tooling to reduce systemic
       dependency on dominant non-European platforms.

   â¢   Simple, accessible funding schemes for SMEs and smaller projects with lean
       application processes and fast decision cycles (including micro-grants and
       rolling calls).

   â¢   Support for software supply-chain security practices:

           o   promotion of standardized, machine-readable SBOMs for publicly
               funded and widely deployed components,

           o   funding of tooling and automation for SBOM generation, signing and
               continuous vulnerability monitoring in CI/CD,

           o   use of public procurement to reward supply-chain transparency
               (SBOM plus vulnerability disclosure practices) with proportionate
               requirements.

   â¢   Visibility and adoption enablement: EU-level catalogues and showcases of
       mature projects, guidance and âplaybooksâ for public administrations, and
       communities of practice to accelerate trusted adoption.

   â¢   Strategic seeding of essential open-source-based initiatives for key
       technologies and infrastructure elements (including outreach and
       community-building) where high initial effort would otherwise prevent open-
       source alternatives from emerging.

   â¢   Further initiation and support of open standards in order to increase
       interoperability of and compatibility between open-source software artefacts.
       This will make the ability to integrate such artefacts to flexible and bigger
       suites more likely and easier. Such standards also allow integration of
       proprietary software with less risk.

Q4: Technology areas to prioritize and why

We suggest prioritizing technology areas that reduce systemic dependencies,
strengthen cybersecurity and enable interoperable European ecosystems:

   â¢   Software supply-chain security (SBOMs, signing, reproducible builds,
       vulnerability management) as a cross-sector foundation for cyber resilience.

   â¢   EU-hosted developer and collaboration infrastructure (code hosting, CI/CD,
       registries) as a strategic dependency that should be under EU jurisdiction and
       aligned with EU values.

   â¢   Interoperability middleware and open standards, including reference
       implementations, which enable cross-organisational data exchange and
       European data spaces.

   â¢   Cloud-to-edge foundation layers (identity, orchestration, observability, policy
       enforcement) to keep workloads portable and avoid hyperscaler lock-in.

   â¢   Sovereign, open and auditable AI platforms (from data management and
       training to inference and MLOps), enabling trusted AI adoption under EU data
       protection and governance frameworks.

Q5: Sectors where increased open-source use can improve competitiveness and
cyber resilience

In our view, increased use of open source can particularly improve competitiveness
and cyber resilience in the following sectors:

   â¢   Public sector: open source as a digital public good enables reuse of taxpayer-
       funded solutions, improves transparency and auditability, and reduces long-
       term dependence on proprietary vendors for essential administrative
       functions.

   â¢   Industry and automotive: competitiveness increasingly depends on open
       standards and interoperable reference implementations to enable cross-
       company collaboration and supply-chain resilience. Initiatives such as Catena-
       X illustrate the importance of interoperability and shared models across an
       entire ecosystem.

Â© OPITZ CONSULTING Deutschland GmbH 2026                                                 8
   â¢   Critical infrastructure and regulated sectors (energy, healthcare, telecom,
       transport): here, transparent security practices, supply-chain visibility (e.g.
       through SBOMs), and reduced single-vendor concentration risks are
       especially important.

   â¢   Education and research (optional emphasis): open source accelerates
       knowledge transfer, skills development and the diffusion of innovation into
       the broader economy.

Summary and conclusion

Open-source software and open standards already play a central role in our daily
work with customers and have proven its value in concrete modernisation and
migration projects. We see major strengths and potential in the EU open-source
sector, but also structural weaknesses and barriers that can and should be
addressed at European level.

By providing legal and procurement clarity, supporting long-term maintenance and
security work, investing in EU-based infrastructure and strategic technology areas
(including sovereign AI platforms and supply-chain security), and by lowering access
barriers for SMEs and the public sector, the European Union can significantly
strengthen its sovereignty, competitiveness and cyber resilience.

We would be pleased to contribute our practical experience from consulting and
implementation projects to further discussions and follow-up work on the
âEuropean Open Digital Ecosystemsâ initiative.
