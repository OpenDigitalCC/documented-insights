Executive summary
Europe has become a rule-maker in the digital domain, but much of the underlying infrastructure that
executes those rules remains non-European and highly concentrated. This creates a practical
sovereignty gap: policy ambition depends on systems Europe does not fully control. The Commissionâs
initiative is timely because open source can increase auditability, reduce lock-in, and improve supply
chain transparency, but openness alone does not guarantee sovereignty. Sovereignty becomes real
when governance, operational control, and credible exit paths are designed into the infrastructure.

The European Decentralisation Institute (EDI) recommends a compact set of measures that convert
Europeâs open-source strength into scalable, secure, and deployable capabilities across cloud and edge,
AI, cybersecurity, open hardware, and industrial platforms. The core idea is simple: use EU policy and
funding to make open, interoperable, and verifiable building blocks cheaper to adopt than proprietary
lock-in. Pair that with governance standards, long-term maintenance funding, and procurement
practices that measure exit costs and systemic risk.

Key recommendations (high impact, near-term)

    Â· â Make interoperability and portability testable: fund open test suites and conformance labs for
        cloud, data, and AI stacks.
    Â· â Shift procurement incentives: require an âexit and auditabilityâ scorecard for public sector IT
        and EU-funded deployments.
    Â· â Fund maintenance as infrastructure: create multi-year support for critical open-source
        dependencies, security audits, and incident response.
    Â· â Strengthen governance by design: set minimum governance criteria for âstrategicâ open
        projects used in critical sectors.
    Â· â Back European âfoundation infrastructureâ: repositories, package registries, CI/CD tooling, and
        sovereign hosting options under EU jurisdiction.
    Â· â Use blended finance to scale EU open-source firms: crowd-in private capital while preserving
        open licensing and community stewardship.

                                                                                                                 1
1. Context and problem definition
The call for evidence correctly frames open source as a strategic lever for competitiveness,
cybersecurity, and reduced external dependencies. Two barriers deserve special emphasis. First,
Europeâs dependency is structural. For example, the Commission notes that open-source software is
deeply embedded in the economy and that the EU faces dependence on non-EU countries in the
digital sphere. Second, scaling is the bottleneck. Past EU investments delivered strong projects, but
research and innovation funding alone rarely produces durable maintenance, governance, and
adoption at scale.

EDIâs perspective, aligned with our November 2025 policy brief, is that the objective should not be to
replace foreign concentration with a single European champion. The goal is a competitive and
resilient ecosystem, where control over keys, code, and control planes is distributed to the lowest
competent level (a digital form of subsidiarity), and where users have credible exit paths across
implementations.

3. Answers to the consultation questions (Q1 to Q5)
Q1. Strengths, weaknesses, and barriers (adoption, maintenance, sustainable
contributions)
Strengths

    Â· â Large and value-aligned developer communities, with strong public interest orientation and
        technical expertise.
    Â· â A track record of EU support that produced credible building blocks (for example NGI, FIWARE,
        Simpl, RISC-V, and open vehicle software stacks).
    Â· â Regulatory leadership that can translate into demand for verifiable, auditable, and
        privacy-preserving solutions.

Weaknesses and barriers

    Â· â Scaling gap: projects often lack long-term maintenance funding, productisation support, and
        clear deployment pathways.
    Â· â Procurement and contracting practices that reward incumbency and low headline price, not exit
        costs, auditability, or long-term resilience.
    Â· â Concentration and hosting dependencies (code repositories, package registries, CI/CD) that sit
        outside EU jurisdiction.
    Â· â Fragmentation across Member States in requirements, certification, and liability expectations,
        which raises the cost of cross-border adoption.
    Â· â Governance bottlenecks: unclear decision rights, limited transparency, and capture risk when a
        single vendor dominates a nominally open project.

Q2. Added value of open source for public and private sectors (with examples)
Open source reduces lock-in by making interfaces inspectable and by enabling competitive
re-implementation. It improves security and supply chain transparency through reviewability,
SBOM-driven dependency management, and faster vulnerability remediation. It also increases strategic
flexibility because services can be moved, forked, or maintained even if a supplier exits.

Concrete examples include open middleware for European data spaces (Simpl), open and interoperable
cloud stacks, open hardware ecosystems such as RISC-V for targeted use cases, and open industrial
platforms such as software-defined vehicle stacks where interoperability lowers supplier concentration
risk. In the public sector, open source can turn one-off procurements into reusable digital public goods
across administrations.

Q3. EU-level measures to grow the EU open-source sector and strengthen sovereignty
and cybersecurity
Procurement as a scaling lever

    Â· â Introduce an âexit and auditabilityâ scorecard for public procurement and EU-funded
        deployments, including switching time, key custody, and auditability.

                                                    3
    Â· â Require open standards and documented migration paths for strategic systems, so open
        alternatives can compete on equal footing.

Maintenance and security as shared infrastructure

    Â· â Create multi-year maintenance funding for critical dependencies, including dedicated security
        audits and coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
    Â· â Stand up an EU capacity for rapid response to critical open-source vulnerabilities used in
        government and critical sectors.

Testability and interoperability

    Â· â Fund open test suites, reference implementations, and conformance labs for cloud, data
        spaces, AI tooling, and identity building blocks.
    Â· â Make conformance results publicly available to reduce due diligence costs for adopters and to
        reward trustworthy projects.

Governance by design

    Â· â Define minimum governance criteria for strategic projects: transparent roadmaps,
        multi-stakeholder oversight, reproducible builds, and documented change control.
    Â· â Tie EU funding eligibility to governance and sustainability plans, not only technical novelty.

Finance and market integration

    Â· â Use blended finance and guarantees to scale EU open-source firms, while preserving open
        licensing and community stewardship.
    Â· â Support commercialisation services (legal, compliance, procurement readiness) that help SMEs
        sell into regulated sectors.

Q4. Priority technology areas (and why)
    Â· â Cloud and edge infrastructure: highest dependency exposure and strong lock-in dynamics,
        decisive for data and compute control.
    Â· â Cybersecurity components and secure supply chain tooling: the foundation for trust, resilience,
        and vulnerability management.
    Â· â Open and auditable AI models, tooling, and datasets: to enable European oversight,
        provenance, and competitive innovation.
    Â· â Open hardware (including RISC-V ecosystems) where it improves security, flexibility, and
        industrial competitiveness.
    Â· â Industrial and automotive digital platforms: Europeâs core economic sectors need
        interoperable, secure, and upgradeable foundations.
    Â· â Identity and trust services as cross-cutting enablers for e-government and regulated digital
        services.

                                                   4
Q5. Sectors where open source can boost competitiveness and cyber resilience
    Â· â Public administrations and digital government, including cross-border services and digital
        public infrastructure.
    Â· â Healthcare and life sciences, where auditability and security are preconditions for scale.
    Â· â Energy and mobility, including smart grids, charging networks, and connected vehicles.
    Â· â Manufacturing and critical supply chains, where interoperability reduces integration costs and
        strengthens SME participation.
    Â· â Financial services and payments, where resilience, auditability, and strong change control are
        essential.
    Â· â Education and research, where open source accelerates skills, reuse, and innovation diffusion.

4. Monitoring and evaluation (what to measure)
The Commissionâs strategy will benefit from a small set of operational metrics that track whether
dependency is actually shrinking and whether open solutions are becoming easier to adopt. We
suggest a short dashboard, reported annually, that can be used in procurement and programme
evaluation.

    Â· â Exit and switching time for strategic systems (measured in days and cost bands).
    Â· â Key custody and operational control (who holds cryptographic keys and who can change
        system rules).
    Â· â SBOM coverage and vulnerability management performance for procured software
        (time-to-patch, disclosure processes).
    Â· â Sustainability of critical dependencies (maintainer funding continuity, bus factor, governance
        maturity).
    Â· â Adoption and reuse in public procurement (number of deployments and cross-border reuse of
        digital public goods).

5. Closing and offer to engage
EDI supports the Commissionâs ambition to strengthen open digital ecosystems as a pillar of
technological sovereignty, competitiveness, and cybersecurity. The measures above are designed to be
implementable within existing instruments, while shifting incentives toward openness that scales. We
would welcome the opportunity to discuss pilots and metrics with DG CNECT and DG DIGIT, including
options to share a longer EDI positioning note where useful.
