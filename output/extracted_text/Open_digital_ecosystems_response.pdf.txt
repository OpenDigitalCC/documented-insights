Response to: Towards European open digital ecosystems
call for evidence
3 February 2026

About Platformable
Platformable is a Barcelona-based, purpose-focused business committed to supporting the development of
open digital ecosystems. This includes understanding regulatory environments, assisting in Data, API and
AI governance, promoting the use of standards, mapping ecosystem stakeholders and enablers, supporting
the delivery of API and data products (and the solutions built using APIs and data that serve user needs),
and identifying gaps and opportunities in ecosystems that can be leveraged to address challenges and
generate new opportunities. We work with global and local organisations to assist with data and research
collection and analysis, content delivery, go-to-market strategies, advocacy and policy work, and
analytics/impact measurement processes.

Platformable welcomes the opportunity to respond to the call for evidence on âTowards open digital
ecosystemsâ. We work with enterprises, SMEs, startups, industry associations, standards bodies, and
non-profit organisations on open digital ecosystems in which everyone can participate and co-create their
own value. This work has included projects supporting ecosystem development with World Bank, World
Health Organization, Member State health authorities, traceability of supply chain industry associations and
standards bodies, International future of software technology conferences, open banking and open finance
enterprises and scale-ups, and agrifood industry standards bodies.

                                                                                                                   1
Our definition of open digital ecosystems
While the call for evidence is laudable and it is exciting to see European policy recognise the value and
importance of open source technologies, we believe a definition of open digital ecosystems extends beyond
open source technologies.

Our definition is based on academic literature, global and European industry practices, grey literature, and
experiences with industry and non-profit associations:

        An open digital ecosystem is a network of stakeholders (including multilateral organisations,
        governments and regulators, standards bodies, industry associations, enterprises, SMEs, data and
        digital tools and service providers, researchers, nonprofits, community organisations, and
        individuals) that are able to co-create, collaborate, complement, coordinate and/or compete with
        each other equitably by using digital public and shared infrastructure, and common components and
        interfaces (including APIs, open standards, open data models, user interfaces, and open source
        technologies)1.

An open digital ecosystem as described above recognises the centrality of of open source technologies
alongside open standards and open data models, open APIs, open source AI components, digital public
infrastructure like payments rails and identity, cloud infrastructure, web browsers, and so on â all in service
to enabling market operations and to ensure the production of benefits and values that support society,
local economies and the environment (in line, for example, with the Sustainable Development Goals or with
European core values).

It is notable that the call for evidence does not actually give a definition of its own for open digital
ecosystems. It jumps from open digital ecosystems in the title of the consultation to then discussing the
âopen-source sectorâ and notes âa very active and rich ecosystem of communities of open-source
developers, among the largest worldwide, whose work is well aligned with EU digital rights and principles.â
One initial step the European Commission could take would be to define what it means by an open digital
ecosystem.

Given the direction of the call for evidence, we will predominantly focus our response on open source, but
we believe there are some limitations to the âopen source ecosystemâ lens. We think it is more valuable to
consider open digital ecosystems on a sectoral basis.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source
sector? What are the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and
maintenance of high-quality and secure open source; and (ii) sustainable
contributions to open-source communities?
Europe is home to a large number of passionate, open source developers, maintainers, strategists and
adopters, although there is a need for a survey instrument to calculate the size of the open source
community across Europe. Commercial products from Europe often provide an open source option, which
significantly helps startups and small businesses to compete internationally at minimal operational cost. For
example, at Platformable, we have used the French-based Strapi open source content management
system2 for close to 10 years now without having to pay any subscription costs, as we self-host an open

  Our definition has evolved following industry consultation across banking and finance, health, logistics, sustainability
and supply chain industries. We also provide specific definitions for each of the co-create, collaborate, complement,
coordinate and compete relationship types:

source instance of the software. Over the years, we have contributed to promoting and participating in
events and even building our own open source tooling to complement Strapiâs features. In a recent effort to
further align with both open source and European-built software as part of a digital sovereignty priority, we
have described our recent migration to other European-based and open source technology3.

Europe is fortunate to also have a sizable number of open source cloud providers including OVHCloud.
OVHCloud has a generous startup credits program4 which is allowing us to build faster and maintain more
products and digital services without cost.

However, one challenge we see for European based open source cloud providers, and for the open source
software that could be offered to be installed on their infrastructure is that ecosystem effects are not
leveraged on these cloud provider platforms.

Amongst several US cloud providers, there are often 1-click install options that make it easy for businesses
to adopt open source technologies within their cloud services without significant DevOps costs and
expertise. Competing against these established players by offering a similar installation option to ease
adoption amongst European cloud providers and open source technologies can be a burden. It takes time
and resources to build these 1-click installation options. There are multiple ways this could be fixed:
    ââ Instead of static directories like European Alternatives5 and EuroStack directories from EuroStack6
        and Digital SME Association7, a two-sided marketplace could be built so that users could select the
        cloud provider they are using, and the open source software they want to use and then use a
        one-click-type functionality to install that software into their cloud service. The European
        Commission could help encourage open source adoption by supporting the creation of this type of
        marketplace.
    ââ Alternatively, the European Commission as part of its work to support adoption of European open
        source, could assist European-based cloud providers to build these 1-click installations. This would
        also help European cloud providers âcatch upâ to US cloud options in this area. This could be done
        through challenges, incentives, or other mechanisms.

One of the key shortcomings we see is the lack of a fully-rounded open digital ecosystem systems-thinking
approach8. This limits open source stakeholders from identifying partnerships (like those cloud providers
they could partner with on one-click installations); from aligning with regulations and adopting key industry
standards; and from building features for new markets.

For example, we have developed open digital ecosystem models for key sectors. Open source
technologies are grouped under Data, API and AI Tools and Infrastructure in each of these models, but an
open digital ecosystem also recognises open standards, open data, open data models, and open APIs.
These components would all interact and be used to varying degrees by entities across the ecosystem
models presented.

General digital ecosystems12

Taking an open digital ecosystem planning and strategic approach would help open source software
providers identify:
   ââ What barriers and opportunities may affect adoption
   ââ Who they can collaborate with
   ââ Their potential positive and negative impacts
   ââ What data they could collect to demonstrate their theory of change impacts
   ââ The role of standards and regulations.

While this is done at a sectoral level, it can also be done at a member state or local level to identify finer
grain opportunities that align with local regulations and standards. It can even be done in sub-sectors, for
example, looking at the open digital ecosystem for payments (not the full open banking/open finance
ecosystem) in Belgium, for example. This would provide useful insight for open source digital wallets to
understand where they could enter the market or adapt their features to meet a payments use case, and so
on. Future governance of open digital ecosystems needs to be sectoral13. Current approaches to mapping
ecosystems focus on investment or local startup ecosystems, rather than encouraging the alignment
between regulations, standards, tools and open source technologies, datasets, and partnership
opportunities.

The European Commission should also use these or similar models to identify metrics that identify the
growth and impact of open source technologies on market viability, growth, community wellbeing, local
economic resilience, and sustainable resource use.

For example, using this ecosystem mapping model, it is easier for open source technologies to identify
future opportunities in:
    ââ Building open source solutions for secure research environment platforms within the European
        Health Data Space Health Data Access Bodies infrastructure14
    ââ Aligning with the emerging global UN Transparency Protocol15 when building open source
        technologies to meet Digital Product Passport needs, or
    ââ When building data collection instruments that align with the European Union Deforestation
        Regulation (a role that GIZ and the International Trade Centre16 have had to take on to address this
        gap)17.

The European Commission could also support European-based open source to partner and work with
European cloud providers by providing incentives or tax rebates of some kind (discussed below under
financial issues as well). For example, potentially valuable open source software like ONLYOFFICE18,
based in Latvia and offering a mature Microsoft and Google workspace alternative uses AWS Cloud if using
their open source in the cloud. Similarly Penpot19, a Spanish-founded alternative to Figma is on AWS Cloud
if using their cloud-hosted open source option. International open source of note like Plane20, which
potentially could have a sizable European user base, at present only offers AWS Cloud as the cloud-hosted
option.

As a small business, we have had to prioritise a limited suite of self-hosted open source options and opt for
cloud-hosted open source to reduce our developer workload, but that means we are back on US big tech
as an infrastructure layer. The German-based OpenProject open source software provides an option for
users to select between the French cloud provider Scaleway and AWS if choosing the cloud-hosted option.
Open source software offering cloud-hosted should be provided a rebate or tax incentive if supporting
European-cloud options to their users.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private
sectors? Please provide concrete examples, including the factors (such
as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation, among others) that are most
important to assess the added value.

Some of the added values of open source technologies that we are aware of includes:
  ââ Sense of purpose and contribution for businesses such as mine in using open source and
      contributing to maintaining open source projects
  ââ Faster product development as we are able to draw on open source frameworks, standards and
      tools to speed up our own products and service delivery (as we have done with using Strapi as our
      CMS for example)
  ââ Better sustainability of IT, as we are using open source that has been developed and refined by
      multiple contributors, and instead of then resulting in bloated code that takes more compute and
      energy resources, we understand that we are able to use technologies that are widely often
      considered to have up to 4X performance advantages

   The EUDR also demonstrates how an open digital ecosystem approach could be more than just open source technologies: the
initial regulatory data that needs to be collected could be released as an open data model which could then have been used by all
stakeholders and used to support open source data collection and reporting technologies. Instead the sector is already fragmented
with proprietary and open source solutions each creating their own non-interoperable data model to collect the same data points.)

     ââ Faster professional development and skills growth for our team members as they can see the code
        and understand from others how to build solutions for specific use cases.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to
support the development and growth of the EU open-source sector and
contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and cybersecurity
agenda?

There is insufficient training, resources and support to adopt a systems-thinking approach to open digital
ecosystems in this manner. There are also financial disincentives.

One idea could be to extend the role of digital business hubs in each Member State and European city to
develop this expertise. For example, in Barcelona we have BCN Activa21 to support startups that could
extend to include expertise on open source business models and community building. Alternatively
establishing a network of open source resource hubs across Europe could be developed. It is
recommended that these hubs include some co-working spaces, as many open source maintainers are
working in isolation and face significant risk of burn out because of the isolating, under-appreciated nature
of their contributions.

A body like the European DigitalSME Association22 could be encouraged to develop an open source
mentoring and support program.

One of the biggest needs in this area is for business models expertise23. Open source should not mean
free. There are several business models that are used by open source technologies including:
    ââ Enterprise pricing to provide the open source technology with 24/7 support options and input into
        feature development
    ââ Free open source community editions for self-hosting and paid cloud hosting options
    ââ Tiered pricing that provides a basic open source functionality vs premium paid options with
        additional features
    ââ Paid complementary tools, support packages, templates, and other digital products and services to
        users
    ââ Sponsorship and donations.

However, there are limited supports available to open source entrepreneurs to understand the potential and
suitability of each of these business models for use in Europe, in their member state, or for their industry
segment.

In Spain, for example, there is no recognised legal or taxation structure that understands open source. So
are donations/sponsorship for a free service calculated as income? Even though a product is being
provided for free to Spanish businesses that then use the software to generate economic opportunities?
What if there is a free level of service provided by an open source company to its clients, but the client pays
for a premium service? There is no deductible for the contribution to the economy from the open source
basic layer. This can create challenges in Spain for funding recipients to European Commission open
source grants: how do recipients accept the grant as a contribution to the open source and not as personal
income?

Businesses adopting open source, particularly European-built open source, should be eligible for a reduced
tax rate if they show a contribution to the open source they are using. For example, we understand there
are Spanish-based open source technologies that are widely used across Europe, for example, in Irish
universities, but without any financial incentives, they make no contribution. This is in contrast to US-based
businesses that recognise the value and importance of the open source technology to their value chain,
and contribute sponsorship monies to European open source initiatives (which then have to be declared
annually as personal income as there is no other way to receive these payments, and then get taxed at the
full rate for the income). Approaches such as those outlined in the EuroStackâs Buy European initiative
could be applied to open source24.

We believe the new 28th regime being proposed25 should define an open source technology option that
adequately describes taxable components and non-taxable/deductible components that businesses
operating across Europe could apply. To ensure that this was not âgamedâ perhaps those applying for this
organisational status would have to achieve digital public goods status, or only those open source
technologies that apply a specific, approved open source licence or have a specific size community can
apply for recognition for tax or financial incentives.

Expertise and support in fostering a community of maintainers and contributors is also needed for open
source technology creators.

We also hear of large enterprise sectors such as education feeling cautious about implementing open
source technologies, however, this appears as an individual choice, as many did not have a problem
suddenly integrating US AI providers into their education models. This also appears to have happened in
digital health sectors where adoption of US AI tech, especially OpenAI, appears to have been done outside
any transparent procurement processes. The European Commission should seek to provide incentives and
supports, in some of the ways described throughout this response, to support industry stakeholders to
adopt open source technologies. Assistance with compliance, audit, and security review may need to be
provided to overcome obstacles in some sectors.

Recently, there have also been a number of scams that affect the reputation and community of open source
providers. There are instances in Europe where a crypto âmemecoinâ has been created using the name and
logo of an open source software26 with explanations given that this would support the open source
creator/maintainer, but created in fact by someone not attached in any way to the community or technology.
These scams target the open source community of contributors and adopters. Open source technology
creators are then stuck in a difficult situation: they need to alert their users that this is not an official financial
mechanism, but also want to avoid promoting the memecoin in case it creates a Streisand Effect27.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
Browsers and other agents28 and the infrastructure layer29, especially cloud service providers, need to be
supported to achieve real autonomy and digital sovereignty for Europe.

European-focused open source AI components could also be prioritised as this is an area where significant
enterprise investment is focused at present and as a result, US tech options are being embedded into
European infrastructure, creating cybersecurity, data sovereignty and production risks.

More importantly Europe needs to ensure it has options to offer digital alternatives to AI. AI has not yet
proven itself to be evidence-based for much of the intended use cases currently being implemented
globally, has limited data on its true benefits and accuracy, can be energy-intensive and may not prove to
be sustainable or affordable in the mid-term. Having open source digital technologies that were not reliant
on AI is an important resilience and future competitiveness factor for Europe

We also believe Article 6 of the Copyright Act should be repealed across Europe to ensure a level playing
field for European tech including open source technologies30.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to
increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
We believe the following sectors should be prioritised for both competitiveness and as critical sectors
requiring priority focus and support.
Banking and finance: In particular, open source opportunities for payments and identity rails should be
encouraged to support the continued roll out of Third Payment Services Directive31, Digital Wallets32 and
Instant Payments regulations. European based AI will also be vitally important here with the current rapid
adoption of agentic commerce and growing interest in stablecoins requiring European open source
alternatives to be developed rapidly.
Digital health: In particular, technologies that can support the European Health Data Space initiatives33
and that can overcome the current non-transparent adoption of US-based AI in healthcare should be
prioritised. More global pandemic open source tools like Epiverse34 will also be needed in future, especially
those that address climate health impacts.
Traceability of supply chains: To align with the work of the UN Transparency Protocol35, the growing
global book and claim and carbon market sectors, and Digital Product Passport agenda36, there are multiple
opportunities for open source technologies to develop new technologies for this emerging sector.
Agrifood: To accelerate the work of FIWARE37 and the Agrifood Data Space38, new open source
technologies at scale are needed to ensure resilience and farmer and producer economic stability.

This response has been prepared by Mark Boyd, Director/Founder of Platformable, following industry consultation and feedback
and based on previous work focused on supporting open digital ecosystems in which everyone can participate and co-create their
own value.
