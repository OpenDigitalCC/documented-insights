Response to the European Open Digital Ecosystems
call for evidence by KDE e.V.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source
sector? What are the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and
maintenance of high-quality and secure open source; and (ii)
sustainable contributions to open-source communities?
  Â·   Strength:
          o There is a strong culture of volunteering across many EU countries, supported by
             a strong social safety net and a keen interest in working for the public good.
          o Across Europe we see a rich tradition of open source. The best open source
             solutions used around the world are largely developed in Europe. We can find
             undeniable success across many different industries and sectors.
          o Open Source software has proven to be an efficient use of resources due to its
             high reusability:
                 î¯ The pooling of resources that open source allows benefits all actors and
                     makes the solutions cheaper for the general public.
                 î¯ World-class open source software has been developed by small teams
                     with small budgets.
                 î¯ Solutions once developed can be reused by other players without having
                     to redevelop the same solution. Instead they can improve the existing
                     solution and extend it to fit their needs.
          o There is a focus on building long-term sustainable solutions in the Open Source
             community rather than sways in the market.
          o The European Union has a well-educated population able to make high-quality
             contributions.
          o Open Source forms a vital part of the technology supply chain for European
             technology and industry companies, used both within the products and during the
             research & development process.
  Â·   Weaknesses:
          o There is a proven record of lobbying influence by large corporations working
             against the public interest and Open Source.
          o Recognition and awareness of excellent existing open source solutions is lacking.
          o Open Source solutions often have to compete against corporations with vastly
             greater financial resources, making it harder to deliver at the same speed and
             scale.
         o   Personal circumstances of potential contributors sometimes prevent them from
             contributing (care-work, financial needs, ...).
         o   Europe lacks a hardware ecosystem, which means we have to coordinate with
             manufacturers who are elsewhere with wants and needs that do not necessarily
             align with ours.
         o   Political willpower sways depending on current trends rather than the long term
             needs.
         o   Adoption of an Open Source solution often does not result in financial
             investments, especially by institutional and corporate players. This leads to a
             situations where the creators of the technology do not have enough resources to
             maintain it sustainably. In effect, links in the technology supply chain are relied on
             and taken for granted, but can be weak in reality.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private
sectors? Please provide concrete examples, including the factors
(such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation, among others) that
are most important to assess the added value.
  Â·   Transparency, which increases security
  Â·   Ability to switch solutions and providers to avoid vendor lock-in
  Â·   Real ownership over the solution and the knowledge that surrounds it. Adoption does not
      submit the user to the will of the provider.
  Â·   Real collaboration is possible between different groups. People with different interests
      can collaborate to make good solutions for eveyone.
  Â·   The largest tech companies are in the USA and the profits they generate in the EU (by
      customers and public institutions) currently go to the USA instead of supporting the
      economy of the EU. This could be changed with the use of open source software.
  Â·   Acceleration of product and service development starting from a common, shared
      resource base.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to
support the development and growth of the EU open-source sector
and contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and cybersecurity
agenda?
  Â·   Wide adoption of solutions created within the EU, especially Open Source solutions.
  Â·   Creation of a EU Souvereign Tech Fund to support the maintainance of critical
      infrastructure open source software.
  Â·   Encourage other institutions to contribute back to Open Source projects (financially or
      otherwise) when they adopt and use them.
  Â·   Proper legal and financial consequences when the lack of usage of Open Source has
      negative consequences. These negative consequences include solutions going out of
      support, security issues and bugs that cannot be addressed due to lack of access,
      security breaches that cannot be scrutinised and more.
  Â·   Regulate processes for when hardware used in the EU is no longer supported by its
      vendor. Mandate that the software it relies on is published under an open source license.
  Â·   Focus education on transmitting foundational technology skills. Train people with
      souvereign solutions (e.g. do not focus on teaching them how to use a specific product
      but rather how to solve the underlying problem with the program as a tool to achieve it).

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
  Â·   Consumer technology because it affects the wider population.
  Â·   Technology used in public administrations because it is vital for resilience and
      sovereignty.
  Â·   We did notice that AI was mentioned throughout the document several times in places
      that surprised us. It is important to us that regulators do not get seduced by the latest
      trends but rather that they understand we are establishing long term foundations.

5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to
increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
  Â·   Public administration: Governments would be less dependant on non-EU tech
      companies and have more ownership and transparency over the deployed solutions. In
      addition the data they hold would not leave the EU.
  Â·   Education: The EU needs to train people on open source technology early so they are
      not locked into non-sovereign solutions long-term.
  Â·   Consumer technology: The technology EU citizens use every day (browsers, desktops,
      messaging applications, ...) should have viable and attractive Open Source solutions.
      This will make it less likely for them to be exposed to bad actors taking them over and
      the financial interests of the companies operating them, which will not align with the best
      interests of the EU public.
  Â·   Social media: Public opinion and news consumtions these days is largely shaped by
      social media. It needs to be owned and operated on open source solutions by public-
      interest organisations in order to work for the benefit of citizens.
  Â·   Industry: The shared technology base provided by Open Source forms a critical part of
      the supply chain used in technology products developed and exported from Europe.
      Unlike usually foreign-originated proprietary technology it is not subject to trade
      restrictions and tariffs and instead offers guaranteed availability. As a result industry
      retains the ability to develop, improve, manufacture and offer products and services in
      uncertain political climates.
