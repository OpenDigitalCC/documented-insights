Leveraging Open Source for
an Open Digital Ecosystem
Initial position
Open source is a key enabler for Europeâs digital sovereignty, competitiveness, and
cybersecurity. To be effective, EU policy must strengthen Europeâs capacity to sustain,
govern, and adopt open technologies as part of a global ecosystem, addressing existing
barriers in funding, procurement, maintenance, and market integration.

Bitkom rating
The initiative correctly identifies open source as a strategic asset for Europeâs digital
future. Further clarification is needed on how EU measures will support long-term
sustainability, value creation, and market uptake, while avoiding fragmentation and
preserving technology neutrality and global openness.

Key takeaways
ï¡ Foster value creation and capture

   While Europe is strong in open source development, value capture often occurs
   outside the EU. EU action should therefore focus on market integration and uptake,
   as well as the structural support of open source business models.

ï¡ Foster sustainable maintenance and security

   Critical open source projects depend on consistent maintenance. EU action should
   therefore focus on sustainable funding and strong market integration to support
   long-term project activities and maintenance.

ï¡ Reduce adoption barriers through funding and procurement reform

   Lifecycle-based procurement, outcome-oriented funding, and a strategic focus on
   existing solutions where available are essential to overcome adoption barriers and
   enable scalable deployment across public and private sectors.

ï¡ Strengthen Europeâs role in global open source ecosystems

   EU measures should incentivize upstream contribution, private-sector engagement,
   and interoperability, ensuring that European actors can actively shape and benefit
   from global open source ecosystems without fragmentation.

                                                                                            2

1                          The European Open Source
                           Sector
Open source software can serve as a strategic lever for strengthening Europeâs digital
sovereignty. However, digital sovereignty should not be understood as a narrow or
protectionist concept equating to a âBuy Europeanâ approach. Rather, it must be
grounded in Europeâs ability to act confidently and sustainably within global digital
ecosystems.

A European strategy on open digital ecosystems should therefore treat open source not
primarily as a European asset to be isolated, but as a global commons in which Europe
must actively invest, contribute, and lead. Open source is inherently borderless and
depends on globally distributed communities. EU measures should explicitly safeguard
the global openness of its ecosystem and avoid isolationist or fragmenting approaches
that could weaken existing international communities and undermine resilience and
security.

The core strategic challenge lies less in creating alternatives in isolation and more in
strengthening Europeâs long-term capacity to sustain, govern, and rely on open
technologies. When applied strategically, the open source model enables the efficient
use of developer resources, fosters collaboration between European companies and
global communities, and preserves competition within compliant markets. If focused
on technology-neutral and objective requirements, interoperability, and measurable
outcomes, a dedicated EU Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy can strengthen innovation
capacity, skills, and capabilities across the European digital sector.

Key Strengths of the EU Open Source Ecosystem
The European Union benefits from a deep integration of its developers, companies, and
public actors into global open source ecosystems and communities. European
contributors play an active role across a wide range of widely used projects and
foundations, giving the EU significant influence within international open source
development processes.

In addition, Europe has developed strong competencies in sector-specific applications
of open source software, particularly in areas such as logistics, automotive, and
industrial systems. These strengths are complemented by a broad and diverse
landscape of competent communities, small and medium-sized enterprises, and larger
companies that successfully build and maintain open source solutions.

Open source technologies play a crucial role by enabling EU companies to collaborate
on the foundational, non-differentiating layers of digital infrastructure and the
implementation of common standards. This collaborative approach drives progress and
efficiency across the EU industry, while safeguarding essential competition within the
market.

                                                                                           4
Leveraging Open Source for an Open Digital Ecosystem

Key Weaknesses of the EU Open Source Ecosystem
Despite these strengths, structural weaknesses persist. While a considerable share of
open source software is developed within the EU, economic value creation and
commercialization often occur outside Europe. As a result, the EU remains strong in
development capabilities but comparatively weaker in capturing value and scaling
successful solutions.

Furthermore, there are general reservations among European businesses to take on an
active and sustained role in open source ecosystems, particularly with regard to
upstream contribution and governance.

Although the strategic importance of open source is increasingly recognized at the
political level, the EU still lacks a cohesive and operational strategy with clear priorities,
practical objectives, and measurable KPIs. At the same time, collective investment in
digital commons remains insufficient, especially with regard to foundational open
source components that underpin Europeâs digital infrastructure.

Barriers to Adoption and Maintenance
One of the most significant barriers to adoption lies in prevailing procurement and
cost-evaluation practices. In both public and private sectors, procurement decisions
frequently prioritize initial acquisition costs over comprehensive lifecycle evaluations.
This approach often fails to account for long-term factors such as maintenance,
security updates, support, and transition costs, thereby disadvantaging solutions that
may offer more predictable and sustainable total cost of ownership.

In addition, deficiencies in market visibility and organization limit the uptake of open
source solutions. A lack of transparency regarding available offerings and their
capabilities reduces market awareness and makes it difficult for potential users to
identify suitable solutions, particularly when compared to well-resourced proprietary
vendors with established sales and marketing structures.

Regulatory fragmentation across Member States further complicates adoption.
Heterogeneous legal and regulatory frameworks and insufficient harmonization create
uncertainty for organizations seeking to deploy and scale open source solutions across
borders. Additionally, initiatives developing partially redundant solutions (e.g. office
software) across the EU complicate adoption and maintenance.

Barriers to sustainable contribution
Sustainable contribution to open source ecosystems is often hindered by a short-term
focus on development cost savings and a limited appreciation of the long-term value of
engagement. Incentives for sustained upstream contribution remain weak, both in
public funding schemes and in corporate strategies.

These challenges are compounded by an overestimation of legal, intellectual property,
and liability risks associated with open source contribution, affecting both individuals
and companies.

                                                                                                 5
Leveraging Open Source for an Open Digital Ecosystem

In addition, the adoption of open source software stacks to sector-specific use cases
frequently lacks sustained support, as existing funding models tend to focus on
horizontal technologies and do not adequately address specific sectoral needs.

Public funding instruments often prioritize new projects, prototypes, and innovation
phases, while long-term maintenance, security and operational support remain
underfunded. This imbalance undermines the sustainability of widely used open source
components that form part of critical digital infrastructure.

2                         The Added Value of Open Source
From a strategic perspective, open source software contributes significantly to
resilience and digital sovereignty. By mitigating vendor lock-in and enabling
transparency, auditability, and verifiability, open source strengthens long-term
reliability and trustworthiness, particularly in critical and high-dependency sectors.

Open source also supports more efficient cost allocation and scalability. Shared
investment in foundational technologies allows organizations and public
administrations to reduce duplication of effort and allocate resources more effectively
across ecosystems and Member States.

In terms of innovation, open source accelerates time-to-market by enabling reuse,
modular development, and collaboration across organizational boundaries. This allows
companies and public actors to focus investments on differentiating features and core
business innovation rather than rebuilding basic infrastructure.

At the same time, open source fosters market development and enables new European
business models built around services, integration, customization, and long-term
support. Enhanced interoperability and data portability further strengthen competitive
and open markets within the EU.

In addition, the open source ecosystem serves as a vital commons for education,
lifelong learning, and upskilling. EU companies and the EU public sector benefit from
the practical training and hands-on experience that open source provides to future
employees, while also supporting the continuous development of skills and expertise
among their existing workforce. This ongoing engagement with open source
strengthens the overall talent pool and enhances digital competencies across the
European economy.

                                                                                          6

3                         Measures and Actions
EU action should focus on strengthening the conditions under which open source
software can be sustainably developed and maintained, governed, and adopted at
scale. Priority should be given to long-term maintenance, upstream contribution,
market integration, and the avoidance of fragmentation, rather than to the parallel
development of isolated or duplicative solutions.

Sustain and Secure Critical Open Source Infrastructure
Funding and policy instruments at the EU level should systematically include sector-
specific open source initiatives alongside generic digital infrastructure and generally
aim to strengthen cooperation on security best practices. A European Sovereign Tech
Fund should be established to sustain and secure critical open source technologies,
with a clear focus on long-term maintenance, security, and resilience rather than short-
term project funding.

In parallel, structured stewardship models such as EU open source maintenance
cooperatives should be supported to ensure the reliable operation and continuous
evolution of widely used components. The EU should also formally recognize and
support Software Heritage, or comparable initiatives, as shared and reliable
repositories for critical open source components, based on stable public-private
partnership models for funding. Where necessary to ensure continuity and security,
strategic patronage mechanisms for critical open source projects should be
implemented. These mechanisms should generally avoid unnecessary fragmentation
of existing ecosystems. Thus, the commission should initiate a structured dialogue
with global open source software foundations.

Align Public Funding with Open Source Outcomes
Public funding mechanisms should be adapted to better support outcome-oriented
and agile open source development. This requires shifting KPIs away from research-
centric metrics toward measurable impact, reuse, adoption, and long-term
sustainability. The goal should be to foster unbiased funding practices that evaluate
potential solutions equally, based on objective requirements and case-based criteria.

Enable Market Uptake through Procurement and
Standards
Public procurement represents a key lever for scaling open source in Europe and should
be adapted accordingly. Procurement procedures should place greater emphasis on
lifecycle-based evaluation rather than acquisition cost, focus on existing solutions
where available in âMake or Buyâ decisions, and should explicitly include
interoperability and avoidance of vendor lock-in as core criteria. In addition, tenders
should recognize and reward the active participation of suppliers in upstream open
source development of the solutions they provide.

                                                                                           7
Leveraging Open Source for an Open Digital Ecosystem

EU-level and national procurement rules should be systematically reviewed to identify
and eliminate any unintended discrimination against open source solutions and
components. This includes reassessing preferences for offers with formal commercial
support from vendors, ensuring that open source solutions with comparable informal
support practices are equally considered. Tools such as the OpenSSF Scorecard can be
employed to evaluate the maturity and reliability of open source projects, enabling fair
and transparent comparison with proprietary alternatives.

The establishment and support of open source reference implementations for existing
standards can further facilitate adoption and interoperability across sectors.

Create Incentives for Private-Sector Contribution
To strengthen Europeâs role within global open source ecosystems, private-sector
engagement must be actively encouraged. Targeted tax incentives and/or subsidies
similar to established incentives for internal R&D efforts should be introduced to
encourage sustained engagement by European businesses and to lower barriers to
long-term contribution.

The EU has a significant opportunity to strengthen the acceptance of open source
within the EU business culture. However, EU companies often remain risk-averse in
adopting open source, influenced by factors such as intra-EU taxation rules â including
and especially transfer pricing of multi-national development activities â and
inconsistencies in national legislation on issues like intellectual property rights and
liability exclusions. Additionally, the introduction of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) may
have unintentionally increased uncertainty and hesitation, which should be proactively
addressed to encourage broader open source adoption.

4                         Key Technologies and Sectors
Technologies to be prioritized
Priority should be given to cross-sectoral software stack elements such as operating
systems, databases, middleware, common data models and APIs, as well as to core
digital platformsâwhich often carry a high risk of proprietary vendor lock-in.
Furthermore, broad-use and high-sensitivity applications including office solutions,
communications, IoT, and security software should be prioritized. Core internet
protocols and advanced authentication technologies should also be considered
strategic priorities.

Beyond horizontal technologies such as cloud, AI, and cybersecurity, particular
attention should be paid to sector-specific open source stacks in areas where Europe
has strong regulatory responsibility and long system lifecycles.

                                                                                             8

Sectors in which Open Source enhances
Competitiveness and Resilience
Increased use of open source software would be particularly beneficial in sectors such
as transport, energy, public administration, cybersecurity, and industrial systems,
where shared open foundations directly strengthen cyber resilience, interoperability,
and long-term competitiveness.

Semiconductor and hardware engineering, including microprocessors and IP blocks,
also represent areas in which open approaches can contribute to strategic resilience
and Europeâs innovation capacity.

                                                                                         9
