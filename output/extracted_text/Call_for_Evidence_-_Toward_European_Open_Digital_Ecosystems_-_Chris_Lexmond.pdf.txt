Executive summary
This response is submitted by an independent open-source practitioner with experience
founding and leading a company active in open-source software development, maintenance,
and consulting. The observations below are based on hands-on experience working with
open-source projects, contributors, and adopters across both EU/EMEA and US contexts.

The response focuses in particular on structural barriers affecting the sustainability of the EU
open-source ecosystem, including incentive misalignment for long-term maintenance,
supply-chain security, and dependency on non-EU collaboration infrastructure. It aims to provide
practical, experience-based input to inform the Commissionâs approach to strengthening
European open digital ecosystems.
1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source
sector? What are the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and
maintenance of high-quality and secure open source; and (ii)
sustainable contributions to open-source communities?
The EU has a large, skilled, and active open-source software (OSS) community, with strong
technical expertise and a long tradition of collaboration. OSS is deeply embedded across the
European digital economy, including in public administration, critical infrastructure, and industrial
systems. In many domains, EU-based developers and projects are globally influential, and the
values commonly associated with OSS, openness, transparency, and collaboration, are broadly
aligned with European digital principles.

Despite these strengths, there are several structural weaknesses that limit the EU OSS sectorâs
ability to scale, remain sustainable, and fully realize its potential.

A key weakness is the ecosystemâs heavy dependence on a small number of non-EU platforms
for collaboration and distribution, most notably GitHub. While these platforms function well
technically and are widely adopted, this concentration creates a single point of dependency at
the core coordination layer of OSS development. Governance, access, and long-term
availability are largely outside EU influence, reducing resilience and creating systemic risk for a
sector that underpins much of the digital economy.

Another major barrier relates to security and maintenance. OSS supply-chain attacks have
become increasingly common, while many organizations integrate dependency updates rapidly
due to delivery pressure and limited resources. Individual projects and maintainers often lack
the capacity to monitor ecosystem-wide risks or respond to coordinated threats. This makes the
adoption and long-term maintenance of high-quality and secure OSS more difficult, particularly
for smaller teams and projects.

There is also a persistent gap between technical development and sustainable adoption. Many
OSS projects begin as engineer-driven initiatives, but lack the resources or expertise required
for productization, documentation, governance, user support, and long-term maintenance. As a
result, promising projects often struggle to achieve sustained adoption or decline once initial
development funding ends. This directly affects both the sustainability of contributions to OSS
communities and the willingness of public and private organizations to rely on these projects in
production environments.

Underlying many of these issues is a structural incentive problem. In practice, contribution to
OSS projects is often motivated by indirect benefits such as skills development, reputation
building, or increased employability. While these incentives can be effective in early stages, they
tend to diminish once contributors move to roles or employers that no longer directly benefit
from the project. As a result, projects frequently lose their most knowledgeable maintainers over
time, even when the software remains widely used. The lack of clear economic or institutional
incentives for long-term maintenance creates a systematic bias toward starting new projects
rather than sustaining existing ones, contributing to technical debt, security risk, and eventual
abandonment.

Finally, there is a growing perception among parts of the OSS developer community that policy
and enforcement signals in the EU are not always clearly aligned with core OSS values,
particularly around privacy, neutrality of tools, and developer liability. Where developers perceive
uncertainty about potential legal or personal risk associated with building and maintaining
general-purpose OSS, this can create a chilling effect on contribution. OSS communities are
especially sensitive to these risks, and over time this uncertainty can weaken the EUâs ability to
attract and retain contributors in strategically important areas such as security, cryptography,
and decentralised systems.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and
private sectors? Please provide concrete examples, including the
factors that are most important to assess the added value.
The primary added value of OSS for both the public and private sectors lies in increased control,
resilience, and flexibility over digital systems. OSS reduces dependency on single vendors,
mitigates lock-in, and enables organizations to audit, adapt, and maintain software over long
time horizons. These characteristics are particularly important for public administrations,
regulated industries, and infrastructure with long lifecycles.

For public-sector users, OSS supports transparency, auditability, and long-term continuity.
Access to source code allows systems to be reviewed, maintained, or transferred between
providers without being tied to a single vendor. This reduces strategic risk and can improve
resilience, especially where systems must remain operational for many years.

For private-sector users, OSS often enables faster innovation, access to a broader talent pool,
and greater flexibility in system design. In practice, decisions to adopt OSS are frequently driven
less by short-term cost savings and more by considerations such as control over critical
dependencies, reduced exposure to vendor lock-in, and the ability to adapt software as
business needs evolve.

Security is another important dimension of added value. OSS enables independent review and
inspection, which can improve security outcomes over time. However, this value depends on the
presence of coordinated security practices and sustained maintenance. Without adequate
support for dependency management and supply-chain risk mitigation, the theoretical security
advantages of OSS are harder to realise in practice.

Trust also plays a significant role in assessing value. OSS ecosystems depend on voluntary
contribution, shared norms, and a sense of alignment between developers, users, and
institutions. Where public and private actors view OSS as a neutral and trustworthy foundation,
supported by clear rules, predictable enforcement, and sustainable governance, both adoption
and contribution tend to increase. Conversely, uncertainty around long-term support, security
responsibilities, or developer liability can reduce participation, even where the technical value of
OSS is clear.

3. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level
to support the development and growth of the EU open-source
sector and contribute to the EUâs technological sovereignty and
cybersecurity agenda?
Based on practical experience working with OSS projects and organizations, there are several
concrete actions the EU could take that would materially improve the resilience and
sustainability of the EuropeanOSS ecosystem.

First, the EU could reduce systemic dependency on non-EU collaboration infrastructure by
supporting viable alternatives. At present, the OSS ecosystem depends almost entirely on
GitHub, a platform owned and controlled by a single non-EU company. While GitHub is widely
used and technically effective, this concentration creates a structural dependency at a critical
coordination layer of the digital ecosystem.

Rather than mandating a single replacement, the EU could support diversity and resilience at
this layer by investing in interoperable and federated OSS collaboration infrastructure. For
example, EU institutions or agencies could provide long-term, reliable hosting and operational
support for alternative models, including federated or peer-to-peer approaches. Operating
trusted hosted nodes could help bootstrap such networks, lower adoption barriers, and provide
credible, long-lived infrastructure without forcing developers to abandon existing workflows.

Second, the EU could establish or support an EU-level coordination function focused on OSS
software supply-chain security. Supply-chain attacks targeting OSS dependencies have become
a significant and growing risk, while individual projects and maintainers often lack the resources
to monitor or respond to these threats.

Such a coordination function could analyse emerging attack patterns, identify compromised or
high-risk components, and publish shared advisories or warning signals in machine-readable
formats. These could be integrated into existing registries and developer tooling on a voluntary
basis, improving security outcomes across the ecosystem without imposing heavy compliance
burdens on individual developers or projects.

Third, the EU could address the gap between OSS development, adoption, and long-term
sustainability. Many projects are technically strong but lack the resources required for
productization, documentation, governance, user support, and maintenance. As a result,
promising projects often struggle to reach production use or to remain viable once initial
development funding ends.
EU-level support mechanisms could help bridge this gap by connecting OSS communities with
companies, foundations, or consortia capable of deploying, supporting, and maintaining these
projects in real-world environments. This could include funding instruments, partnership
programmes, or procurement-adjacent mechanisms that explicitly recognise and finance
long-term maintenance and governance, not just initial development.

In this context, it is worth noting that some adjacent digital ecosystems that rely heavily on
shared, open infrastructure have experimented with alternative funding models that focus on
retroactive, impact-based support for public digital goods. These models reward projects after
they have demonstrated real-world adoption, usage, or security impact, rather than relying
solely on ex ante project proposals.

In practice, such approaches have helped support long-term maintenance and stewardship by
aligning incentives with sustained usefulness rather than visibility or novelty. While not all
aspects of these models are directly transferable, they offer useful lessons for how incentive
structures could be adapted at EU level to better support maintenance, security, and long-term
sustainability of OSS.

Taken together, these measures would strengthen the entire OSS lifecycle, from collaboration
infrastructure and development, through security and risk management, to adoption, market
integration, and long-term sustainability, while supporting the EUâs objectives around
technological sovereignty, cybersecurity, and competitiveness.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?
Priority should be given to technology areas that sit at foundational layers of the digital
ecosystem and have high cross-sector leverage.

First, collaboration and developer infrastructure should be prioritised, as these tools underpin
nearly all OSS development. Dependency at this layer affects the entire ecosystem, regardless
of sector, and resilience here has a broad multiplier effect.

Second, software supply-chain security and dependency management tooling should be
prioritised due to their systemic importance. Improvements in these areas benefit all
downstream users of OSS, including public administrations, critical infrastructure operators, and
private-sector companies.

Finally, OSS technologies that function as shared building blocks across multiple sectors, such
as middleware, developer tooling, and core infrastructure components, should receive particular
attention, as investments here tend to generate the greatest long-term impact.
5. In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to
increased competitiveness and cyber resilience?
Increased use of OSS could lead to improved competitiveness and cyber resilience in sectors
where long system lifecycles, auditability, and control over dependencies are especially
important.

The public sector is a clear example, as public administrations often operate systems over long
time horizons and benefit from reduced vendor lock-in, transparency, and the ability to change
providers without rebuilding core systems.

Regulated industries and infrastructure-heavy sectors, such as energy, transport, healthcare,
and parts of manufacturing, could also benefit significantly. In these environments, OSS can
improve resilience and adaptability, provided that adequate support for maintenance, security,
and integration with legacy systems is in place.

Across these sectors, the benefits of OSS are most likely to be realised where adoption is
paired with sustainable governance, clear security practices, and long-term support structures.
