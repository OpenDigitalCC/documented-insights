                     Response to the European Commissionâs Open Digital Ecosystems Consul-
                     tation â February 2026

ING welcomes the opportunity to provide input on how to foster open digital ecosystems in Europe,
given the importance and widespread use of open-source software, also in the banking community.
ING considers that open source delivers the most value when three parts work together:
     i.  Open code keeps the source available so it can be reviewed, fixed, and maintained over
         time,
    ii.  Open governance lets anyone contribute on technical merit, regardless of employer, na-
         tionality, or other non-technical factors, and
   iii.  Open standards and protocols make systems interoperable and replaceable.
If policies or procurement processes focus on only one or two parts, the model weakens. To support
sovereignty, resilience, and competition, the EU should design measures that reinforce all three.
The answers below follow this structure of three elements.

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector?

Code
â¢ The EU has a strong developer community,
â¢ The EU is weaker in supporting infra for code (collaboration, hosting, repositories). Platforms are
   mostly maintained, managed and hosted in the US (E.g. GitHub, Gitlab, Pipy),
â¢ EU computer sciences departments are underrepresented in global top university rankings.

Governance
â¢ The US government is a strong driving factor behind technology development. The US National
   Science Foundation and US Internet Engineering Taskforce prove that the US government rec-
   ognises the strategic value of innovation. This also applies to the billions of dollars spent by
   Federal agencies on cybersecurity contracts. The European Commission has more focus on im-
   plementation, simplification and consumer protection,
â¢ EU governance is generally less robust, compared to for example, the US. Main oversight com-
   mittees, organisations and foundations are incorporated in the US (e.g. Linux Foundation Eu-
   rope resorts under the Linux Foundation US). Most funding and contribution is also from the US,
â¢ OSS projects in Europe suffer from underinvestment and a commercialisation gap compared to
   the US,
â¢ Successful European OSS projects that are commercialised, tend to exit to US-based markets
   (Ex. Elastic, Gitlab).

Protocols
â¢ The EU is weaker, as creation and maintenance is mostly under US bodies (ANSI, IEEE, ITU, NIST,
   CISA).
â¢ The EU is stronger at adopting open standards. The US tends to develop their own standards or
   adopt/adjust open standards.

2. What are the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and se-
   cure open source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

                                                 1
Code
â¢ The supporting infra for code tends to reside in the US at commercial parties (platforms such as
   GitHub (MS)). The EU and other jurisdictions do not have the same level of supporting infra. This
   integrated infra contains a high level of sophisticated automation. The investment gap over the
   past years between the US and the EU for these cloud solutions, has increased tremendously,
â¢ For certain projects (less well-maintained ones), there are security concerns regarding long-
   term support to fix vulnerabilities,
â¢ Increasing security concerns regarding malware targeting the OSS supply chain.

Governance
â¢ Main oversight committees, organisation and funding tend to gravitate towards the US. The EU
   and other jurisdictions do not have similar committees, organisation and funding available, and
   they are hard to build given a more restrictive environment,
â¢ The EU innovation funding mechanism can fund companies that justify innovation simply by
   forking OSS projects. This fosters fragmentation of the OSS landscape, instead of focusing on
   fewer but stronger OSS projects,
â¢ A limited ability in the EU to provide professional support for critical OSS components holds back
   adaption,
â¢ EU vendors are relatively underrepresented among main partners and sponsors of OSS bodies,
   compared to US and China.

Resourcing
We consider resourcing as a category under governance and long-term sustainability of projects.
European barriers include:
â¢ Lack of incentives and resources for European maintainers. Current tax regulation makes it less
   attractive to contribute, as it could be seen as taxable value creation towards a third party,
â¢ Chronically short-staffed package repositories,
â¢ Long-term insecurity of projects to remain in the OSS ecosystem,
â¢ Lack of transparent licensing on some OSS projects.

Protocols
â¢ Standards are under heavy influence by large software vendors even if standards are open (e.g.
   Kerberos RFC4120),
â¢ Creation and maintenance mostly take place in US bodies (e.g. ANSI, IEEE, ITU, NIST, CISA).

3. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sector? Please provide con-
   crete examples including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, security, innovation)

Code
â¢ OSS source code has desirable properties such as quality, availability, reusability, transpar-
   ency, portability and robustness,
â¢ OSS code facilitates growth and hiring of talent: OSS contributors are recognised by a broad
   expert community, whereas corporate certifications foster vendor lock-in.

Governance
â¢ OSS allows the private sector to participate in the creation, steering and roadmap of projects,
â¢ OSS can reduce concentration risk and commercial leverage on oligopolistic or monopolistic
   software supply markets. OSS could thus reduce vendor lock-in into closed ecosystems and
   can increase strategic independence, both at operational and geopolitical level.

                                                 2
   Protocols
   â¢ Open protocols allow easier and more interoperable integration. They are easier to audit, pro-
      vide more flexibility, and less reliance on large vendorsâ proprietary protocols, also reducing
      vendor lock-in.

   At ING open source is used at scale. ING also provides some of its projects to the open-source com-
   munity. ING also uses technology that started as open source, and in some cases is commercially
   supported. Examples of important OSS projects that tend to be in use at banks like ING include the
   Linux kernel, Python, MariaDB (formerly MySQL), Kubernetes, GnuPG, Fail2ban, OSSEC, NGINX, So-
   narQube, YARA, Suricata, Elastic, Apache Tomcat, Jetty, Cassandra, GitLab and Backstage.

   ING integrates a considerable number of OSS libraries into its systems and applications. ING cur-
   rently tracks several million opensource libraries across the largest opensource ecosystems (e.g.
   MVN & Gradle, NPM, Nuget, Yarn, Pip).

   The worldwide benefits derived from OSS at the demand side are estimated at â¬7.5tr. This trans-
   lates into an estimated âbenefit ratioâ of 1:3.5 (meaning â¬1 spent on using OSS saves â¬3.50 of in-
   house development costs; source and source)

4. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at the EU level to support development and
   growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EU technological sovereignty and
   cyber security agenda?

   The EU needs to (a) ensure the technological sovereignty of OSS projects with strategic im-
   portance and (b) create the conditions for the secure development of such OSS projects:

   Code
   â¢ This requires EU support for security mechanisms (to protect against supply chain and integrity-
      based cyber-attacks) such as funded audits, vulnerability monitoring, and coordinated incident
      response, targeted funding (directly or via explicit scoring uplifts in broader calls) for mainte-
      nance and evolution, with the goal of building a distributed maintainer network across the Un-
      ion,
   â¢ The EU could consider identifying a subset of specific OSS projects as critical for the EU, and
      focus efforts on them, also including adjacent critical dependencies,
   â¢ For such EU-critical projects, consider providing targeted funding - directly or via explicit scoring
      uplifts in broader calls for maintenance and evolution, with the goal of building a distributed
      maintainer network across the Union,
   â¢ Like US federal agencies do, the EU could fund immediate security improvement initiatives of
      open-source repositories ecosystems (e.g. npm, pipy, mvn, crates). Funding could be consid-
      ered for critical OSS projects to create a âcommon cybersecurity tooling stackâ. Threat intel
      projects, platforms and communities could be facilitated and funded.

   Governance
   â¢ Encourage EU-wide governance structures that allow for European ecosystems of OSS pro-
      jects to organise themselves in balanced, transparent ways, allowing foundations to maintain
      an open and trusted character without concentrated representations. Participation could
      range from fully open for generic OSS projects, to more restricted for projects identified as
      critical,

                                                     3
â¢   Embed requirements in public procurement processes to consider EU OSS and â at otherwise
    similar tender results â give preference to EU OSS. Require clarity on integration of OSS in
    products purchased and showcase successful deployments by the public sector,
â¢   Encourage EU critical infrastructure providers (defence, police, telecom, energy, healthcare,
    finance, etc) to widely adopt EU OSS in their systems, as well as to contribute to their code-
    base,
â¢   Funding and support for demonstrated individual / company OSS contributors to critical pro-
    jects. Consider tax credits for work spent on contributions to specific, EU critical OSS projects,
â¢   Safeguard investments in EU stack providers based on OSS. The absence of vendor lock-in
    could be compensated by long term commitments by private & public sector users,
â¢   Foster coordination of a network of OSPOs for experience sharing,
â¢   OSS license models have varying degrees of openness and limitations, not everything is as
    open as âopen sourceâ would suggest. Evaluate the feasibility and opportunity of introducing
    an EU FOSS licensing model.

Protocols
â¢ Provide interoperable alternative protocol definitions and a certification process within the EU
   for important protocols that are currently not fully open.

5. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

Code
â¢ Cybersecurity products,
â¢ (IAM) Directory and Authentication services,
â¢ (Private cloud) Virtualization layers, on-premises hosting orchestration frameworks,
â¢ AI models and Agentic AI orchestration components,
â¢ Databases and data analytics platforms,
â¢ Platform engineering and software supply chain (e.g.CI/CD, code repositories, code testing,
    etc),
â¢ Personal productivity and office automation, including secure messaging,
We do note that technology sovereignty has many dimensions. OSS projects potentially reduce
current cloud dependencies. At the same time, these projects run on a hardware stack (on-prem-
ises), that has its own supply chain dependencies.

Governance
â¢ Package repositories infrastructure and support,
â¢ Threat intelligence exchange platforms.

Protocols
â¢ Open source that implements open or international standards in authentication, network and
   cloud technologies, in areas that currently heavily rely on proprietary protocols.
â¢ Open-source sectorial data structure standards.

There is a strong concentration of cybersecurity vendors (mainly US and Israel). Many security tools
have migrated to a cloud SaaS based delivery model which raises the risk the tool is inaccessible if
the underlying cloud becomes unavailable. The research and development of on-premises and air-
gapped security products has stalled.

The ecosystem of Authentication Directory services is highly concentrated and there is very little
choice for large organisations. Identity services are essential for operations.

                                                   4
Threat intel exchange communities and platforms have demonstrated significant success and
value. The European CERT ecosystem is very active and blends in naturally with OSS projects and
initiatives. ING is an active member of several threat exchange communities.
