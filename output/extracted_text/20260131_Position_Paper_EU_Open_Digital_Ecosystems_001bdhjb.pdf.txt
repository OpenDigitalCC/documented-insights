I. Introduction
I am pleased to submit this position paper in response to the above-mentioned initiative. The following
observations are based on more than three decades of legal practice in software and IT law, drawing on
experience with software vendors, IT service providers, and public sector clients commissioning complex IT
systems.

The initiative rightly identifies the strategic potential of open source technologies for the EU's technological
sovereignty. The following comments aim to highlight practical obstacles and propose concrete solutions
based on international best practices. A guiding principle throughout is simplicity: rules must be clear,
understandable, and efficient to be applied in practice.

This position paper primarily addresses Questions 1, 2, and 3 of the consultation:

    â¢   Question 1 (Strengths, weaknesses, and obstacles): Sections II and VâVII analyze structural
        challenges inherent in public sector open source projects, including vendor discontinuity,
        sustainability of business models, and the need for standardized acceptance procedures and
        security frameworks.

    â¢   Question 2 (Value of open source solutions with concrete examples): Sections III and IV present
        detailed examples from seven countries (Singapore, India, USA, United Kingdom, Australia, South
        Korea, Brazil) and four European models (Estonia, Italy, France, GovStack), highlighting success
        factors and measurable outcomes.

    â¢   Question 3 (Concrete measures at EU level): Sections VâXI propose specific actions, culminating in
        13 recommendations covering portal infrastructure, acceptance procedures, security standards,
        governance structures, and economic participation models.

This paper focuses on governance, legal frameworks, and institutional infrastructure rather than priority
technology areas (Question 4) or sector-specific applications (Question 5). In my experience, these
structural and governance aspects are critical success factors that are frequently overlooked in discussions
about open source adoption in the public sector.

II. Structural Challenges in Public Sector Open Source Projects

1. Vendor Discontinuity
A central structural problem lies in the lifecycle of vendor engagement. After a system is implemented, the
original developer's contractual obligation typically ends. There is no automatic obligation for further
development. EU procurement rules exacerbate this problem: above certain thresholds, a new tender is
mandatory, which frequently results in third-party vendors taking over maintenance. Even with good
documentation, the maintenance and further development of complex systems by subsequent vendors
who were not involved in the original development is difficult. This discontinuity endangers stability,
development capability, and innovation.

2. Cost Distribution and Economic Viability
Contrary to a widespread assumption, open source solutions can be more expensive in total cost
comparison when each client bears the full development cost. With proprietary standard software,
development costs are distributed across a broad customer base. The problem is that public sector clients

                                                  Page 3 of 11
                                                                                 Position Paper - European Open Digital Ecosystems

often commission individual solutions instead of using and further developing existing projects â the
proverbial 'reinventing the wheel' with every project.

3. Innovation Dynamics
In public sector open source projects, every functional enhancement requires a separate contract. With
proprietary standard software, vendors aggregate requirements from a broad customer base and
continuously integrate improvements into new versions. Competitive pressure forces them to innovate. For
specific administrative applications in the open source domain, comparable mechanisms are lacking.

4. Sustainability of Business Models
Open source providers typically operate exclusively on project-based revenue and must constantly manage
resource utilization. The permanent replaceability by competitors means price becomes the decisive
differentiator. In my observation, this makes open source providers more vulnerable to acquisitions or
insolvencies. The result is consolidation processes that reduce the number of providers, ultimately leading
to new dependencies.

5. De Facto Lock-in and Personnel Challenges
Lock-in effects also occur with open source software: instead of license dependency, there is dependency
on specific know-how, extensive customization, and complex integration services. The theoretical
advantage of portability â the source code is open after all â is considerably relativized in practice.

An underestimated obstacle is also the personnel question. Open source competence requires different
skills than managing proprietary systems. Public sector organizations have structural difficulties in
attracting and retaining appropriately qualified personnel. Without accompanying competence-building
measures, the initiative risks failing due to practical implementation hurdles.

III. International Best Practices â Learning from Global Leaders
A look beyond EU borders shows that several countries have developed successful models for managing
open source software in the public sector. These experiences should inform the EU initiative:

1. Singapore: Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)
Singapore's GovTech agency has created the Singapore Government Tech Stack, a platform providing
standardized development tools and reusable components for the entire government. 1 The triad of
'People, Platform, Practice' encompasses competence building, technical infrastructure, and binding
guidelines. Over 40 agencies are already using SGTS with more than 200 cloud-based systems. The 'Digital
Service Standard' 2 has been fully mandatory for all public digital services. Open Government Products

publishes successful products like FormSG as open source 3 â these are already being adapted by Cambodia
and Sri Lanka. 4

2. India: Digital Public Infrastructure and MOSIP
India has built three fundamental digital public infrastructures with Aadhaar, UPI, and DEPA, reaching
99.9% of the adult population. From this experience emerged MOSIP (Modular Open Source Identity
Platform) 5, a modular platform for national identity systems that has now been adopted by more than a
dozen countries worldwide 6 â including the Philippines (71 million registered citizens), Morocco, Ethiopia,
and Sri Lanka. MOSIP defines comprehensive compliance standards for hardware and software to ensure
quality and interoperability. 7

3. USA: Federal Source Code Policy and 18F
The US Federal Source Code Policy (OMB M-16-21) 8 requires federal agencies to release at least 20% of
their newly developed code as open source. The 18F unit within the General Services Administration set the
standard with a 'Default to Open' policy. 9 Particularly relevant is the mandatory three-step analysis before
any software procurement: (1) review of existing federal solutions, (2) review of commercial solutions, (3)
only then new development. 10

4. United Kingdom: Government Digital Service (GDS)
The British Government Digital Service has created the 'Service Standard', a comprehensive quality
framework defining 14 principles for developing digital services. 11 A core principle states: 'Make all new
source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences.' The GDS approach is now being
exported internationally â including to Cyprus. 12 Critical is the assurance system: digital projects must pass
mandatory assessments at various phases (Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live).

5. Australia: Digital Transformation Agency (DTA)
Since January 2025, Australia has introduced the Digital Experience Policy, a comprehensive framework
comprising four standards: Digital Service Standard, Digital Inclusion Standard, Digital Access Standard, and
Digital Performance Standard. 13 The Investment Oversight Framework (IOF) ensures all digital investments

are monitored throughout their lifecycle. Notable is the Assurance Framework, which prescribes 'fit-for-
purpose' reviews. 14

6. South Korea: NIPA and Open Up
South Korea promotes open source through the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA) and its
'Open Up' center. 15 The Software Promotion Act of 2020 and the OSS Activation Policy of 2014 form the
legal framework. South Korea's 'Digital Platform Government' initiative opens APIs of public services to
private providers, creating public-private synergy. 16

7. Brazil: Portal do Software PÃºblico Brasileiro
Since 2007, Brazil has operated the Portal do Software PÃºblico Brasileiro, through which agencies can share
and jointly develop open source software. 17 Normative Instruction N.1 requires procurement officers to
primarily consider available open source solutions in feasibility analyses and to justify the use of proprietary
software. 18

IV. European Models for Central Software Management

1. Estonia: X-Road and NIIS
Estonia has developed X-Road, an open source infrastructure for secure data exchange that has now been
adapted by over 20 countries. 19 Since 2021, the public release of state-commissioned software has been
legally required. The Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) enables joint development by
Estonia, Finland, and Iceland. 20 Estonia saves over 1,345 working years annually through X-Road.

2. Italy: Developers Italia
Italy has created a binding framework with Developers Italia: every software developed by public
administration must be published in a public repository under an open source license. 21 The standardized
metadata descriptor publiccode.yml enables automatic cataloguing. Before procuring new software,
agencies must conduct a comparative assessment that favors open source solutions and reuse.

3. France: code.gouv.fr and DINUM
France operates code.gouv.fr, a platform that inventories all source code repositories of public
organizations. 22 The 'Socle InterministÃ©riel de Logiciels Libres' (SILL) is a curated list of recommended open
source software. The BlueHats community connects developers and public servants. In 2024, France
became the first country to officially endorse the UN Open Source Principles. 23

4. GovStack Initiative
The GovStack Initiative, supported by GIZ (German Agency for International Cooperation), ITU
(International Telecommunication Union), and Estonia among others, develops reusable 'Building Blocks' â
standardized software components for typical administrative tasks such as identity management, payment
processing, and messaging. 24 Governments can combine these building blocks and adapt them to local
needs instead of developing each solution from scratch.

V. Standardized Acceptance Procedures with Certified Auditors
A central deficit of the initiative lies in the absence of standardized acceptance procedures. When public
sector clients commission software development or obtain software from a central portal, quality,
compliance, and documentation must be ensured through a binding review procedure. The rules must be
simple, understandable, and efficient to ensure their practical application.

1. Tiered Review Categories by Criticality
Following the Singapore and Australian models, a tiered system should be introduced: standard
applications undergo basic review (automated code analysis, license check, documentation check). Critical
infrastructure software requires extended reviews (penetration tests, independent code audits, compliance
certification). Security-critical systems require full certification according to EU-recognized standards.

2. Certified Review Organizations
The EU should establish an accreditation system for review organizations, comparable to ISO certification
bodies or BSI (German Federal Office for Information Security) auditors for IT baseline protection. These
auditors must demonstrably have expertise in open source licenses, IT security, data protection, and public
law. An EU-wide register of accredited auditors would create transparency and comparability.

3. Review Catalog with Clear, Measurable Criteria
The review catalog should cover the following areas, each with simple yes/no criteria and quantifiable
thresholds:
(a) Functional Quality: Test coverage â¥ 80%, automated test suites, documented test cases.
(b) Code Quality: Static code analysis without critical findings, compliance with coding standards.
(c) Security: Software Bill of Materials present, no known critical CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures) in dependencies, security scan passed.

(d) Compliance: License compatibility verified, GDPR requirements met, accessibility per EN 301 549.
(e) Documentation: Installation guide, API documentation, operations manual, architecture overview
present and current.

4. Transparent Certification Levels
Software in the EU portal should be marked with clear certification levels: 'Reviewed' (basic requirements
met), 'Recommended' (extended review passed, actively maintained), 'Production-ready for Critical
Infrastructure' (full certification). Using agencies can thus assess the risk and document their decision.

5. Efficiency Principle: Automation and Standardization
To avoid bureaucracy, the review procedure should be largely automated: CI/CD integration for continuous
testing, standardized checklists in digital form, automated Software Bill of Materials generation and
vulnerability scans. Manual review occurs only for aspects that cannot be automated. The target should be
a review duration of maximum 10 working days for standard applications.

VI. IT Security and Software Supply Chain

1. Protection Against Malicious Code Contributions
The XZ-Utils incident of 2024 demonstrated how trust can be built over years to place a backdoor in widely-
used infrastructure software. For security-critical applications, strict contributor vetting processes must be
established. The USA has already created a legal framework with the Securing Open Source Software Act,
which tasks CISA (U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) with developing an assessment
framework. 25

2. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
The Cyber Resilience Act already requires SBOMs. The German BSI has formulated detailed requirements
with TR-03183-2. 26 NIST 27 (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology), CISA (U.S. Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency), and international standards (SPDX, CycloneDX) are converging toward
a common framework. 28 For EU portal software, SBOMs should be mandatory and machine-readable to
enable automated vulnerability detection.

3. Responsibility for Security Updates
For every software provided in the EU portal, a responsible maintainer must be named who commits to
timely provision of security updates. Minimum requirements for response times should be defined (e.g., 72

hours for critical vulnerabilities). This corresponds to the governance structure of successful projects like X-
Road.

VII. Compliance, Liability, and Responsibilities
When an agency downloads an open source application from a central portal assuming it is compliant â but
it is not â the question of responsibility arises. The initiative must provide clear regulations:

(a) Responsibility of the developing agency for initial compliance at the time of publication.
(b) Responsibility of the portal operator for conducting the review and release procedure.
(c) Responsibility of the using agency for proper integration and operation.
(d) Liability limitations following the model of existing EU regulations (e.g., CRA exceptions for non-
commercial open source development).

VIII. Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) as Institutional Infrastructure
The establishment of OSPOs has proven internationally to be an effective governance model. 29 The
European Commission itself established an OSPO in 2020. France operates a national OSPO, and cities like
Paris and Bratislava have established municipal OSPOs. 30 The initiative should actively promote the
establishment of OSPOs at all levels â EU, national, regional, municipal â and strengthen the European
OSPO network.

IX. Economic Participation of Developing Companies
The question of how companies can participate in the success of publicly funded software is crucial for
ecosystem sustainability. Without economic incentives, companies will not invest their best resources in
public projects. Possible approaches include:

(a) Maintenance Framework Contracts: Developing companies could be preferentially commissioned for
maintenance services without requiring a new tender for each engagement.
(b) Usage-based Compensation: Similar to collecting societies, usage reports could be aggregated and
distributed proportionally to developers.
(c) Right of First Refusal: For further development, the original developer receives a right of first refusal.

X. Plea for a Technology-Neutral Sovereignty Strategy
The declared goal of the initiative â technological sovereignty â is fundamentally independent of the
licensing model. European proprietary software companies can fulfill the same sovereignty goals: control
over critical technologies, value creation within the EU, independence from non-European actors.

What is decisive for technological sovereignty is not whether the source code is open, but rather:

(a) the company's headquarters within the EU,

(b) corporate control by EU citizens with nationality of a Member State as majority shareholders (at least
51%, preferably 75%),
(c) actual control over development, operation, and further development within the EU, and
(d) the absence of corporate structures that enable control by third countries.

The Commission should examine whether the initiative should be expanded to include a parallel support
component for proprietary European software companies that meet these strict requirements. Such an
expansion would not contradict the open source strategy but would be its meaningful complement in
service of the overarching goal.

XI. Summary of Recommendations
Based on the international best practices and identified challenges, I recommend:
(1) Establish a 'European Public Code Portal' following the Italian and French models with the
publiccode.yml standard and automated cataloguing.
(2) Mandatory three-step analysis before software procurement following the US model: (i) existing EU
solutions, (ii) commercial solutions, (iii) new development.
(3) Introduce standardized acceptance procedures with tiered review categories, clear criteria, and EU-
accredited auditors â simple, understandable, efficient.
(4) Develop an EU accreditation system for review organizations following the model of ISO certification
bodies.
(5) Mandatory Software Bill of Materials requirements and security standards for all portal software with
named maintainers.
(6) Clear regulations on compliance responsibilities and liability distribution between developing, operating,
and using entities.
(7) Promote Open Source Program Offices at EU, national, and municipal levels in all Member States.
(8) Form transnational specialist groups for typical administrative applications with coordinated
requirements gathering following the GovStack model.
(9) Develop innovative participation models so developing companies can economically share in
distribution success.
(10) Invest in competence building in the public sector following Singapore's 'People-Platform-Practice'
model.
(11) Review procurement law frameworks for long-term maintenance and development contracts.
(12) Expand to include a technology-neutral support component for proprietary European software with EU
headquarters and EU citizen control.
(13) Develop a certification framework for 'sovereign software' independent of the licensing model.

XII. Conclusion
The initiative pursues important goals. A look at international best practices shows that central software
management, standardized acceptance procedures, and clear governance structures significantly influence
success. Singapore, India, the USA, the United Kingdom, and Australia have accumulated valuable
experience with different approaches from which Europe can learn.

Decisive is the principle of simplicity: rules must be clear, understandable, and efficient to be applied in
practice. Excessive bureaucracy would endanger the initiative's success.

Technological sovereignty is ultimately not a question of the licensing model, but a question of control. A
policy that aims to ensure European control over critical software technologies should include all European
companies that can guarantee this control â regardless of whether they work with open source or
proprietary software.
