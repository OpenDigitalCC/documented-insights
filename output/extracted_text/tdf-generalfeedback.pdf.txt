                       by The Document Foundation
                 The Document Foundation â February 3, 2026
Comprehensive Analysis of EU Open Source Sector
1. Strengths, Weaknesses & Barriers
Strengths of the EU Open Source Sector
Europe hosts a highly skilled technical workforce with strong contributions to major open
source projects. European developers are significant contributors to the Linux kernel, and
European institutions have pioneered some public sector open source initiatives.
The EU benefits from a strong tradition of collaborative research and development, with
universities and research institutions contributing to open source projects. The regulatory
environment, particularly around data protection (GDPR) and digital rights, has created
opportunities for privacy-focused and user-centric open source solutions.
Weaknesses of the EU Open Source Sector
The sector is fragmented across member states. There's a shortage of large-scale,
commercially successful European open source companies compared to the US. The EU
experiences significant talent drain, with skilled developers often migrating to US-based
tech companies offering higher compensation.
Investment in open source infrastructure and maintenance is insufficient, and there's a
gap in professional services and support ecosystems around open source projects. The
EU also lags in certain emerging technology areas like cloud computing and artificial
intelligence frameworks, where US and Asian companies dominate.
Barriers to Adoption and Maintenance
Organizational and Cultural Barriers
â¢ Risk-averse procurement practices favoring established proprietary vendors
â¢ Lack of awareness among decision-makers about open source maturity and
  capabilities
â¢ Insufficient internal technical capacity to evaluate and implement open source
â¢ Concerns about liability, warranties, and support compared to commercial software
Technical and Resource Barriers
â¢ Limited availability of professional support and maintenance services for many open
  source projects
â¢ Security concerns stemming from dependency chains and also lack of comprehensive
  auditing, and integration challenges with existing proprietary systems
â¢ Skills gaps in both public and private sectors for managing open source deployments
Financial Barriers
â¢ Underestimation of total cost of ownership (migration, training, customization)
â¢ Difficulty quantifying long-term benefits versus upfront costs, especially on desktops
â¢ Procurement frameworks that don't account for open source economics (low licensing
   costs but higher service costs)
Barriers to Sustainable Contributions
Economic Sustainability
â¢ The "free rider" problem where organizations use open source without contributing
  back
â¢ Difficulty monetizing open source contributions for individual developers and small
  companies, and insufficient funding mechanisms for long-term maintenance of
  foundational projects
â¢ Lack of clear business models for maintainers of critical infrastructure projects
Structural Barriers
â¢ Reliance on volunteer labor for critical projects, leading to burnout and security
  vulnerabilities
â¢ Unclear career progression paths for developers focused on open source, and lack of
  recognition and incentives for maintenance work versus new feature development
â¢ Corporate contribution policies that restrict employee participation
Coordination Challenges
â¢ Fragmented governance across projects and foundations
â¢ Difficulty coordinating contributions across competing commercial interests
â¢ Language and cultural barriers within the EU, reducing collaboration efficiency
2. Added Value of Open Source
Public Sector Benefits
Cost Efficiency
French Gendarmerie's migration to Ubuntu and open source office suites reportedly
saved over â¬50 million while modernizing their IT infrastructure. The Italian Ministry of
Defense has similarly achieved significant savings. However, cost benefits must be
carefully calculated including migration, training, and ongoing support costs.
Digital Sovereignty and Strategic Autonomy
Open source enables governments to reduce dependency on foreign technology vendors,
which is particularly important for critical infrastructure and sensitive data. The ability to
inspect, modify, and control software is crucial for national security.
Transparency and Democratic Accountability
Open source enables citizens and oversight bodies to audit government software for
security, privacy, and correct implementation of policies. This transparency builds public
trust and enables democratic scrutiny of automated decision-making systems.
Interoperability and Vendor Neutrality
Open standards and open source facilitate cross-border digital services within the EU,
essential for the Digital Single Market. They prevent vendor lock-in and enable healthy
market competition.
Security Through Transparency
While open source has security vulnerabilities like any software, the "many eyes" principle
allows broader security review. Governments can conduct independent security audits
and don't rely solely on vendor assurances.
Private Sector Benefits
Innovation and Time-to-Market
Companies can build on existing open source components rather than reinventing the
wheel. For example, most modern web services rely on open source databases (MySQL,
PostgreSQL), web servers (Apache, Nginx), and programming languages. This dramatically
accelerates development cycles.
Talent Attraction and Retention
Developers prefer working with modern, open source technology stacks. Companies
contributing to open source gain reputational benefits and can attract top talent. RedHat
(before IBM acquisition) demonstrated that an open source business model can build a
multi-billion dollar company.
Risk Mitigation
Open source reduces risks associated with vendor bankruptcy, product discontinuation,
or forced upgrades. Companies maintain the option to fork projects or hire alternative
support providers if primary vendors fail to meet needs.
Flexibility and Customization
Organizations can modify open source software to meet their specific needs without
negotiating with vendors. This is particularly valuable in specialized industries or for
competitive differentiation.
Cost Structure
While not always cheaper in total cost of ownership, open source shifts costs from
licensing fees to implementation and support, often providing better value. Companies
pay for value-added services rather than licensing constraints.
Critical Assessment Factors
Security: Many critical open source projects are under-resourced for security auditing,
and many critical projects areunderfunded, despite the widespread dependency on open
source software.
Cost: TCO includes migration costs, training, integration, customization, and ongoing
support. These must be compared against both licensing costs and the value of avoiding
vendor lock-in.
Innovation Potential: Open source enables faster innovation through collaborative
development and building on shared foundations, but requires organizational capacity to
participate effectively.
Lock-in Avoidance: Perhaps the most strategic long-term value, for decisions that may
last decades such as those related to infrastructure, for full independence from vendors
based outside Europe, full ownership of contents through desktop applications, and for
long time archiving of documents.
3. Concrete EU-Level Measures
Institutional Framework
Establish an EU Open Source Program Office (OSPO)
Create a dedicated EU OSPO to coordinate open source strategy, provide guidance to
member states and manage funding programs. A center of excellence to develop best
practices, procurement guidelines and security standards for open source adoption
across EU institutions.
Establish an EU Code Repository and Collaboration Platform
Develop EU-hosted infrastructure for software development, reducing dependency on US-
based platforms (GitHub, GitLab cloud). This would serve public sector projects requiring
data sovereignty.
Funding Mechanisms
Critical Open Source Infrastructure Fund
Create a dedicated fund to support maintenance and security of strategic open source
projects for the EU. This addresses the chronic underfunding of foundational projects.
Maintainer Fellowship Program
Fund full-time positions for maintainers of strategic open source projects, ensuring
dedicated professional attention to security, maintenance and development.
Bug Bounty and Security Audit Programs
Establish EU-wide programs for security research and auditing of open source software
and libraries used in critical infrastructure and public services.
Policy and Regulatory Measures
Default-to-Open Policy
Mandate that software developed with public funding be released as open source (with
national security exceptions). Several member states have such policies; extending this
EU-wide would create significant momentum.
Open Source Procurement Framework
Develop procurement rules that properly evaluate open source options, accounting for
total cost of ownership, strategic benefits, and long-term value. Remove barriers that
inadvertently favor proprietary solutions.
Legal Clarity and Liability Framework
Provide clear legal guidance on liability, warranties, and contractual frameworks for open
source procurement and use. Address concerns that hamper public sector adoption.
Integration with EU Cybersecurity Regulations
Ensure the Cyber Resilience Act and other regulations support rather than burden open
source development. Create pathways for compliance that recognize open source
development models.
Public Sector Open Source Mandate
Require EU institutions and member state governments to prioritize open source where
technically feasible, with clear evaluation criteria and exemption processes.
Ecosystem Development
European OSPO Network
Create a network connecting open source program offices across public sector, research
institutions, and private companies.
Open Source Skills Development
Integrate open source development, contribution practices, and governance into digital
skills programs, university curricula, and professional training. Support internships and
contribution programs.
Recognition and Career Pathways
Recognize open source contributions in professional advancement, research evaluation,
and procurement decisions. Create clear career paths for open source specialists in
public sector.
Industry-Academic Collaboration
Fund partnerships between universities and open source projects, enabling students to
gain real-world experience while providing projects with contributor pipelines.
Strategic Initiatives
Open Source AI/ML Platform
Invest in European open source artificial intelligence and machine learning frameworks to
compete with US-dominated platforms.
Critical Technology Sovereignty Programs
Identify technology areas of strategic importance (operating systems, cryptography,
industrial control systems) and fund dedicated open source initiatives to ensure EU
capabilities.
4. Priority Technology Areas
Operating Systems, Desktop Software and Core Infrastructure
Operating systems are the foundation of digital sovereignty. Dependency on proprietary
US-based operating systems creates strategic vulnerabilities. Linux dominates servers,
but the adoption is is still weak on desktop and mobile operating systems.
Support European Linux distributions for public sector use, fund development of user-
friendly alternatives for desktop environments, invest in open source mobile operating
systems, and support hardware compatibility efforts.
Cloud and Edge Computing
Cloud infrastructure is increasingly critical for businesses and governments. Current
dominance by US providers creates significant data sovereignty concerns and strategic
dependencies. The EU has technical capability but lacks coordinated market presence.
Support open source cloud platforms, fund edge computing frameworks for IoT and
industrial applications, develop European-hosted cloud services based on open source.
Cybersecurity and Cryptography
Cybersecurity is fundamental to all digital activities and directly tied to sovereignty and
resilience. Cryptographic capabilities are particularly strategic.
Fund development and auditing of cryptographic libraries, support security scanning and
vulnerability management tools, invest in quantum-resistant cryptography research and
implementation, develop EU-based security operations platforms.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
AI is a technology where the EU risks falling behind US and Chinese organizations. Open
source frameworks could enable European companies and researchers to compete while
maintaining transparency and accountability.
Create European open source AI/ML frameworks, fund development of training datasets
respecting GDPR, support AI tooling for specific European industry needs, develop
federated learning and privacy-preserving AI technologies.
Internet of Things and Industrial Systems
The EU has strong industrial base but IoT platforms are often proprietary or dominated by
non-EU vendors. Open source industrial control systems and IoT platforms could leverage
European manufacturing excellence.
Support open source industrial automation and control systems, fund IoT platform
development with strong security and privacy, develop open source digital twin
technologies, support Industry 4.0 open source initiatives.
Digital Identity and Authentication
Digital identity is foundational for digital services, particularly in light of eIDAS 2.0 and
European Digital Identity Wallet initiatives. Open source solutions ensure transparency,
security, and interoperability.
Develop open source identity management systems, support decentralized identity
frameworks, create open source implementations of eIDAS standards, fund
authentication and authorization infrastructure.
Data Management and Analytics
Data is increasingly valuable, and organizations need sovereign control over data
infrastructure. Open source databases and analytics tools prevent vendor lock-in and
enable custom solutions.
Support European open source database development, fund big data and analytics
platforms, develop data governance and cataloging tools, support data mesh and
decentralized data architecture tools.
Quantum Computing
Quantum computing is an emerging technology with transformative potential. Early
investment in open source quantum software could position the EU advantageously as
hardware matures.
Fund open source quantum programming frameworks, support quantum simulation
tools, develop quantum algorithm libraries, create educational resources for quantum
software development.
5. Sectors for Increased Competitiveness and Cyber Resilience
Healthcare and Life Sciences
Healthcare generates vast sensitive data and requires interoperability across providers,
countries, and systems.
Financial Services
Financial sector has high cybersecurity requirements and is heavily regulated. Open
source can reduce systemic risks from proprietary monocultures while maintaining
security through transparency.
Energy and Utilities
Energy sector is critical infrastructure undergoing digital transformation with smart grids,
renewable integration, and decentralized generation. Open source can enhance security
and interoperability.
Telecommunications
Telecommunications infrastructure is strategic for digital sovereignty. Open source 5G
and future 6G technologies can reduce dependency on limited vendors and enhance
security.
Public Administration and Government Services
Digital government services require transparency, security, and interoperability. Open
source aligns well with public sector values and enables efficient cross-border
cooperation.
Manufacturing and Industry 4.0
The EU has strong manufacturing base that increasingly relies on digital technologies.
Open source industrial software can leverage this strength while avoiding foreign
dependencies.
Transportation and Logistics
Transportation is undergoing digital transformation with autonomous vehicles, smart
logistics, and multimodal integration. Open source can enable interoperability and
innovation.
Education and Research
Education and research naturally align with open source values of knowledge sharing.
Open source tools can enhance accessibility and collaboration while reducing costs.
       Opportunities Represented by the Adoption of OSS
      and Standard Document Formats on the EU Desktops
             as Part of the EU Open Source Strategy
                 The Document Foundation â February 3, 2026
Profile of The Document Foundation
The Document Foundation is a non-profit organisation based in Berlin and operating
under German law. It is focused on developing open source productivity solutions for
international organisations, government and non-government organisations, public
bodies, central and local administrations, schools and universities, companies and
individuals.
It pursues its objectives by developing the LibreOffice open source productivity suite and
filters for importing proprietary formats used by LibreOffice and other software (in
collaboration with the Document Liberation Project).
Several members of the LibreOffice project also contribute to the development of the
open document format ODF (OpenDocument Format), which is used natively by
LibreOffice and other open source software. It is also supported by proprietary software
such as Microsoft 365 and open-core software such as OnlyOffice and WPS Office.
Digital sovereignty: a priority for The Document Foundation
Since LibreOffice was born in 2010 and The Document Foundation was recognised by the
German authorities in 2012, its members have pursued the goal of digital sovereignty. This
concept was not widely recognised in 2010, but it is now acknowledged globally and
included in the European Union's digital strategy.
For this reason, The Document Foundation is contributing to the European Union's Open
Source Strategy consultation with this document. The focus is on two areas in which the
foundation can offer significant expertise: open source desktop software and standard,
open document formats.
Background on open source software on desktops in Europe
In Europe, open source software is almost completely absent from desktops and mobile
devices, which are the two main tools for interaction at an institutional, corporate and
personal level for the majority of European citizens. The ITRE study of December 2025
states that:
Android and iOS control virtually 100% of the mobile operating system market, while
Windows holds 73% of the desktop operating system market, with iOS accounting for
most of the remainder. Google Search accounts for over 89% of web searches, and US
platforms dominate almost the entire social media and browser market.
The situation is the same at the application level. A July 2025 Compass Lexecon study for
the Open Cloud Coalition attributes a 90% market share to the Microsoft Office suite in its
various forms (desktop and cloud), leaving Google with the remaining 10%.
This is despite the Interoperable Europe Act stating that public bodies should prioritise
solutions with non-restrictive licences, such as open source, over equivalent solutions
based on objective criteria such as functionality, total cost of ownership (TCO), user-
centricity and cybersecurity. However, these criteria appear to be disregarded in the
procurement process, as Microsoft is referenced far more frequently than any other
supplier, with an EU-wide market share of 72% in 2023 and 89% in 2024, according to the
Compass Lexecon study.
Are proprietary desktops really necessary for the EU?
It is worth emphasising at this point that this preference for proprietary desktop software
is not justified on technical grounds. There are open source solutions that can replace
proprietary solutions without negatively impacting functionality and that offer significant
advantages in terms of security, total cost of ownership (TCO) and user-centricity.
Migration from proprietary to open source solutions would also facilitate the transition
from proprietary to standard, open technologies in certain areas, such as email and office
documents, where the latter is the only option for digital sovereignty.
In the case of email, we are talking about standards defined in the era of Arpanet â the
global network infrastructure that gave rise to the internet â and therefore developed with
military-grade security objectives. Microsoft has not implemented these standards for its
email and collaboration solution, which is an integral part of the office suite, even several
decades later.
In the case of the Office suite, we are talking about the Open Document Format, a
standard defined in 2006 that Microsoft has never properly implemented, despite the fact
that the documentation is publicly available and the development activity, to which
Microsoft itself contributes, takes place according to a transparent process. There is also
no technical reason why implementation cannot take place according to the standard and
open specifications of the format itself.
Why the Open Document Format should be the default format
The Open Document Format (ODF) should form a key part of the EU's open source
strategy because it directly promotes digital sovereignty, long-term interoperability, and
independence from suppliers. It is also in line with the EU's broader goals of openness,
sustainability, and independence from proprietary ecosystems.
Let's take a closer look at the reasons behind this statement:
1. ODF strengthens digital sovereignty
â¢ ODF has been recognised as an ISO/IEC standard since 2006. It was developed
  transparently under the auspices of OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of
  Structured Information Standards), meaning it is completely independent of any single
  supplier, whether open source or proprietary, today and in the future.
â¢ ODF is comprehensively documented, including the process for developing new
  versions. This makes it easy to implement in all programmes, regardless of the
  software's type or development technology. Therefore, it can be used by both open
  source projects and proprietary applications.
â¢ Due to these characteristics, ODF is in line with the broader EU digital policy agenda,
  which emphasises open standards and open source solutions. It also responds
  perfectly to the objective of digital sovereignty, representing an independent choice
  that can interoperate with any type of software at all levels, thereby reducing lock-in to
  proprietary technologies while maintaining complete control over data and
  documents.
2. ODF guarantees interoperability at all levels
â¢ ODF supports the EU's "Think Open" principle and its commitment to interoperability in
  digital public services. This enables the exchange of files between operating systems
  and applications, and encourages the use of the most appropriate tools for each user's
  technical needs and economic circumstances. In this way, it promotes collaboration
  between institutions, companies, and individuals, enabling everyone to work more
  effectively and efficiently.
â¢ EU public administrations exchange millions of documents every day, both internally
  and with other public administrations around the world. Using ODF, a standard format
  that does not require specific hardware or software configuration, ensures
  interoperability at all levels and overcomes geographical, economic and social
  barriers.
3. ODF supports open source ecosystems
â¢ ODF encourages competition in the office suite market by treating all participants
  equally, whether they are open source projects or proprietary software vendors. It also
  promotes the development of projects for managing ODF-format documents at a
  European level thanks to the free access to the format documentation.
â¢ Developers can create new applications or solutions that exploit the opportunities
  offered by the ODF format to improve user productivity. This is particularly significant in
  sectors where robust, secure document structuring and long-term accessibility,
  independent of software, represent added value. One such sector is healthcare.
â¢ The open nature of the ODF format fosters community engagement and encourages
  contributions from developers worldwide. This can result in the development of
  software tailored to the unique requirements of countries, regions, industries,
  economic sectors, and minorities (including linguistic minorities, which are prevalent
  throughout the EU).
â¢ A diverse ecosystem aligns with the EU's goal of promoting the sustainable
  development of open source software and its associated production chain, comprising
  companies specialising in development, maintenance, technical support, training, and
  consultancy, as emphasised in recent political discussions.
4. ODF improves transparency and ensures long-term access
â¢ The open specifications of ODF ensure that future generations will be able to read
  today's documents without resorting to proprietary software. This approach is in line
  with the EU's emphasis on ethical, sustainable and transparent technologies.
â¢ The open format ODF simplifies the preservation of public documents because it has
  features that allow long-term access, even if the software used to create the
  documents is no longer available. These features include consistency between the
  documentation and the format, as well as the presence of the format version, which
  can be used to reconstruct the documents' features and analyse their contents, even
  decades later.
5. ODF reduces the cost of software solutions
â¢ Adopting ODF reduces costs associated with software licences and proprietary
  formats by making tools more accessible to public institutions and SMEs. This has a
   positive impact on public procurement and the overall cost of infrastructure in the EU
   and its member states.
â¢ Using ODF as a document standard encourages European companies to develop
   products, solutions and technologies based on open standards. This increases their
   competitiveness in the global market and achieves another of the EU's open source
   policy priorities.
6. ODF promotes digital skills
â¢ Thanks to its full and transparent documentation, ODF is a suitable platform for
  studying open formats and developing students' digital skills. It allows users to analyse
  file contents characterised by an XML schema that can be understood by those without
  specific programming language knowledge.
â¢ Using an open and standard format such as ODF promotes greater awareness among
  users of digital formats and their characteristics. This is because being able to view the
  contents of files encourages a deeper understanding of them.
Why the EU should not use the Microsoft 365 format
Ideally, this would be clear to both professionals and users. However, the reality of the
market tells us exactly the opposite, given that the proprietary format of Microsoft 365
(and previously Microsoft Office) documents is much more widespread. Therefore,
unfortunately, it is necessary to briefly examine the problems with the OOXML format and
explain why its use goes against the interests of everyone except Microsoft.
OOXML was approved by ISO/IEC in 2008, at the end of a controversial process, in two
versions.
â¢ Transitional, created to facilitate the transition â as the name suggests â from binary
  formats, and therefore the result of a compromise between the presence of non-
  standard components and the use of a very complex XML schema, to the point that it is
  not readable by users, contrary to the provisions of the W3C (World Wide Web
  Consortium) for XML language. Transitional was to be abandoned in 2010.
â¢ Strict, based on the same XML schema as the Transitional version and therefore
  problematic in terms of compliance with standards, characterised by many issues
  such as completely proprietary management of dates and colours, and with
  proprietary Microsoft elements such as the vector image format. Strict was to become
  the default format for Microsoft Office from 2010 onwards.
Sixteen years on from 2010, the default format for Microsoft 365 is still OOXML
Transitional. Meanwhile, OOXML Strict, which was included in the format menu as the
final option (to discourage use), has disappeared entirely. Consequently, the Microsoft
365 document format is entirely proprietary, as are all OOXML files in circulation.
The extraordinary length, complexity, technical omissions and single-vendor
dependencies of the OOXML format make implementation legally and practically
impossible.
Furthermore, many elements in the OOXML format are left undefined in the specifications
and are only interpreted correctly by Microsoft Office. This leads to obvious
interoperability problems when the theoretically standard format is used by alternative
software, despite the efforts of developers who are constantly trying to find solutions to
these problems.
How can the EU free itself from Microsoft's format based lock in?
The EU should consider the Open Document Format to be a technical standard for
document formatting and one of the main strategic tools for achieving its objectives in
terms of openness, interoperability, sustainability, and digital sovereignty.
Therefore, the EU should:
â¢ Investing in improving open source office suites that natively support the Open
  Document Format.
â¢ Provide guidelines for migrating to open source software on desktops, as well as
  training courses for staff at all levels within the public administrations of Member
  States. An initial reference protocol has been drawn up by The Document Foundation,
  based on European best practices.
â¢ Arrange meetings with Open Document Format experts at all levels to educate
  politicians, officials, technicians and users about the format, and to encourage its
  transparent adoption.
â¢ Include metrics relating to the adoption of the Open Document Format in reports on
  Member States' progress with their open source strategies.
â¢ Ensure consistent implementation of the standard by verifying compliance in all
  Member States.
The following is a concrete, policy-oriented roadmap which could realistically form part of
the next EU open source strategy.
1. Strategic positioning of ODF
â¢ Define ODF as a key resource for interoperability by explicitly listing it as a "strategic
   open standard" for documents, alongside open source software and open interfaces,
   based on the "Think Open" vision.
â¢ Link ODF to digital sovereignty and the single market by framing it as a prerequisite
   for cross-border digital public services and reducing vendor lock-in. This is in line with
   the EU's digital autonomy objectives.
2. Policy and regulation (years 1â2)
â¢ Adopt the "ODF by default" rule for EU institutions
   â¢ Internal rule: All new editable office documents created by EU institutions must be
      stored in OpenDocument Format, with other formats offered as additional export
      options only.
   â¢ External communication: the ODF format must always be accepted and clearly
      advertised as the preferred option when citizens or businesses submit documents.
â¢ Integrate ODF into interoperability and procurement frameworks
   â¢ Update the implementation guidelines to align with the European
      Interoperability Framework by indicating ODF as the reference format for all office
      documents in public sector interoperability profiles.
   â¢ Clauses relating to public procurement require full read/write support for ODF
      (not just import) in all office suite, document management, electronic archiving
      system and collaboration platform tenders.
â¢ Encourage alignment among Member States
  â¢ Recommend that Member States adopt policies providing for the default use of ODF
    in national and regional administrations.
  â¢ Where legally possible, link the adoption of ODF to funding priorities in digital public
    administration programmes.
3. Implementation and migration support (years 1â3)
â¢ Create an "ODF transition toolkit" for public administrations
  â¢ Practical guides to migration: inventory of formats, conversion strategies,
     templates, macros and accessibility.
  â¢ Training: Reusable training modules for civil servants working with ODF-compatible
     software suites.
  â¢ Change management: communication models for explaining changes to staff and
     external stakeholders.
â¢ Fund improvements in ODF-compatible open source tools
  â¢ Use EU programmes (e.g. Digital Europe, or ISA-style initiatives) to fund:
     â¢ Improved interoperability and fidelity: enhanced support for ODF, particularly
        for complex layouts, macros, accessibility and collaboration features.
     â¢ Preparing enterprises for stability and security, and integrating them with
        identity and registry management systems.
  â¢ Supporting bridges and converters
     â¢ To facilitate migration, invest in high-quality open source conversion tools
       between ODF and legacy/proprietary formats.
     â¢ Promote APIs and microservices that administrations can integrate into their
       existing workflows, such as automatic conversion to document gateways.
4. Governance and community engagement (years 1â4)
â¢ Give ODF a place in the Open Source Programme Office (OSPO)
  â¢ Expand the remit of the Commission's OSPO to encompass the management of
     open standards such as ODF, including monitoring adoption, coordinating
     contributions, and liaising with standardisation bodies.
  â¢ Treat ODF as part of the same "open ecosystem" as open source software, rather
     than as a separate entity.
â¢ Structured collaboration with communities and industry
  â¢ Set up an "ODF Interoperability Forum" involving open source projects, SMEs, major
    suppliers, archives and accessibility experts.
  â¢ Encourage public administrations to contribute bug reports, test cases and code to
    ODF-related co-development projects.
â¢ Standardisation and evolution
  â¢ Take an active role in the standardisation of the ODF to ensure the needs of the EU
    public sector are considered (e.g. multilingualism, accessibility and archiving
    requirements).
  â¢ Promote alignment between ODF and other relevant EU standards (e.g. eIDAS,
     eArchiving and accessibility standards).
5. Monitoring, metrics and accountability (years 2â5)
â¢ Define clear KPIs for ODF adoption
  â¢ Usage metrics
     â¢ Percentage of documents created internally and stored in ODF.
     â¢ Percentage of forms/templates intended for the public available in ODF.
  â¢ Procurement metrics
     â¢ Percentage of new IT systems with full support for reading and writing ODF
       documents.
  â¢ Interoperability metrics
     â¢ Number of cross-border services that exchange documents in ODF format.
â¢ Annual report on the review of the Open Source strategy
  â¢ Include a chapter on "Open Standards and ODF" in periodic reports on the progress
     of the EU Open Source Strategy. This chapter should contain data, success stories
     and information on any remaining obstacles.
â¢ Feedback
  â¢ Gather feedback from Member States, agencies and end users on practical issues,
    such as formatting problems and limited or inadequate training, and incorporate
    this into funding priorities and standardisation work.
6. Long-term consolidation (4â6 years)
â¢ Making ODF an integral part of the default design of digital public services
  â¢ Require any new EU-funded digital public services handling documents to support
    ODF end-to-end (i.e. for creation, editing, archiving and preservation).
  â¢ Integrate ODF into the reference architectures of government platforms and cloud
    environments.
â¢ Focus on archiving and cultural heritage
  â¢ Ensure that ODF is aligned with EU electronic archiving practices so that long-term
    preservation strategies explicitly recommend ODF for office documents created in
    digital format.
  â¢ Encourage the adoption of ODF for all editable content by cultural and research
    infrastructures.
â¢ Review and strengthen policies, where necessary
  â¢ If the adoption of ODF remains fragmented, stricter measures should be considered
    in terms of procurement and interoperability standards, based on data collected
    during the monitoring phase.
Open Source is how the EU creates and shares software, ODF is how the EU
maintains control over the information created by the software.
