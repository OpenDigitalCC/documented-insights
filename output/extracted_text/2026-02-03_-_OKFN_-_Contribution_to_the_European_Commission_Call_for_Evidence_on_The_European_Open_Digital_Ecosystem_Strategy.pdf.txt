This is a position paper / submission responding to the European Commission's 2026 public
consultation / call for evidence on the European Union Strategy âThe European Open Digital
Ecosystem Strategyâ (aimed at setting a strategic approach to the open source sector in the EU
that addresses the importance of open source as a crucial contribution to EU technological
sovereignty, security and competitiveness and a strategic and operational framework to
strengthen the use, development and reuse of open digital assets within the Commission,
building on the results achieved under the 2020-2023 Commission Open Source Software
Strategy.

Executive Summary
This position paper, submitted by Open Knowledge Sweden, Open Knowledge Foundation,
Open Knowledge Finland, and Open Knowledge Estonia, responds to the European
Commission's 2026 Call for Evidence on "The European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy."
Drawing on two decades of experience in building and supporting open digital infrastructure, we
provide observations and recommendations to advance the EU's strategic approach to open
source, emphasizing its role in enhancing technological sovereignty, security, competitiveness,
and the Commission's internal use of open digital assets, building on the 2020-2023 Open
Source Software Strategy.

The EU open-source sector boasts significant strengths, including one of the world's largest
developer communities (nearly 25 million EU-based contributors generating over 155 million
annual contributions), alignment with EU principles like transparency and GDPR compliance,
and contributions to 70-90% of global software codebases. Successes such as FIWARE,
RISC-V, and Simpl demonstrate innovation in AI, cloud, and data spaces, contributing â¬65-95
billion to EU GDP. However, weaknesses include uneven organizational maturity (only 34%
have formal strategies; 22% have OSPOs), value exploitation by non-EU entities, and barriers
like vendor lock-in, underfunding for maintenance, legal concerns, and skill gaps, which hinder
adoption, contributions, and scaling.

Open source adds substantial value to public and private sectors by enabling sovereignty, cost
savings, reduced lock-in, enhanced security, and innovation. Public examples include France's
Nextcloud deployments and Estonia's X-Road for efficient, resilient e-services; private benefits
encompass productivity gains (63% of organizations) and competitiveness in telecom and
automotive. Key factors: TCO reduction, transparency, and collaborative ecosystems.

To support growth, we recommend dedicated funding (e.g., â¬1-2 billion via Digital Europe
Programme), "open by default" procurement with EU-owned company preferences (EuroStack),
sovereign infrastructure (e.g., expanding Codeberg/Gaia-X), public-private partnerships,
cybersecurity mandates, and capacity building. Prioritize technology areas like open AI,
cloud/edge, cybersecurity tools, RISC-V hardware, and IoT/industrial applications due to high
dependencies and sovereignty risks. Amplify OSS in sectors such as public administration,
healthcare, automotive, energy, and finance/telecom to boost competitiveness and resilience.

These measures will unlock open source's potential, reducing external dependencies, fostering
innovation, and positioning the EU as a global leader in resilient digital ecosystems. We urge
swift implementation through pilots and monitoring to achieve quick wins.

Introduction
As pioneers in the social and academic sectors, the Open Knowledge network brings two
decades of experience building, stewarding, and supporting open digital ecosystems and open
digital infrastructure used by public administrations, civil society, academia, and innovators
across Europe and globally. We submit the following observations and recommendations in
response to the consultation questions.

Key Questions and Themes

1. Strengths and Weaknesses of the EU Open-Source Sector;
Barriers to Adoption, Maintenance, and Contributions

The EU open-source sector exhibits notable strengths that position it as a vital asset for
technological sovereignty, innovation, and alignment with European values. The EU hosts one
of the world's largest and most active communities of open-source developers, with nearly 25
million EU-based contributors on developer platforms like GitHub. This is generating over 155
million contributions annually. This ecosystem produces high-quality code that underpins
70-90% of modern software solutions globally, including foundational tools in AI, cloud, and
cybersecurity. European open-source work is particularly well-aligned with EU digital principles,
such as transparency, privacy (e.g., GDPR compatibility), interoperability, and ethical
considerations, fostering trust and collaboration. Grassroots adoption remains strong, supported
by thriving communities, academia-industry partnerships, and contributions to global projects
(e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch, spaCy). Success stories include initiatives like FIWARE, RISC-V
investments via the Chips Joint Undertaking, the Simpl programme for secure middleware in
data spaces, and emerging efforts in open AI models and hardware. These demonstrate the
sector's capacity for innovation, especially in areas like high-performance computing, edge
computing, and sovereign alternatives, while contributing significantly to the EU economy
(estimated â¬65-95 billion to GDP in prior studies, with potential for growth).

Despite these strengths, the sector faces significant weaknesses that limit its scalability,
economic impact, and ability to capture value within Europe. Much of the economic benefit from
EU-developed open-source code is exploited outside the EU, often by large non-EU tech
companies, due to limited commercialization and market integration of European projects as
well as lack of prioritizing EU owned companies in procurements. Organizational maturity is
uneven: widespread passive consumption of open source exists, but formal strategies are
lacking (only around 34% of organizations have them, per 2025 Linux Foundation Europe
research), and Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) are rare (about 22%). Executive/C-suite
recognition of open source's strategic value lags behind employee enthusiasm (86% of
employees value it, but only ~60% of leaders do). This results in fragmented efforts, insufficient
long-term investment, and challenges in transitioning from research/innovation funding to
sustainable scaling and industrial deployment.

The main barriers hampering progress fall into two key areas:

(i) Adoption and maintenance of high-quality and secure open source

   ââ High entry barriers and network effects from dominant (often non-EU) proprietary players
      create vendor lock-in, especially in public procurement and private markets, where
      tenders often favor or default to proprietary solutions.
   ââ Limited access to growth capital, scalable hosting infrastructures (e.g., EU-based
      repositories and cloud platforms), and technical support hinders sustainability.
   ââ Maintenance challenges include maintainer burnout, underfunding for long-term upkeep
      of critical components, and perceived (though often overstated) security risks, despite
      open source's advantages in transparent vulnerability management.
   ââ Legal/licensing concerns (35%), lack of understanding of non-technical benefits (34%),
      and compliance fears under regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act slow broader
      uptake.
   ââ In sectors like SMEs and public administrations, skill gaps, immediate-cost focus over
      total cost of ownership, and ecosystem fragmentation across Member States exacerbate
      issues.
(ii) Sustainable contributions to open-source communities

   ââ Legal and intellectual property fears (31% cite licensing concerns, 24% fear IP leakage)
      discourage private sector involvement.
   ââ Uncertainty about return on investment (ROI) for contributions (28%), combined with
      limited incentives (e.g., no widespread tax breaks or recognition for code upstreaming).
   ââ Reliance on volunteer or research-driven models without adequate
      business/sustainability frameworks leads to unsustainable projects.
   ââ Bureaucratic hurdles in public-private partnerships and a cultural gap where open source
      is valued technically but not always strategically at leadership levels.

Addressing these barriers through targeted EU policy, funding, and infrastructure support could
unlock the sector's full potential, reducing external dependencies, enhancing cybersecurity
resilience, and boosting EU competitiveness in critical digital technologies.

2. Added Value of Open Source for Public and Private Sectors;
Concrete Examples and Factors

Open source delivers substantial added value to both the public and private sectors in
the EU, serving as a strategic enabler for technological sovereignty, economic efficiency,
democracy, innovation, and resilience. It underpins 70-90% of modern software codebases
globally and contributes significantly to the EU economyâestimated at a minimum of â¬65-95
billion annually to GDP (per European Commission research and related studies), with potential
for further growth through increased contributions. By providing transparent, modifiable, and
redistributable solutions, open source reduces dependencies on non-EU proprietary vendors,
enables and enhances control over the European Unionâs and member statesâ digital
infrastructure, and aligns with core EU principles such as data protection, interoperability, and
ethical technology use.

For the public sector, open source offers critical advantages in cost efficiency, security,
transparency, and independence from foreign influence. Key factors include:

   ââ Cost savings and lower total cost of ownership (TCO): Avoiding recurring licensing
      fees frees up budgets for core services. For instance, large-scale deployments in
      France, such as Nextcloud-based sovereign collaboration platforms, have supported
      hundreds of thousands to millions of users in public administrations, schools, and
      regional governments (e.g., Ãle-de-France's platform for 550,000 students and staff),
      replacing proprietary alternatives from a non-EU company while ensuring GDPR
      compliance and data sovereignty.
   ââ Reduced vendor lock-in and enhanced sovereignty: Public entities gain flexibility to
      customize and switch providers. Examples include Germany's Schleswig-Holstein
      transitioning 30,000 civil servants to LibreOffice and Linux, Denmark's Ministry of Digital
      Affairs piloting open-source office tools to phase out non-EU based office toolsâ , and
      France's Gendarmerie migrating 90,000 workstations to Ubuntu-based
      GendBuntuâdemonstrating long-term independence from non-EU ecosystems and
      strengthening the EU based IT industry and EU economies.
   ââ Security and transparency: Community-driven audits enable faster vulnerability
      detection and patching, crucial for public trust in critical systems (e.g., Estonia's X-Road
      for interoperable e-government services).
   ââ Innovation and public good alignment: Open source accelerates collaborative
      development of citizen-centric tools, such as secure data spaces or e-ID systems, while
      supporting compliance with EU regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act.

For the private sector, open source drives competitiveness through accelerated innovation,
productivity gains, and risk mitigation. Recent surveys (e.g., Linux Foundation Europe's 2025
World of Open Source Europe Report) highlight that:

   ââ Higher productivity and quality: 63% of European organizations report increased
      productivity from open source, with 75% noting higher-quality software due to
      collaborative development and reuse of components.
   ââ Reduced vendor lock-in and lower costs: 62% cite avoidance of lock-in and 58%
      lower software ownership costs as major benefits, enabling faster iteration and resource
      reallocation.
   ââ Innovation and market edge: 69% of respondents believe open source engagement
      makes organizations more competitive, with 58% seeing it as key to future
      innovationâparticularly in sectors like telecom, automotive, finance, and energy, where
      companies contribute to shared projects for mutual advantage.
   ââ Concrete examples: In telecommunications, providers like Greece's Nova leverage
      open source (with Canonical support) for cloud infrastructure to control costs and scale
      efficiently. In automotive and manufacturing, open-source stacks (e.g., via Chips JU
      investments in RISC-V or software-defined vehicles) enable EU firms to innovate without
      proprietary dependencies. Open AI models and tools foster rapid prototyping and ethical
      AI development aligned with EU values.

Overall, the most important factors for assessing added value are cost (savings and TCO),
risk reduction (via transparency and no hidden backdoors), avoidance of lock-in, security
(community oversight), and innovation speed (collaborative ecosystems). These benefits
often outweigh costsâ56% of surveyed organizations report that open source advantages
exceed or greatly exceed expensesâwhile directly supporting EU goals of competitiveness,
cybersecurity resilience, and reduced external dependencies. Wider adoption, especially in
critical sectors, could amplify these impacts, turning open source into a foundational pillar for
Europe's digital future.

3. Concrete Measures and Actions at EU Level to Support
Development, Growth, Sovereignty, and Cybersecurity
Concrete measures and actions at EU level should focus on a holistic, multi-year strategy
that addresses the full open-source lifecycleâfrom development and maintenance to
sustainability, deployment, market integration, and industrial scalingâwhile directly advancing
technological sovereignty, competitiveness, and cybersecurity. Building on existing initiatives like
the Digital Commons European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (DC EDIC, launched
December 2025), the review of the 2020-2023 open-source strategy, the Next Generation
Internet programme, FIWARE, Simpl middleware, RISC-V investments, and complementary
regulations (e.g., Cyber Resilience Act, NIS2, forthcoming Cloud and AI Development Act), the
EU can implement targeted, actionable steps.

Key proposed measures include:

   ââ Dedicated funding mechanisms beyond R&I grants to ensure long-term
      sustainability: Allocate specific budgets under Digital Europe Programme or a new
      dedicated Open Digital Ecosystems Fund (e.g., â¬1-2 billion over 2026-2030) for critical
      open-source projects. This should prioritize maintenance of foundational components
      (e.g., via bounties or stewardship grants), security audits, and community support to
      prevent maintainer burnout and vulnerabilities. Expand successful models like
      Germany's Sovereign Tech Agency to an EU level, funding "digital public goods" in
      strategic areas.
   ââ Policy incentives for adoption and contribution: Introduce an "open by default"
      principle in public procurement across Member States, mandating evaluation of
      open-source alternatives in tenders (with weighting for sovereignty, security, and
      interoperability). Prioritize companies with EU based ownership submitting offers in
      public procurements when the offering is building on open source and making their
      solution available open source without vendor lock-in. This is important to increase
      digital sovereignty and reduce risks for national security or shutdowns of public sectors
      systems due to foreign influence. Provide tax incentives or fiscal credits for private sector
      contributions to open-source projects (e.g., upstreaming code or funding maintainers),
      similar to existing R&D tax schemes. Develop EU-wide certification schemes for secure,
      sovereign open-source solutions, aligned with the Cyber Resilience Act and NIS2, to
      build trust and facilitate market entry.
   ââ Strengthen EU-centred infrastructure and hosting: Invest in sovereign alternatives to
      non-EU platforms, such as expanding EU-based code repositories (e.g., Codeberg, or
      new federated systems such as Forgejo which is enabling Codeberg), cloud platforms
      (Gaia-X integration), and software-defined infrastructure tools. Support the DC EDIC as
      a "one-stop shop" for open-source communities, developers, and adoptersâproviding
      funding pathways, technical/legal expertise, cross-border collaboration, and reusable
      building blocks for public administrations.
   ââ Public-private partnerships and business model innovation: Foster scalable models
      through public-private consortia, incubators, and accelerators for open-source startups
      and SMEs. Promote sustainability frameworks (e.g., dual licensing, foundation-backed
      models) and partnerships like those in automotive (software-defined vehicle stacks via
      Chips JU) or AI (open models under GenAI4EU). Encourage large customers (public
      sector, corporates) to contribute back via mandates or best-practice guidelines.
   ââ Cybersecurity and sovereignty-focused actions: Mandate security-by-design in
      critical open-source projects funded by EU programmes, with regular audits and
      vulnerability disclosure processes. Prioritize open-source in high-risk sectors (e.g., under
      NIS2 supply-chain rules) to reduce third-country dependencies. Develop common criteria
      for "sovereign" open-source solutions, including transparency, interoperability, and no
      hidden backdoors.
   ââ Capacity building and ecosystem growth: Launch EU-wide training programmes for
      developers, SMEs, and public administrations on open-source governance, security, and
      contribution. Support emerging communities via mentorship, hackathons, and visibility
      platforms to showcase EU high-quality solutions. Monitor progress through dedicated
      indicators (e.g., adoption rates in public tenders, number of EU-founded projects
      reaching industrial scale) and periodic external studies.

These measures, combining policy, funding, and infrastructure, would stimulate wider adoption,
commoditize expensive proprietary stacks, free resources for innovation, and position open
source as a cornerstone of EUâs technological sovereignty. They align with Council conclusions
on competitiveness (December 2025) emphasizing open standards and reduced lock-in, while
complementing ongoing simplifications in digital rules. Implementation could start with pilots in
priority areas (AI, cloud, cybersecurity, automotive) to demonstrate quick wins and build
momentum toward a resilient, competitive EU open digital ecosystem.

4. Technology Areas to Prioritize and Why
The EU should prioritize the following technology areas in its open digital ecosystems
strategy, as they represent critical domains with high external dependencies, rapid innovation
potential, and direct relevance to technological sovereignty, competitiveness, cybersecurity, and
industrial resilience. These priorities align closely with the Commission's stated focus areas
(internet technologies, cloud, AI, cybersecurity, open hardware, and industrial applications such
as automotive and manufacturing) and ongoing investments (e.g., RISC-V via Chips Joint
Undertaking, Simpl middleware, GenAI4EU, and the forthcoming Cloud and AI Development
Act).

   1.â Artificial Intelligence (especially open AI models and frameworks) Why prioritize:
       The exponential growth of open AI models offers a unique opportunity to reduce reliance
       on non-EU closed systems (e.g., from US providers), while enabling transparent, ethical,
       and customizable AI aligned with EU values like privacy and trustworthiness.
       Open-source AI fosters collaborative innovation, accelerates sector-specific applications
       (e.g., multilingual models for Europe's diversity), and supports sovereignty by avoiding
       data-extractive proprietary stacks. Prioritizing this area would boost EU competitiveness
       in a field where Europe already has strengths (e.g., models from Mistral AI and
       communities like Hugging Face), while mitigating risks from black-box technologies in
       high-stakes uses. Investments here could commoditize expensive AI infrastructure and
       drive industrial uptake under GenAI4EU.
   2.â Cloud and Edge Computing Why prioritize: These form the backbone of digital
       infrastructure, with ~80% of the EU cloud market dominated by non-EU providers,
       creating vendor lock-in, data sovereignty risks, and supply chain vulnerabilities.
       Open-source solutions (e.g., integrated with Gaia-X) enable sovereign alternatives,
       interoperability, and cost-effective scaling for SMEs and public sector. Edge computing is
       essential for low-latency, privacy-preserving applications in IoT and real-time processing.
       Prioritizing open cloud/edge would reduce dependencies, enhance resilience in critical
       infrastructure, and complement the Cloud and AI Development Act by providing
       verifiable, open foundations for hybrid deployments.
   3.â Cybersecurity Tools and Software Supply Chain Security Why prioritize: Open
       source powers foundational cybersecurity components (e.g., OpenSSL, encryption
       libraries), but vulnerabilities in widely used projects can have cascading effects.
       Prioritizing secure open-source tools, governance, and maintenance (e.g., audits,
       vulnerability management) directly strengthens EU resilience under NIS2 and the Cyber
       Resilience Act. It addresses supply chain transparency issues, reduces hidden
       backdoors from proprietary sources, and builds trust in digital infrastructureâcritical as
       cyber threats rise. This area yields high ROI: community-driven patching accelerates
       response times compared to closed systems.
   4.â Open Hardware (particularly RISC-V and related architectures) Why prioritize:
       Hardware dependencies (e.g., on non-EU chips) pose strategic risks in computing, edge,
       and high-performance applications. RISC-V, an open Instruction Set Architecture,
       enables EU-led innovation in sovereign processors for HPC, edge/IoT, and AI
       accelerators, as supported by Chips JU projects (e.g., AERO, RISER). Prioritizing open
       hardware counters geopolitical supply risks, fosters modular designs, and supports
       emerging ecosystems in edge AI and IoTâkey for Europe's industrial competitiveness
       and reducing reliance on closed architectures.
   5.â Internet Technologies, IoT, and Industrial Applications (e.g., Automotive and
       Manufacturing) Why prioritize: These interconnected areas underpin critical sectors
       where open source can disrupt monopolies and enhance resilience. In automotive,
       open-source software-defined vehicle stacks (via Chips JU) enable faster innovation,
       supply chain transparency, and independence from proprietary vendors. IoT platforms
       and internet technologies benefit from open standards for interoperability in smart
       manufacturing and connected systems. Prioritizing them accelerates standardization,
       supports EU core industries (e.g., automotive as a flagship), and boosts cyber resilience
       by allowing verifiable components in high-risk environments.

Rationale for these priorities overall: These areas exhibit the highest combination of
dependency risks (non-EU dominance and risk of union security and national security),
economic/strategic impact (critical infrastructure and industrial ecosystems), and open-source
leverage (transparency, collaboration, rapid iteration). Targeted support would yield outsized
benefits: reducing external dependencies, accelerating EU innovation ecosystems, enhancing
cybersecurity through community oversight, and enabling market integration of sovereign
solutions. Focusing resources hereâvia funding, partnerships, and policyâwould demonstrate
quick wins, build momentum for broader adoption, and position open source as a foundational
enabler of Europe's long-term technological sovereignty and global competitiveness.

5. Sectors for Increased OSS Use to Boost Competitiveness and
Cyber Resilience
Increased use of open source in targeted sectors can significantly boost EU
competitiveness by accelerating innovation cycles, reducing costs through shared
development, avoiding vendor lock-in, and enabling faster adaptation to market and
technological changes. Simultaneously, it enhances cyber resilience by promoting transparent
codebases, community-driven vulnerability management, supply chain visibility (e.g., via
SBOMs), and verifiable componentsâaligning with NIS2, the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and
broader sovereignty goals. Open source disrupts proprietary monopolies, fosters interoperability,
and supports resilient digital infrastructure in high-dependency or critical areas.

Key sectors where amplified open-source adoption would deliver outsized benefits include:

   ââ Public Administration and E-Government Why: Public sector digital services face high
      dependencies on non-EU proprietary vendors, leading to lock-in, high costs, and
      sovereignty risks. Open source enables interoperable, transparent platforms compliant
      with GDPR and EU digital principles. Increased use would lower TCO, improve
      cross-border services (e.g., via data spaces and interoperability), and strengthen cyber
      resilience through auditable code. Examples: Estonia's X-Road (open-source backbone
      for secure e-services) demonstrates seamless interoperability and resilience; France and
      Germany's migrations to LibreOffice/Linux in administrations show cost savings and
      independence. Scaling this EU-wide (e.g., via DC EDIC) would enhance public trust and
      efficiency.
   ââ Healthcare Why: Healthcare relies on secure data sharing, AI diagnostics, and
      connected devices amid rising cyber threats to patient data and systems. Open source
      facilitates collaborative development of privacy-preserving tools, ethical AI, and
      interoperable health data spacesâreducing dependencies on closed vendors and
      enabling rapid, community-vetted security updates. It boosts competitiveness by
      lowering barriers for EU startups in medtech/digital health. Examples: Open-source
      frameworks in EU data spaces for secure health data exchange; potential for reference
      implementations (as proposed in related roadmaps) using European FOSS building
      blocks to support personalized medicine and telemedicine while enhancing resilience
      against ransomware.
   ââ Automotive and Manufacturing (including Software-Defined Vehicles) Why: The
      automotive sector is shifting to software-defined, connected, and electric vehicles, with
      heavy reliance on proprietary stacks creating supply chain vulnerabilities and innovation
      bottlenecks. Open-source approaches enable collaborative stacks, modular designs,
      and faster iterationâcritical for EU's industrial core competitiveness. Cyber resilience
      improves through transparent components and community patching in high-risk
      connected systems. Examples: Chips Joint Undertaking investments in RISC-V and
      open software-defined vehicle cores (e.g., SDVoF initiatives, AERO/RISER projects)
      allow EU OEMs/suppliers to build sovereign alternatives, reduce non-EU dependencies,
      and integrate open hardware/software for edge/IoT in manufacturing. Wider adoption
      would accelerate standardization and support green/connected mobility transitions.
   ââ Energy and Critical Infrastructure (e.g., Smart Grids, Renewables) Why: Energy
      systems face growing cyber-physical threats (e.g., attacks on grids) and dependencies
      on foreign tech for IoT/smart controls. Open source promotes interoperable, verifiable
      platforms for smart energy management, enhancing resilience via transparent supply
      chains and rapid vulnerability fixes. It drives competitiveness in renewables/digitalization
      by lowering costs and enabling EU-led innovation. Examples: Open-source IoT platforms
      for energy data spaces; potential extensions of Simpl middleware for secure, sovereign
      energy applicationsâreducing risks in critical infrastructure under CER Directive and
      NIS2.
   ââ Finance and Telecommunications Why: These sectors handle sensitive
      data/transactions with high cyber exposure. Open source supports secure, auditable
      tools (e.g., blockchain frameworks, encryption libraries) while avoiding lock-in in
      cloud/telecom infrastructure. It fosters innovation in fintech/regtech and resilient
      networks. Examples: Open-source contributions in secure transaction platforms; telecom
      providers using open stacks (e.g., for cloud-native 5G/edge) to enhance sovereignty and
      patch speed.

Overall rationale: These sectors combine high external dependencies, critical
societal/economic impact, and vulnerability to cyber threatsâmaking open source a strategic
lever for resilience (transparent auditing, community response) and competitiveness (cost
efficiency, collaborative R&D, market agility). Prioritizing them would create spill-over effects:
commoditizing proprietary solutions, freeing resources for EU innovation, and demonstrating
tangible sovereignty gains through pilots and consortia. This aligns with EU priorities in
industrial ecosystems, data spaces, and regulations like CRA/NIS2, turning open source into a
multiplier for long-term digital autonomy and prosperity.

EU Trade, aid and emergency assistance need to be aligned as part of the
strategy
International aid, development cooperation, and technical assistance should be explicitly
integrated as core components of European open digital ecosystems. Open-source
technologies and digital public goods offer a democratic, bottom-up model of digital cooperation
that prioritises partnership, local ownership, and long-term sustainability over dependence on
proprietary vendors.

This approach is particularly relevant in the context of recent and emerging trade and
cooperation agreements with partners such as India and Mercosur countries, which are global
leaders in open-source development and adoption. Embedding open digital infrastructure into
these partnerships enables joint development and shared governance of digital public goods,
supports cross-regional collaboration between public administrations, civil society, and
developer communities, and allows the EU and its partners to address global challenges such
as climate change, public health, migration, inequality, and democratic resilience through
interoperable and reusable solutions.

Beyond its internal benefits, this represents a significant diplomatic opportunity. By championing
open, interoperable, and publicly governed digital infrastructure, the EU can position itself
globally as a trusted partner in digital transformation, a promoter of democratic digital
governance, and a leader in sustainable, non-extractive technology cooperation. Investment in
open digital public goods creates shared global assets while reinforcing European values and
standards and strengthening the EUâs soft power.

Recommendations
   ââ Prioritize EU-based and EEA/EU-owned companies building on open source software
      and providing their solutions as open source in public procurements. See the industry
      initiative EuroStack.eu. Make this a priority in the revised EUâs public procurement
      directive.
   ââ Establish a dedicated EU funding programme for the long-term maintenance, security,
      and governance of critical open digital infrastructure and digital public goods.
   ââ Establish a dedicated EU funding programme to fund research focused on the
      economic, social and security impact of open technologies powering the open digital
      ecosystem.
   ââ Promote and create EU-wide platforms for the secure exchange of code, tools and
      expertise across open source technical teams, to avoid centralisation in commercial
      infrastructures vulnerable to being affected by a kill switch.
   ââ Create multi-year operational funding instruments for open-source foundations and civic
      organisations that steward widely used public-interest technologies. Together with it,
      allocate resources for them to benefit from the emergent public AI infrastructure,
      including the AI factories.
   ââ Integrate open-source and open-licensing requirements as mandatory into EU-funded
      digital projects, including digital literacy, public infrastructure, social protection,
      emergency management and development cooperation as well as all technical
      assistance programmes. This will enable South - South exchanges, increase the ability
      to solve problems at scale and optimise the resources.
   ââ Launch joint EUâpartner country initiatives with regions such as India and Mercosur,
      focused on the co-development and shared governance of open technologies, the
      exchange of local capacities, as well as the distribution of the maintenance and
      innovation of open digital public goods.
   ââ Align public procurement, funding, and policy instruments to incentivise the adoption of
      open technologies and contribute back to upstream projects.
   ââ Support shared services, hosting, and support infrastructures to enable public
      administrations to adopt open-source solutions at scale. This is particularly relevant for
      municipalities and decentralised entities.
   ââ Strengthen coordination between digital policy, trade, and international partnership
      instruments to ensure coherence between internal EU objectives and external action.

      maintenance, and improvement of this ecosystem.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the Open Knowledge network strongly endorses the European Commission's
initiative to advance the European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy, recognizing open source
as an indispensable pillar for achieving technological sovereignty, enhanced cybersecurity,
economic competitiveness, and democratic resilience across the EU. By addressing the
identified strengthsâsuch as Europe's vibrant developer communities and alignment with core
EU valuesâand overcoming weaknesses like vendor lock-in, underfunding for maintenance,
and fragmented adoption, the EU can unlock open source's full potential to reduce external
dependencies and foster innovation.

Our recommendationsâranging from dedicated funding mechanisms and "open by default"
procurement policies to prioritizing EU-based open source solutions, key technology areas like
open AI, cloud/edge, and RISC-V hardware, and amplifying OSS adoption in critical sectors
such as public administration, healthcare, and automotive â provide an actionable roadmap for
building sustainable, antifragile digital ecosystems. Implementing these measures will not only
commoditize proprietary stacks, stimulate SME growth, and generate economic multipliers (e.g.,
through increased contributions and GDP impacts), but also position Europe as a global leader
in ethical, interoperable digital infrastructure.

We urge the Commission to prioritize these proposals in its forthcoming strategy, starting with
pilots and monitoring frameworks to ensure measurable progress. The Open Knowledge
network stands ready to collaborate with stakeholders to realize this vision, ensuring a resilient
digital future for all Europeans. For further discussion, please contact us at contact@okfn.se.
