     Towards European open digital
     ecosystems
     February 2026 | Feedback by 1io Brandguardian GmbH, Germany

     1) What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are
     the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and
     secure open source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to openâsource communities?

     The EU open-source sector is characterized by a high volume of talent and foundational
     contributions to global software, but it struggles with strategic maturity and economic value
     leakage. While the EU produces a signi cant share of global research, much of the resulting
     economic bene t is captured by non-EU entities.

     Strengths/Weaknesses: The primary strength of the EU open-source sector lies in its thriving
     developer communities and strong alignment with digital rights and ethical principles. It serves as
     a vehicle for innovation and vendor independence, essential for digital sovereignty. However, the
     sector is weakened by a chronic dependency on non-EU digital technologies and a lack of
     cohesive top-down strategy within organizations. Only a small fraction of European organizations
     maintain formal open-source strategies, leading to uneven maturity across the ecosystem.

     Sustainable contributions are hampered by legal uncertainty and compliance overhead. New
     regulatory requirements (e.g., cybersecurity and AI compliance duties) can be di cult to
     operationalize for small teams and community projects without shared tooling, templates, and
     proportional compliance pathways. In addition, many investors still misunderstand open source
     as âeasy to copyâ and therefore less defensible, which can stop funding discussions before
     technical realities and business models are properly assessed.

     i)
     Limited access to growth capital and essential infrastructure. Procurement policies often remain
     outdated and incompatible with open-source models. Established proprietary vendors are often
     favored, especially by SMEs. Their pricing is hard to compete with.

     A signi cant skills gap exists in public and non-tech sectors, where organizational inertia and a
     lack of understanding of open-source value prevent integration. Maintenance is often
     underfunded, with critical projects relying on a very small number of unpaid individuals, creating
     systemic security risks.

     ii)
     Sustainable contributions are discouraged by regulatory complexity and legal uncertainty. New
     frameworks like the Cyber Resilience Act and the AI Act, while providing necessary safeguards,
     can impose excessive administrative burdens on small, volunteer-driven communities that
     struggle with formal documentation and attestation requirements. There is often uncertainty
     regarding the ROI for commercial entities to contribute back to projects.

     From personal experience, our company also was heavily challenged with overcoming the
     knowledge gap with conventional investors (especially private equity/family o ces, but also with
     VCs). For a lot of them, open-source means no protection against e.g. giants like Microsoft
     copying your product. All these considerations take place before an investor consults his experts
     on the given regulatory challenges in the open-source sector, meaning "the door is closed" before
     an opportunity has even presented itself to sustainably contribute to the space.

     The EU should support the e orts of the community to educate on open-source, so that the rst
     thought is not "risk management".

     2) What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
     provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in,
     security, innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added
     value.

     For the public sector, open source is a technical cornerstone of digital sovereignty, enabling
     governments to maintain independent control over digital infrastructure and reducing dependency
     on non-EU tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, etc.

     Open-source allows public administrations to (freely) use, adapt, and host technology on their
     "own terms" using infrastructure of their choosing, but most importantly in a transparent fashion.
     If you can check the source code, you can see for yourself that there's nothing malicious in there
     â Security is enhanced through transparency; open code also allows for public scrutiny and
     community-driven identi cation and patching of vulnerabilities, which is often superior to closed-
     source alternatives.

     In the private sector, open-source can drastically accelerate development processes (and thus
     innovation, if done right) by providing reusable building blocks.
     As a small company (40+ employees), we shortened development time signi cantly by using
     open-source libraries and components within our own product.

     Key factors for assessing this added value include cost, risk, lock-in, and security considerations.
     Open-source can upfront costs by (in most cases) eliminating licensing fees, though a transition
     to Open-source products can be costly, especially for bigger companies, since teams need to be
     trained etc. Transitioning to OS thus becomes a board topic.

     Speaking of risk management: Open-source mitigates the risk of vendor lock-in, as users are not
     tied to a single vendor's development roadmap or pricing, ensuring long-term exibility and
     freedom of choice.

     Example from practice: COkit is an openâsource SDK designed to enable localâ rst collaborative
     applications. Data can remain on end devices or within clearly de ned sovereign domains, while
     collaboration is enabled via peerâtoâpeer synchronization and cryptographic veri cation. This
     illustrates how openâsource components can support sovereignty and resilience goals without
     requiring mandatory dependence on a centralized cloud platform.

     3) What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
     development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
     technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

     First: Quickly establish a 28th regime for a harmonized European company legal form speci cally
     for open-source foundations to simplify all business operations and talent attraction accross the
     EU

     Second: Integrate mandatory digital sovereignty and open-source contribution modules into all
     EU-funded engineering and computer science university curricula.

     Third: Create a European Open Source Trust Label to provide automated cybersecurity
     certi cation pathways for homegrown software, easing compliance burdens for SMEs.

     â¢ Modernize public procurement for open source: move from licenseâcentric criteria to outcomeâ
     and riskâbased criteria (security, auditability, interoperability, portability), and explicitly fund
     maintenance and security work (not only initial build).

     â¢ Create stable, multiâyear funding instruments for maintenance of widely used openâsource
     components (including security audits, coordinated vulnerability handling, and professional

     stewardship).

     â¢ Provide shared compliance support for small teams and communities: reference processes,
     model documentation, and lightweight tooling for meeting cybersecurity and AI requirements
     proportionately.

     â¢ Strengthen open standards and interoperability requirements in EU programs and public sector
     systems to reduce lockâin and enable competitive implementation ecosystems.

     4) What technology areas should be prioritized and why?

     Priority should be given to baseâlayer capabilities that are broadly reusable across sectors:

     i)
     Localâ rst and edgeâcapable collaboration primitives.
     Architectures that keep systems functional under degraded connectivity, reduce central points of
     failure, and allow sovereign deployments.

     ii)
     Interoperable dataâsharing mechanisms (âdata roomsâ) and open standards.
     Common interoperability speci cations to enable switching between providers, crossâborder
     collaboration, and reusable European data spaces.

     iii)
     Provenance, traceability, and veri able data handling for AI systems, especially in highârisk
     domains, to support oversight and accountability.

     iv)
     Selfâsovereign identity and granular permissions.
     Decentralized identity, veri able credentials, and neâgrained access control to prevent
     exploitation, enable user choice, and support secure crossâorganization collaboration.

     5) In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased
     competitiveness and cyber resilience?

     "In recent years, data-driven technologies have had transformative e ects on all sectors of the
     economy. The proliferation of products connected to the internet in particular has increased the
     volume and potential value of data for consumers, businesses and society. High-quality and
     interoperable data from di erent domains increase competitiveness and innovation and ensure
     sustainable economic growth" (EU Data Act)

     Increased use of open-source architectures can speci cally bene t sectors characterized by the
     presence of SMEs that often lack the digital capacities and skills to collect or analyze data, thus
     tend to use to providers with attractive pricing like AWS or Azure. It's a trade-o really: Control for
     convenience.

     It is not a must to trade in your data ownership for a service when using open-source. Especially
     in manufacturing, agriculture, and construction, where access to performance data from industrial
     equipment opens opportunities for optimizing operational cycles and supply chain management,
     high-quality data is vital, and a data-ownership is one of the most important factors to this. In
     these environments, open-source-systems can enhance resilience by mitigating the high level of
     fragmentation currently found in data silos and addressing the absence of standards for technical
     interoperability.
