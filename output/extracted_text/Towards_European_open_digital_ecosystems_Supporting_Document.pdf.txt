           1. Positioning and scope
           This document accompanies the Call for Evidence submission on European
           open digital ecosystems.
           It is provided from the perspective of an independent expert focusing on
           governance, deployment, and operational integration of digital and AI-based
           systems.
           The document does not advocate specific technologies, platforms, or business
           models.
           Instead, it aims to clarify structural and operational conditions under which
           open digital ecosystems can be sustainable, trustworthy, and deployable at
           scale.

           2. Open ecosystems: benefits and practical limits
           Open digital ecosystems offer clear benefits, including reduced lock-in,
           increased transparency, and greater interoperability potential.
           However, deployment experience shows that openness alone does not
           guarantee effective adoption.
           In practice, the main obstacles arise not from access to code or interfaces, but
           from:

                 unclear allocation of responsibilities,

                 insufficient lifecycle governance,

                 fragmented interpretations across organisations and jurisdictions.

           Without addressing these issues, openness can paradoxically increase
           operational and legal risk.

           3. Governance as an enabling layer
           Governance should be understood as an enabling layer, not as a restriction on
           innovation.

           Well-designed governance mechanisms:

                 increase predictability for deployers,

                 clarify accountability across actors,

                 support trust in multi-actor environments.

           In open ecosystems, governance-by-design is a prerequisite for reuse and
           scalability.
           Where governance is absent or implicit, organisations tend to revert to closed
           or proprietary solutions to manage risk.

           4. Lifecycle governance and system evolution
           Digital and AI-based systems in open ecosystems are rarely static.

           Common forms of evolution include:

                 configuration changes,

                 updates and patches,

                 retraining or fine-tuning,

                 contextual reuse across sectors or functions.

           Governance frameworks should therefore operate across the full lifecycle, not
           only at the point of initial deployment or market entry.

           Clear mechanisms for documenting changes, monitoring impact, and
           reassessing responsibilities are essential to ensure continuity without
           overburdening actors.

           5. Change management and substantial modification

           The concept of substantial modification is particularly relevant in open digital
           ecosystems.

           Frequent change does not necessarily imply increased risk.
           However, changes that alter the risk profile, decision-making role, or affected
           population require proportionate reassessment.

           Operational clarity on:

                 thresholds for reassessment,

                 responsibility shifts between actors,

                 interaction with existing compliance frameworks

           is critical to avoid both under-reporting and excessive administrative burden.

           6. Interoperability beyond technical standards
           Interoperability should be considered across multiple dimensions:

                 technical,

                 legal,

                 organisational,

                 institutional.

           Technical standards alone are insufficient if responsibilities, escalation paths,
           and governance expectations differ across actors or Member States.
           Institutional interoperabilityâshared understanding of roles and obligationsâis
           therefore a key condition for durable open ecosystems.

           7. Public sector and multi-actor deployment
           Public sector adoption highlights both the potential and the fragility of open
           digital ecosystems.

           Public deployments typically involve:

                 procurement constraints,

                 audit and accountability requirements,

                 long operational lifecycles.

           In these contexts, maintainable openness is more important than theoretical
           openness.
           Clear governance frameworks help ensure continuity, auditability, and
           responsible reuse over time.

           8. Concluding remarks
           European open digital ecosystems represent a strategic opportunity.

           Their success depends not only on openness of technologies, but on clarity of
           governance, lifecycle accountability, and structured flexibility.
           Focusing EU-level action on these enabling conditions can support scalable,
           trustworthy and resilient digital ecosystems without constraining innovation.
