Strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector
The EU opensource sector benefits from strong collaboration, alignment with EU values, and a
need for digital sovereignty. These strengths are particularly relevant for grid operators like
Enexis, Alliander and Stedin, which depend on resilient, interoperable, and secure digital
infrastructure. Core opensource technologies such as Linux, Kubernetes, and PostgreSQL form
the backbone of digital landscape. Collaboration through foundations like LF Energy has
enabled the codevelopment of sectorcritical open-source systems (including Power Grid Model,
OpenSTEF, and CoMPAS) reducing duplication, enhancing transparency, and accelerated
innovation across the energy system.

However, the ecosystem faces notable issues:
â¢ Chronic underinvestment in open-source systems, leading to maintenance and sustainability
risks
â¢ Limited awareness and availability of open-source alternatives for critical systems
â¢ Incompatible tendering favoring proprietary solutions, reinforcing vendor lock-in

These issues increase dependency on proprietary solutions, hinder the modernization of digital
grid systems, and slow down transitions toward open, interoperable alternatives.

Added value of open source
Open-source reduces cost, lowers vendor lock-in, and strengthens digital sovereignty. Its open
and community-driven nature improve security through faster vulnerability detection and
remediation, while shared R&D accelerates innovation.

CoMPAS, an openâsource project for automated substation configuration, demonstrates these
benefits in practice. It enables grid operators to create substation configurations independent of
manufacturers. Proprietary tools lock operators into closed ecosystems, forcing them to
maintain multiple incompatible systems. CoMPAS reduces these inefficiencies, supports
collaboration, strengthens security oversight, and provides predictable, transparent
requirements for manufacturers.

EUâlevel measures to strengthen technological sovereignty and
cybersecurity
The EU must adopt a systemic, end-to-end view of digital dependencies. Open-source software
alone does not guarantee digital sovereignty if critical layers, such as hosting, cloud, compute,
and operational control, remain under non-EU influence. Digital sovereignty should not imply
building internally but ensuring that organizations retain effective governance, oversight, and
decision-making power over the digital systems on which society depends.

EUâlevel support should prioritize the following:
   1. Openâsourceâfirst procurement. Align procurement frameworks to prefer openâsource
      solutions, ensure consistent regulatory guidance, and direct investment toward
      sovereign EU openâsource based services.

   2. Reduce structural dependencies. Ensure credible substitution paths to open-source
      alternatives for essential systems, especially in critical sectors.

   3. A risk-based roadmap for adoption of open-source. Prioritize open-source adoption in
      critical systems first, where resilience and security gains are highest. Scale capability
      across the EU through skills development, training, and organizational structures (e.g.
      OSPOâs).

Priority technology areas
The EU should prioritize foundational technology domains where dependencies create systemic
risk:

   â¢   Open-source cloud and edge infrastructure
   â¢   Open-source AI and shared data infrastructures
   â¢   Critical sectoral technologies (e.g. open-source grid and energy system software)

Sectors where OSS boosts competitiveness and cyber resilience
â¢ Energy: Interoperable, vendorâindependent open-source tools strengthen the resilience and
sovereignty of critical energy infrastructure.

â¢Cloud & edge: Open platforms reduce dependence on nonâEU cloud and edge providers and
create growth opportunities for European alternatives.

â¢ AI: Open, trustworthy openâsource AI models support compliance with EU regulatory and
ethical standards.
