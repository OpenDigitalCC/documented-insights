Introduction

In the name of Private.coffee, we would like to thank the European Commission for
the opportunity to participate in this Call for Evidence. Private.coffee is an Austrian
non-profit association dedicated to promoting privacy and digital sovereignty of indi-
viduals, organizations, and public institutions. Open source software and hardware,
as well as open standards, in our view, are essential components in achieving this
mission.

Unfortunately, the IT landscape in Europe is still dominated by proprietary solutions
from a small number of large foreign corporations, primarily from the United States.
This leads to a lack of transparency, limited user control over their data, and a
technical, economical and political dependency on those international corporations,
and, by extension, on the governments of the countries where these corporations are
based. In a world where digital technologies have become an integral part of our
daily lives, where user privacy and data protection are under constant attack, and
where geopolitical tensions pose real risks to the security and sovereignty of nations,
open source solutions are more important than ever.

Private.coffee is involved in various open source projects and initiatives. We use open
source software extensively in our operations, contribute to open source projects,
provide infrastructure for open source communities, support users and organiza-
tions in adopting open source solutions, and develop our own open source tools and
applications. As such, we have a deep understanding of the open source ecosystem
from various perspectives: as users, contributors, maintainers, and advocates.

In this response, we will address the questions posed in the Call for Evidence, hoping
that our insights and experiences will contribute to shaping a more open, transpar-
ent, and user-centric digital future for Europe.

                                          3
Questions

To reiterate, the Commission asked for feedback on the following questions:

1.What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source sector? What are
  the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-quality and
  secure open source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open-source communities?

2.What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
  provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in, se-
  curity, innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added
  value.

3.What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
  development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUs
  technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

4.What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

5.In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased competi-
  tiveness and cyber resilience?

In the following sections, we will provide our detailed responses to each of these
questions.

1       Strengths and Weaknesses of the EU Open-Source
        Sector

Europe has a rich history of open source development. We are a diverse continent
with many talented developers, researchers, companies and grassroots organizations
contributing to open source projects. In fact, several core technologies without which
the internet as we know it would not exist today, such as the Linux kernel1,2 , the
MySQL/MariaDB database systems3,4 , the Python programming language5,6 , and,
indeed, the World Wide Web itself7 , were all created in the EU and its neighboring
countries. And currently, a large number of successful open source projects in direct
competition with privacy-invasive U.S. platforms are being developed predominantly
in Europe, such as Nextcloud8 , Mastodon9 , CryptPad10 , PeerTube11 , and so many
more.

Unfortunately, we have allowed multinational corporations from outside Europe to
dominate the IT landscape. The PC operating system market is clearly dominated
by Microsoft Windows, with Linux-based operating systems at a single-digit mar-
ket share12 , while the mobile operating system market essentially only consists of
Googleâs Android (which is technically an open source project, but in practice is
deeply reliant on proprietary components provided by Google) and Appleâs iOS.13
Most people use Google Chrome or Apple Safari as their web browsers, with Mozilla
Firefox, an open source project also based in the United States, trailing far behind.14

The cloud computing market is dominated by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft
Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.15 Metaâs WhatsApp has become synonymous
with instant messaging. And even where software is developed and hosted in Europe,
it is oftentimes put behind Cloudflare or other CDNs operated by non-European
companies.16

In the case of the search engine market, the situation is concerning for an addi-
tional reason. If Google Search has a market share of 90%17 , that means that it can
effectively control what information people can find online. This gives Google an
unprecedented level of influence over public opinion, political discourse, and even
democratic processes. Paired with the fact that Google makes its money primarily
through targeted advertising based on user data, this creates a dangerous situa-
tion where a single corporation can manipulate public opinion for profit, while also
infringing on user privacy and data protection.

All this is certainly not for lack of talent or innovation in Europe. Much rather, it
is a consequence of systemic issues, exacerbated by the dominance of multi-billion
dollar corporations that can afford to lobby governments18 and create ecosystems
that lock users in.

Overcoming these systemic issues will require coordinated efforts from governments,
the private sector, and civil society. We need to create an environment in which
open source projects can thrive. Unfortunately, far too often, open source projects
in Europe struggle to find sustainable funding, attract and retain developers and
contributors, and gain visibility and recognition. Even proprietary software compa-
nies often rely heavily on open source components, but there is a lack of awareness
and appreciation for the actual value generated by open source projects.

A great advantage of the EU open-source sector is the strong emphasis on privacy
and data protection. With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and

other privacy-focused regulations, Europe has set high standards for user privacy
and data protection. This creates a favorable environment for open source projects
that prioritize user privacy and data protection, as users and organizations are in-
creasingly looking for alternatives to software and services that collect and monetize
user data. We have a strong community of privacy-conscious developers and users
who are committed to creating and promoting open source solutions that respect
user privacy and data sovereignty. To this end, we would like to stress that the
GDPR is an important asset for the European IT sector in general, and the open
source sector in particular, so we urge the Commission to continue defending and
strengthening it, instead of bowing to pressure from multinational corporations to
weaken it, especially in the context of "Artificial Intelligence" or other buzzwords.
Privacy is a basic human right, and if business models are incompatible with that
right, we should respond by reexamining the business models, not by weakening
peopleâs rights.

There is also a prevalent misconception that open source software is inherently less
secure than proprietary software, since its source code is publicly available and can
be inspected by anyone, including potential attackers. However, this is a fallacy.
In reality, open source software can be more secure than proprietary software, as
it allows for greater transparency, peer review, and collaboration among developers
and security experts. Many eyes can scrutinize the code, identify vulnerabilities, and
contribute to fixing them. Proprietary software, on the other hand, relies on security
through obscurity, which can lead to complacency and a false sense of security.

Many open source projects are developed and maintained by volunteers or small
teams, which can lead to challenges in terms of resources, time, and expertise.
Without proper funding and support, it can be difficult to ensure that open source
projects remain up-to-date, secure, and compatible with evolving technologies and
standards.

Finally, where there is funding available for open source projects, it is often focused
on initial development and implementation, rather than availability, maintenance
and long-term sustainability. Open source projects are more than just the develop-
ment of code, or the design of hardware schematics. They require ongoing main-
tenance, security updates, documentation, user support, community building, and
other activities that are essential for their success and longevity. Funding models
that prioritize initial development over long-term sustainability can lead to a pro-

                                          7
liferation of abandoned or poorly maintained projects, and to feature creep as new
features are added in an attempt to attract more funding, instead of focusing on sta-
bility, security, usability, or, especially in the case of web services, actual long-term
hosting and operations.

                                           8
2     Added Value of Open Source for the Public and
      Private Sectors

2.1    More Security through Transparency

Open source offers several advantages for both the public and private sectors. First
and foremost, open source principles promote transparency and accountability. Users
can inspect the source code or schematics, understand how a product or service
works, and verify that it does not contain any hidden backdoors or malicious func-
tionalities. This is particularly important for public sector organizations that handle
particularly sensitive data and need to ensure that their citizensâ data is protected.
It allows interested individuals, organizations, security experts and researchers to
examine the code or schematics for vulnerabilities, bugs, or malicious functionality,
contribute to its improvement, and ensure that it meets the high standards one
would expect from components used in critical applications.

One example that comes to mind is a recent supply chain attack through the widely
used compression library liblzma. In 2024, a malicious maintainer inserted a back-
door into the library which was designed to interfere with secure SSH connections.
Thanks to the open source nature of the library, users who noticed performance
issues were able to inspect the source code, identify the backdoor, and have it re-
moved quickly19,20 . Had this been proprietary software, such reverse engineering
would have been much more difficult, if not impossible, and the backdoor could
have remained undetected for a long time, potentially compromising the security of
countless systems.

2.2    Increased Interoperability

Open source also allows for greater standardization and interoperability between
different systems and applications, between different vendors, government agencies,
public and private sector organizations, and even between different countries. This
can lead to cost savings, as it reduces redundancy and duplication of efforts.

2.3    Fostering Innovation

Open knowledge is also a great foundation for innovation. Instead of having to rein-
vent the wheel, existing open source projects can be used as a trusted and tested
basis for new development. Sharing knowledge and expanding on the work of oth-
ers is how scientific research and technological progress have always worked. Open
source projects allow for rapid prototyping, experimentation, and iteration, as devel-
opers can build on top of existing codebases, schematics, libraries, and frameworks,
instead of starting from scratch. This can lead to faster development cycles, reduced
costs, and a more diverse IT ecosystem.

In fact, that is an advantage that even multinational corporations recognize. For
example, Metaâs WhatsApp messaging platform is based on the open standard
XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), extended into a proprietary
"FunXMPP" format 21 . By leveraging an existing open standard, WhatsApp was
able to focus on building the user experience, scalability, and ecosystem around the
core messaging functionality, instead of having to develop and maintain a propri-
etary messaging protocol from scratch. Similarly, Instagram and Threads are based
on Django, an open source web framework written in Python. This way, Meta could
leverage the existing ecosystem of Django libraries, tools, and community support
to accelerate development and reduce costs.22

An open source stack provides greater flexibility and adaptability to changing needs
and requirements. Organizations can customize and modify open source software
to fit their specific use cases, workflows, and business processes. And it reduces the
dependency on a single vendor or supplier anyone can contribute to the development
and maintenance of open source software, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and
secure, even if the original developers or maintainers are no longer available.

2.4    Improved Repairability

Of course, open source hardware and software lead to improved repairability and
longevity of devices and systems. When the schematics and source code are openly
available, users and organizations can repair, upgrade, and maintain their devices
and systems for longer periods of time, reducing electronic waste and promoting
sustainability. Where the original manufacturer goes out of business or discontinues
support for a product, the community can step in to provide ongoing maintenance
and support. Of course, this is no substitute for manufacturers designing products
with repairability and longevity in mind from the very beginning, but open source
hardware and software can certainly help mitigate some of the negative effects of
planned obsolescence.

2.5    Open Source as a Tool of Democracy

Finally, open source software, paired with open government data shared in open
formats using open interfaces, can lead to greater transparency of government op-
erations and decision-making processes. Citizens can evaluate how public funds
are being used, monitor government activities, and hold public officials account-
able. This can lead to increased trust in government institutions and more citizen
engagement in democratic processes.

                                        11
3     Measures to Support the EU Open-Source Sec-
      tor

One very important aspect that needs to be addressed is awareness. Many people,
including decision-makers in public and private sector organizations, just do not
realize the extent to which they are dependent on proprietary software, and the
risks that this entails. Education and awareness campaigns are needed to inform
users, organizations, and governments about questions of digital sovereignty, data
protection, security, and the benefits of open source software. This includes critical
examination in schools, universities, and professional training programs, as well
as public awareness campaigns and outreach initiatives. To that end, the public
education sector should always prioritize open source solutions over effectively selling
proprietary software to their students. In fact, financing and support for open source
initiatives in itself can be a great way to generate and retain know-how and expertise
in the respective fields, fostering European innovation and technological sovereignty
and reducing dependencies on foreign suppliers.

As a first step towards supporting the development and growth of the EU open-
source sector, we recommend the establishment of a dedicated EU Open Source
Authority. This authority would be responsible for coordinating and promoting
open source initiatives across Europe, providing funding and resources for open
source projects, and serving as a central hub for information and collaboration among
open source communities.

It could also serve as a central point of contact for public and private sector organiza-
tions seeking to adopt open source solutions, providing guidance, best practices, and
technical support. Tasked with evaluating the current tech stack used by EU insti-
tutions and agencies, as well as by member states, it could identify opportunities for
replacing proprietary software with open source alternatives. Where currently insti-
tutions and member states spend significant portions of their IT budgets on licensing
fees for proprietary software, such funds could instead be used for supporting and
maintaining open source solutions, making any required customizations, training
staff, financing bug bounty programs, and ensuring long-term sustainability.

Open source software should also be prioritized in public procurement processes.
Where governments and public sector organizations issue tenders for software so-

                                           12
lutions, open source options should be given preference, provided they meet the
required technical and security standards. And where custom software development
is required, the resulting software - paid for by public funds - should be released
under an open source license, allowing others to benefit from it and contribute to
its improvement. Of course, priority should also be given to European projects
and initiatives, such that European taxpayer money is used to support European
innovation and technological sovereignty.

Additionally, we recommend the establishment of a permanent EU Open Source
Fund. This fund would provide grants and financial support to open source projects
and initiatives. Open source projects often fly under the radar, especially smaller
projects, like libraries and frameworks, that are critical components of the software
ecosystem but may not receive much attention or funding. The fund could support
a wide range of activities, including development, maintenance, operations, docu-
mentation, community building, security audits, and outreach, ensuring that open
source projects have the resources they need to thrive and grow. It is critical that
the people in charge of allocating these funds have a deep understanding of the open
source ecosystem, and are able to evaluate projects based on their technical merits,
community engagement, and long-term sustainability, free from political or corpo-
rate influence. Trusted members of the open source community should be involved
in the decision-making process to ensure that funds are allocated effectively and
transparently.

It is important to add that open source projects are not restrained by geographical
boundaries. While we believe that European open source projects should be pri-
oritized in public procurement processes, funding should not be limited to projects
(legally) based in Europe. Many open source projects are developed and maintained
by global communities, and restricting funding to strictly "European" projects, peo-
ple and organizations could lead to the exclusion of valuable contributions from
outside Europe. Instead, we should focus on supporting open source projects that
align with European values and principles, regardless of their geographical origin.

Finally, as a kind of wishful thinking, we would like to see stronger antitrust en-
forcement against multinational tech corporations that dominate the IT landscape
in Europe. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA)
are steps in the right direction, but more needs to be done to break up tech monop-
olies and promote competition and innovation. This includes measures to prevent

                                         13
anti-competitive practices and privacy invasions, as well as active efforts to require
real interoperability and open standards. Furthermore, as a protection for open
source developers, there must be a clear legal basis allowing reverse engineering of
proprietary solutions for the purpose of achieving interoperability with open source
solutions, as well as for security research and expanding the life span of "abandoned"
software and systems.

                                         14
4        Technology Areas to be Prioritized

It is our belief that open source solutions should be prioritized in all technology areas,
as open source principles of transparency, collaboration, and user empowerment are
universally applicable and beneficial. We would still like to highlight a few specific
areas where open source solutions can have a particularly significant impact.

4.1       Critical Infrastructure

From a public sector perspective, we believe that particular emphasis should be
placed on critical infrastructure, including the systems of governmental bodies,
healthcare systems, energy grids, transportation networks, and communication sys-
tems. These sectors are vital to the functioning of society and the economy, and
any vulnerabilities or geopolitical dependencies in these sectors could have severe
consequences on the safety, security, and well-being of citizens. Open source projects
ensure that the software and infrastructure used in these sectors is transparent, se-
cure, and resilient, as it allows for greater scrutiny, peer review, and collaboration
among developers and security experts, and prevents individual vendors from having
undue influence or control over critical systems.

4.2       Democracy

For the civil society, we believe that open source solutions should be prioritized in
the areas of privacy and data protection, digital rights, and civic engagement. Open
source software empowers individuals and organizations to take control of their own
data and digital identities, protecting them from corporate and government surveil-
lance, censorship, and manipulation. Open source tools for secure communication,
data encryption, identity management, and digital activism are essential for safe-
guarding fundamental rights and freedoms in the digital age.

At Private.coffee, we operate a number of open source projects that align with this
civil society focus. This includes services like Matrix23 , an open standard and pro-
tocol for secure, decentralized communication, CryptPad24 , a privacy-focused online
  23

collaboration platform, or Mastodon25 , a decentralized social networking platform.
We also provide infrastructure and support for various other open source projects
and communities that promote privacy, digital sovereignty, and user empowerment.
And there are many initiatives across Europe that focus on similar goals, providing
valuable, albeit often overlooked, services to their communities. A focus on sup-
porting and promoting these projects is essential if we want to build a more resilient
digital ecosystem in Europe, prioritizing user privacy, data protection, and digital
rights.

4.3    Tools for Developers

Currently, much of the software development ecosystem is dominated by proprietary
tools and platforms, such as integrated development environments (IDEs), version
control systems, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools, and cloud
computing platforms, even in the open source community itself. As an example,
GitHub, owned by Microsoft, is the largest code hosting platform in the world,
hosting hundreds of millions of open source projects.26

Open source alternatives are available for many of these tools, such as Forgejo27
as an open source alternative to GitHub. However, small projects often lack the
resources and expertise to set up and maintain their own infrastructure, leading
to a reliance on proprietary platforms. By prioritizing not only the development
of code, but also the development, maintenance and operation of open source tools
and platforms for developers, we can create a more accessible and equitable software
development ecosystem, reducing dependencies on proprietary tools and platforms.

5    Increased Competitiveness and Cyber Resilience

There are several factors that lead to increased competitiveness and cyber resilience
through the use of open source software in essentially all sectors. It is much easier -
and more cost-effective - to adapt open source software to specific needs and require-
ments, as the source code is freely available and can be modified without restrictions.
Instead of being tied to the roadmap and priorities of a proprietary software ven-
dor, organizations can take control of their own software stack, customize it to their
needs, and innovate on top of it. This way, software can be tailored to specific
use cases, workflows, and business processes, eliminating unnecessary features and
bloat and improving user experience. It also removes the threat of vendor lock-in,
as organizations are not dependent on a single vendor for updates, support, or new
features.

Even where companies currently offer proprietary software solutions, changing their
business models to open source can lead to increased competitiveness, expanding the
potential customer base. Support level agreements, custom development, training,
and consulting services can provide sustainable revenue streams, while the open
source nature of the software can lead to greater adoption and market penetration.

Many fields are currently dominated by a few large corporations, leading to monop-
olies or oligopolies that stifle competition and innovation. For example, the online
video streaming market is dominated by YouTube, owned by Alphabet (i.e. Google),
which controls a vast majority of the market share. And Amazon is so dominant
in the e-commerce sector that it has become all but impossible for smaller players
to compete, not only online, but also in the physical retail space. Decentralized,
federated open source solutions could enable the creation of a network of smaller,
independent platforms that can interoperate with each other, allowing manufactur-
ers and retailers to reach customers directly and offer their products and services
on their own terms, without being dependent on a single dominant platform or
marketplace which can dictate terms and conditions.

As already mentioned, open source software can provide greater transparency and
security, as vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed more quickly through commu-
nity collaboration. Especially in critical infrastructure sectors, the simple fact that
security researchers and experts can inspect the source code can ensure that po-
tential vulnerabilities are discovered and addressed before they can be exploited by

                                          17
malicious actors. While this may seem counterintuitive to some, security through
obscurity is not a viable long-term strategy, and open source software provides a
much more robust and resilient approach to cybersecurity. It replaces the need for
trust in a vendor and their supply chains with public verifiability and the scrutiny
of many.

We live in an age where not only the threat of individual and state-sponsored hackers
is ever-present, but where geopolitical tensions can lead to real risks for the security
and sovereignty of nations. Just consider the case of U.S. sanctions against officials
of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which led to ICC staff being cut off from
cloud services provided by Microsoft, including email. In response, the ICC decided
to move away from proprietary cloud services and switch to openDesk, an open
source, self-hosted collaboration platform.28

This example illustrates how important it is for governments and public sector or-
ganizations to be in control of their own software and data. Almost on a daily basis,
we see how alliances that we once took for granted are breaking down, and as sad-
dening as that is, we must see this as a wake-up call to prioritize digital sovereignty
and resilience. Open source software is a key component in achieving this goal, as it
allows us to build systems that are transparent, secure, and under our own control.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we believe that open source software and hardware, and the adoption
of open standards and publication of open data, are essential for building a more
open, transparent, and user-centric digital future for Europe. They protect us from
risks like vendor lock-in, monopolies, geopolitical dependencies, privacy intrusions,
security vulnerabilities, anti-consumer practices, and much more.

To realize the full potential of open source in Europe, we need coordinated efforts
from governments, the private sector, and civil society. This includes raising aware-
ness about the benefits of open source, prioritizing open source solutions in public
procurement processes, providing sustainable funding for open source projects, and
enforcing antitrust regulations against the multinational tech corporations that cur-
rently dominate the IT landscape.

With a strong focus on privacy and a collaborative spirit, the EU has the potential
to become a global leader in open source innovation. For this to happen, we need
a clear commitment to those principles at all levels, and the European Commission
can play a guiding role in this endeavor.

In particular, we ask the Commission to consider the following recommendations:

â¢Establish an EU Open Source Authority to coordinate and promote open source
 initiatives across Europe, and guide public sector procurement.

â¢Create a permanent EU Open Source Fund to provide grants and financial support
 to open source projects and initiatives.

â¢Prioritize open source solutions in public procurement processes, giving preference
 to European projects and initiatives.

â¢Strengthen antitrust enforcement against multinational tech corporations that
 dominate the IT landscape in Europe.

â¢Continue defending and strengthening the GDPR and other privacy-focused reg-
 ulations.

â¢Raise awareness about the benefits of open source through education and public
 awareness campaigns.

We would like to take the opportunity to thank the European Commission once
again for allowing us to contribute to this important discussion. We are glad to see
that open source is being recognized as a key component of Europeâs digital future,
and we look forward to seeing the Commission and member states take concrete
actions to support and promote the open source community in the future.

Of course, we are always available for further discussions and clarifications, and
invite the Commission, and any other interested parties, to reach out to us at any
time.
