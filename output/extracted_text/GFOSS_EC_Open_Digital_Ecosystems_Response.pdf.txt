       Response to the European Commission Call for Evidence
                  Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems

Submitted by: Open Technologies Alliance (GFOSS)
Country: Greece
Respondent type: Non-profit organisation (consortium of 37 universities and research
centres)
Date: February 2026

Summary
GFOSS welcomes this consultation as a critical opportunity to address structural challenges
in European open source ecosystems. As Greece's national open source alliance - backed
by 37 universities and research centres and operating since 2008 - we bring a distinctive
perspective: that of a Member State with sophisticated digital governance platforms built on
open source (such as gov.gr, diavgeia.gov.gr, opengov.gr and mitos.gov.gr) yet with minimal
public and private sector contribution to open source commons. This paradox illuminates
why the Commission's initiative must address institutional architecture equally to technical
capacity.

We strongly endorse the EU Sovereign Tech Fund (EU-STF) proposal developed by
OpenForum Europe and partners. Much of Europe's digital infrastructure depends on open
source software, yet chronic under-investment in maintaining and securing these shared
resources has increased systemic exposure to risk, leaving governments, businesses, and
citizens vulnerable to security threats, supply chain disruptions, and vendor lock-in. The EU-
STF provides the essential funding mechanism this strategy requires.

Our response emphasises that technical proficiency does not automatically translate to
ecosystem participation. Deliberate institutional design determines whether Member States
contribute to or merely consume from digital commons.

1. Strengths and Weaknesses of the EU Open Source Sector

Strengths
Developer talent pool: The EU hosts one of the world's largest communities of open source
developers. As the Commission itself acknowledges in this consultation, Europe has "a very
active and rich ecosystem of communities of open-source developers, among the largest
worldwide." However, much of the economic value generated by these communities flows
outside the EU, often benefiting tech giants elsewhere.

Mature policy frameworks in leading states: France, Germany, and Italy have developed
comprehensive institutional architectures. France's DINUM (Direction InterministÃ©rielle du
NumÃ©rique) coordinates open source strategy across ministries; Germany's ZenDiS
(Zentrum fÃ¼r Digitale SouverÃ¤nitÃ¤t) and Sovereign Tech Agency provide centralised
coordination; Italy's Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale establishes legal mandates.

Regulatory leadership: The Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act create conditions
favouring interoperability and open standards. The Cyber Resilience Act's treatment of open
source, while initially concerning, has evolved through constructive dialogue.

Emerging coordination mechanisms: EDICs (European Digital Infrastructure Consortia)
for digital commons signal commitment to collective infrastructure investment.

Weaknesses
Fragmentation across Member States: A fundamental asymmetry exists between
countries with developed institutional architecture (France, Germany, Italy) and those
consuming open source without contributing (including Greece, despite sophisticated e-
government platforms). This is not primarily a technical capacity gap but an institutional
design gap.

Procurement barriers: Public procurement frameworks in many Member States neither
require open source consideration nor mandate upstream contribution when open source is
deployed. This transforms governments into consumers rather than ecosystem contributors.

Chronic maintenance underfunding: As the EU-STF feasibility study documents, critical
open source infrastructure is maintained by overstretched teams with inadequate resources,
creating systemic security and sustainability risks. Left unattended, these foundational
technologies will remain severely underfunded, exposing European governments,
businesses, and citizens to security threats and supply chain vulnerabilities.

Barriers to Adoption and Sustainable Contribution
Absence of coordinating bodies: Many Member States lack equivalents to France's
DINUM or Germany's ZenDiS. Without institutional coordination, individual platform
deployments remain isolated rather than part of a wider ecosystem-building.

No legal mandate for consideration: Unlike Italy's 'comply or explain' framework most
Member States have no legal requirement to evaluate open source alternatives or justify
proprietary choices.

Procurement without contribution requirements: Contracts deploying open source rarely
require contractors to upstream modifications. This institutionalises consumption without
reciprocity.

Private sector incentive misalignment: Without procurement signals, training pipelines, or
tax incentives, companies lack commercial motivation to invest in open source contribution.

2. Added Value of Open Source
For the Public Sector
Vendor independence and continuity: France's Gendarmerie migration to Linux, one of
the largest public sector desktop deployments in Europe, demonstrates that open source
enables continuity independent of vendor decisions.

Interoperability and data portability: Open standards embedded in open source solutions
prevent data lock-in. Greece's MITOS interoperability framework relies on open source
infrastructure, though benefits remain unrealised due to limited ecosystem contribution.

Security through transparency: Publicly auditable code enables collective security review.
The Cyber Resilience Act's recognition of open source security practices validates this
model.

Total cost of ownership: Beyond licensing savings, open source reduces switching costs
and enables aggregated support contracts across ministries. France's inter-ministerial
support contracts (serving 13+ ministries through unified procurement) demonstrate
efficiency gains.

For the Private Sector
Innovation acceleration: Building on open source components accelerates development
cycles. The EU's own estimates suggest 70-90% of code in digital systems incorporates
open source.

Talent attraction: Companies contributing to open source attract developers who value
collaborative development practices. This creates competitive advantage in tight labour
markets.

Commercial ecosystem development: France's many years of institutional investment and
Germany's recent strategic initiatives (ZenDiS, Sovereign Tech Fund) demonstrate that
supportive policy frameworks enable sustainable open source business models.

Critical Assessment Factors
In evaluating open source value, we recommend prioritising: (1) Strategic autonomy - ability
to maintain and modify systems independent of external actors; (2) Ecosystem sustainability
- whether deployment contributes to or merely consumes from commons; (3) Knowledge
retention - whether expertise accumulates within Europe or leaks to external contractors; (4)
Security auditability - capacity for independent verification of system integrity.

3. Recommended EU-Level Measures

Priority 1: Establish the EU Sovereign Tech Fund
GFOSS strongly endorses the EU-STF proposal. Now is the time to be proactive rather than
reactive - to invest in the open digital infrastructure that powers European innovation and
technological capabilities before the next crisis.

Building on the proven success of Germany's Sovereign Tech Agency, a pan-European fund
would address chronic maintenance underfunding in critical open source infrastructure.
OpenForum Europe's feasibility study, published in July 2025, demonstrates that targeted
public investment of at least â¬350 million over seven years could be a starting point for
securing these critical foundations.

While the mission-driven funding should be led by the public sector, it must also marshal a
whole-of-society approach, bringing together the collective efforts of EU Member States,
industry, SMEs, and civil society to sustain and secure our open digital infrastructure.

Without such investment, Europe risks the stagnation of its entire digital agenda,
undermining the EU's Digital Decade targets, the Cyber Resilience Act, and broader
competitiveness goals. We urge the Commission to include EU-STF establishment as a
centrepiece of this strategy.

Longer-term vision: Beyond the immediate establishment of the EU-STF, the Commission
should develop a European Critical Open Source Strategy (COSS) ensuring the sovereignty,
security, and maintenance of foundational open source libraries and platforms used across
the EU. This could evolve toward a dedicated European Open Source Foundation with
sustained annual funding, building on the STF model to create permanent institutional
infrastructure for digital commons stewardship.

Priority 2: Procurement Reform with Contribution Requirements
The Commission should develop model procurement clauses requiring contractors deploying
open source to upstream modifications. Such requirements transform procurement from
consumption to ecosystem cultivation.

Cross-border demand aggregation: Coordinated procurement among major public sector
buyers would multiply the impact of procurement reform. Building on France's inter-
ministerial model and Germany's ZenDiS-coordinated approach, cross-border demand
aggregation among major Member States (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland) would
create a European-scale market signal for open source solutions, comparable to how US
federal procurement shapes its technology market. This demand consolidation would make
Europe an attractive market for open source vendors and incentivise ecosystem contribution.

Priority 3: Technical Assistance for Institutional Capacity Building
Many Member States lack institutional architecture for open source ecosystem development.
The Commission should establish technical assistance programmes helping countries create
OSPOs (Open Source Programme Offices), recommended software catalogues (following
France's SILL model), and communities of practice (following the BlueHats model).

Greece's Ministry of Digital Governance has expressed interest in OSPO establishment - EU
support would accelerate such initiatives across Member States lacking institutional
infrastructure.

Priority 4: Foundation Membership and Governance Support
European underrepresentation in foundation governance limits influence over critical
infrastructure development. The Commission should consider mechanisms supporting
European organisation membership in key foundations, potentially through matched funding
programmes or foundation liaison coordination.

Priority 5: Harmonised Legal Framework
Building on Italy's CAD model, the Commission should develop recommendations for
'comply or explain' frameworks requiring public bodies to evaluate open source alternatives
and document justification for proprietary choices. This creates accountability without rigid
mandates.

Priority 6: Mainstream Open Source in Flagship EU Digital Initiatives
The Commission should ensure that the open source and digital sovereignty dimension is
systematically integrated into existing and future EU flagship digital programmes:

EDICs (European Digital Infrastructure Consortia): Require that EDIC-funded
infrastructure prioritises open source solutions and contributes improvements back to
upstream communities.
EDIHs (European Digital Innovation Hubs): Mandate that EDIHs include open source
expertise and promote open source adoption among SMEs they support, with explicit KPIs
for ecosystem contribution.
GAIA-X: Strengthen open source requirements in GAIA-X federation services, ensuring that
European data infrastructure is built on transparent, auditable foundations rather than
proprietary dependencies. Set a target of 50% of Member State public services hosted on
sovereign, interoperable infrastructure within five years.
GÃANT: Leverage the research and education network's position to promote open source
networking tools and contribute to their development, building on existing open source
practices.
Europeana: Ensure that digital cultural heritage infrastructure remains built on open source
foundations, with active contribution to relevant communities.
European Schoolnet: Integrate open source educational technology into digital education
initiatives, reducing dependency on proprietary platforms in schools and building digital
literacy around open technologies.

This mainstreaming approach ensures that EU investment across digital programmes
reinforces rather than undermines open source ecosystem development, creating coherent
policy alignment across the Commission's digital agenda.

4. Technology Areas to Prioritise
AI and Large Language Models: European AI sovereignty requires open alternatives to
proprietary models. Initiatives like GFOSS's GlossAPI (building open Greek language
datasets for LLM development) demonstrate Member State-level efforts that could scale with
EU support. Language-specific AI capabilities are essential for preserving linguistic diversity.
The AI Act's compliance requirements should be positioned as a competitive advantage for
European AI development - open source AI models developed with open training data offer
inherent advantages in transparency and auditability that align with the Act's requirements.
An EU certification framework for trustworthy AI could become a global quality mark, similar
to CE marking for physical products.

Educational Platforms: Open source learning management systems (Moodle, OpenEdX)
reduce educational institution dependency on proprietary platforms.

Cloud Infrastructure: Open source cloud platforms (OpenStack, Kubernetes) provide
alternatives to hyperscaler dependency.

Cybersecurity Tooling: Security tools benefit from transparent, auditable code.

Digital Identity Infrastructure: eIDAS 2.0 implementation creates opportunities for open
source identity solutions. Interoperability requirements favour open standards embedded in
open source implementations.

Open Hardware Architectures: Digital sovereignty extends beyond software to the
hardware layer. EU investment in RISC-V and other open processor architectures for IoT,
edge computing, and high-performance computing would reduce dependence on closed
architectures controlled by non-European entities. The Chips Act provides a framework for
such investment, but explicit linkage to open hardware initiatives would strengthen European
technological autonomy at the foundational level.

5. Sectors for Increased Open Source Adoption
Public Administration: E-government platforms represent the most direct opportunity.
Greece's experience demonstrates that sophisticated platforms (Diavgeia transparency
portal, MITOS interoperability framework, gov.gr citizen services, opengov.gr public
deliberations) can be built on open source. The challenge is converting deployment into
ecosystem contribution.

Research and Education: Open science principles align naturally with open source
practices. Research infrastructure (data repositories, collaboration tools, computational
platforms) should default to open source.

Healthcare: Interoperability requirements for health data exchange favour open standards.
Open source health information systems reduce vendor lock-in while enabling local
adaptation.

Automotive: Software-defined vehicles increasingly rely on open source components.
Mercedes-Benz's public support for the EU-STF reflects industry recognition that sustainable
open source infrastructure benefits all participants.

Financial Services: Regulatory technology (RegTech) and payment infrastructure benefit
from transparent, auditable systems. Open source reduces systemic risks from proprietary
single points of failure.

6. Measurable Targets for 2030
To ensure accountability and track progress, we recommend the Commission establish
measurable targets aligned with the Digital Decade framework:

Market share: Significantly increase the share of European open source solutions in public
procurement.
Infrastructure sovereignty: 50% of Member State public services hosted on sovereign,
interoperable infrastructure based on open standards by 2030.
Institutional coverage: OSPOs or equivalent coordinating bodies established in all Member
States by 2028.
Foundation governance: European representation in major open source foundation boards
increased to reflect Europe's developer population share.
Contribution metrics: Tracking of upstream contributions from EU public sector and EU-
funded projects, with annual progress reporting.

Conclusion
Greece's experience offers both inspiration and warning. Î£ophisticated e-government
platforms demonstrate that open source can deliver citizen-facing services at scale. Yet the
absence of institutional architecture - no OSPO, no software catalogue, no procurement
requirements, no community cultivation - means this technical capacity generates no
ecosystem contribution.

France's success - built over two decades through DINUM, the SILL catalogue, BlueHats
communities, inter-ministerial support contracts, and systematic procurement reform - shows
what deliberate institutional construction achieves. Germany's rapid recent progress through
ZenDiS and the Sovereign Tech Fund demonstrates that determined action can accelerate
transformation.

The EU Sovereign Tech Fund represents essential commitment to open source
infrastructure sustainability. But funding alone is insufficient without the institutional
architecture to translate investment into lasting ecosystem development. We urge the
Commission to ensure this strategy addresses both dimensions: immediate funding through
the EU-STF, and longer-term institutional capacity building across all Member States.
Europe's digital autonomy and resilience depend on this dual approach.
