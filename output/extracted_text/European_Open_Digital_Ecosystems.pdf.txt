                                      European Open Digital Ecosystems

                                                      ***

    A. Using public procurement as a lever to promote the adop7on of European open-source solu7ons
    -   According to the European Commission, 70% to 90% of the code used in the digital economy relies on
        open-source components, but the economic value generated by these developments largely beneï¬ts
        non European players (European Commission, 12/01/26).

    -   This situaKon largely results from the network eï¬ects of major vendors, which create a structural barrier
        hindering European soluKons from entering public procurement markets, both in terms of winning
        contracts and accessing talent.
        Ã° Proposal: Leverage the revision of the Public Procurement DirecKve to introduce a European
          preference in public procurement, and promote purchasing policies that are not license centric in
          order to support European open-source soluKons.

    B. Ensuring sustainable funding for digital commons and European open-source actors
    -   The Commission highlights the absence of longterm, scalable funding mechanisms capable of supporKng
        European opensource projects beyond the research and prototyping phases, even though these digital
        commons consKtute strategic infrastructure essenKal for European sovereignty, security, and
        compeKKveness.
    -   According to Numeum, open source underpins 96% of soTware and generates up to 95 billion in annual
        economic impact across the EU. Despite this, it remains structurally underfunded, weakening Europes
        capacity to maintain technological autonomy (Numeum, 18/07/2025).
        Ã° Proposal: Establish mulK year funding mechanisms for digital commons, by contribuKng to the
          operaKon of exisKng structures, supporKng the creaKon of European level foundaKons, and
          strengthening the ecosystem of European contributors.

    C. Mobilizing opera7onal and regulatory levers to make open source a priority

    -   The Commission describes Europes dependence on non European technologies as a strategic handicap,
        weakening its compeKKveness, limiKng its decision making autonomy, and creaKng strategic
        vulnerabiliKes in cybersecurity and resilience.
    -   Therefore, operaKonal and regulatory levers should be used to make open source a priority: seYng up
        open data repositories to foster open-source soluKons in criKcal ï¬elds (data on climate, health, energy),
        developing interoperable standards at the European level, training high school and university students
        on open source soluKons, and more.
        Ã° Proposal: Adopt an open source ï¬rst policy aimed at prioriKzing projects or regulatory frameworks
          that favor the use of open source for strategic digital services when a European soluKon exists or
          could be developed.

About MAIF and open source:

As a mutual insurer commi[ed to maintaining control over its criKcal components, MAIF relieswhen relevanton
open-source soluKons and contributes to their development by open sourcing components of its informaKon
system.
MAIF adopts a pragmaKc strategy combining in house development for criKcal acKviKes, market soluKons for
other uses, and contribuKons to digital commons aligned with the European Commission objecKves for a more
sovereign, transparent, interoperable, and sustainable digital landscape.
