IBM feedback on the
European Commissionâs
Call for Evidence on an
Open Digital Ecosystem

IBM thanks the European Commission for the opportunity to provide input to the Call for
Evidence on an initiative âTowards European open digital ecosystemsâ. IBM has been a
strong supporter of the European Commissionâs Open Source strategy 2020-2023 and we
welcome the initiative to build on this and expand the focus towards an open digital
ecosystem.

IBM has been a long term advocate for open technologies and open infrastructures. This
includes our long history and strong commitment to open source which was further
strengthened with the acquisition of RedHat. IBM is an active and leading participant in
open source projects. IBM contributed to the foundations and success of leading open
source foundations like the Linux Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation and the Apache
Foundation. We regularly publish and donate key technologies to open source
addressing all leading edge technology developments, most recently in the fields of AI
and Quantum.

IBM also has a long history of high commitment and strong participation in to open
standards development. IBM is a leading member of European and global
standardisation organisations and contributes at both technical and governance level.
Open standards and open source are both key elements of open technologies and
should be considered in their interplay for reaping full benefits for an open digital
ecosystem.

Against this background we welcome the opportunity to share some thoughts on the
envisaged policy initiative for an open digital ecosystem focusing on the key aspects and
questions raised in the call for evidence.

The EU is a key player on
open technologies and open-source
Open source has been the main driving factor for innovation over the last decades. Open
source ecosystems nourish entrepreneurship and technology progress on a broad scale.
The EU has a very active and vivid open source sector with which IBM is connected and to
which IBM contributes broadly. It is worth noting that a large majority of all software
deployed in the EU today is already based on open source. A key indicator of the
importance of open source in Europe is also the fact that the second largest open
foundation of the world, the Eclipse Foundation, is based in Europe. Other Foundations
have very active and effective European chapters. Moreover, success stories like
FOSDEM, which is held annually in Brussels and is one of the most recognised Open
Source conferences in the world, further constitute the relevance of Open Source in
Europe and the impact of the European open source ecosystem.

The EU Open Source strategy 2020-2023 provided a very good and comprehensive
foundation for driving open source developments and the adoption in Europe. We
support the European Commissionâs perspective to build on this and expand the open
source strategy beyond what had been the scope so far. The principles outlined in the
Open Source strategy 2020-2023 are, in IBMâs mind, still valid and donât require
modification. In order to continue on this solid basis, we recommend that the European
Commission give clear support for the definition for what constitutes open source as
provided by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). This is important to avoid confusion with
other, non-Open-Source software developments and licenses when moving toward an
open digital ecosystem.

From our observation, the European Commissionâs Open Source strategy did have
positive effects in increasing the overall focus on open source. This includes the full
scope of positive effects, both economical as a driver for innovation and collaboration, as
well as at governance level, e.g. for enabling digital sovereignty. Many initiatives were
founded during the last decade embracing open source as the key development model.
These include areas like sustainability, digitisation of industry, the digital product
passport, automotive, dataspaces, etc.

Open Source is, by definition, a borderless and collaborative model that enables crowd-
sourced quality control and interoperability across platforms. This approach ensures
portability â allowing algorithms and applications, whether from a European provider or
elsewhere. Open innovation must remain global, collaborative, and interoperable by
design - avoiding geographic restrictions or lock-in that run counter to the principles of
open source. Therefore, as part of the open digital ecosystem strategy, actions should be
taken to encourage further participation of European players in open source
developments and refrain from trying to create borders (e.g. refrain from promoting EU
only developments) which would be contrary to the overall spirit and the innovative
global network effects of open source.

                                                                                          2
Adoption and maintenance of
high-quality and secure
open source and sustainable
contributions to open-source communities
Open Source developments take place in multiple ways. They may happen ad hoc, e.g.
with projects started on Open Source platforms which get traction and evolve into
important software developments. The usual way for industry, whether large or small, is
via initiating and contributing to Open Source projects managed under the governance of
Open Source Foundations like the Linux Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, the Apache
Foundation, and others. These provide for maintenance, quality, security, etc.

We recommend that the European Commission seeks partnership and interaction with
these foundations for the development of an effective strategy on open digital
ecosystems.

Added value of open source
for the public and private sectors
Open Source software provides choice and and control. It prevents vendor lock-in.

Reference and compatibility implementations in Open Source also reduce cost and effort
by making software available for everyone to use or build on. This, in particular, supports
SMEs in Europe who have an easier way via Open Source to benefit from and participate
in innovation.

In general, Open Source makes it easier for researchers, developers, governments, and
businesses to develop algorithms, simulate systems, and run experiments. IBM is
convinced that the amount of relevant innovations resulting from open source will
further increase.

                                                                                          3
Possible concrete measures
and actions at EU level
to support the development
and growth of the
EU open-source sector and
contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty
and cybersecurity agenda
Open Source is a foundational element for effectively promoting technological
sovereignty. The Openness and the ability of choice which Open Source provide are core
aspects for technological sovereignty.

Cybersecurity has been a key aspect in strong focus of Open Source developments. One
example are the activities in the Linux Foundations OpenSSF project which addresses
cybersecurity on a broad level and gives it continuous attention in Open Source projects
and developments. The European Commission and ENISA are already connected to these
activities. This interlock may be strengthened.

Overall, the European Commission should establish a coordinated and structured
interaction with the leading global Open Source foundations and organisations hosting
Open Source projects. Via such an interaction awareness and understanding for EU
policy needs and objectives should be created and ways for taking them into
consideration be sought and explored.

In addition, it is important for an effective open digital ecosystem and for leadership of
the EU in open digital technologies to have a much improved set up for IT
standardisation in Europe. The current structures are unclear as to where IT
standardisation is done which regularly results in competing efforts. Nor are the
processes available today favourable for effective IT standards development including
interaction with open source communities and enabling the easy and straight forwards
implementation of standards in open source. A distinct place and distinct process for
open digital standards development in Europe is needed.

Technology areas and
possible prioritisation
Open Source has overall been the major driving factor for innovation across multiple
sectors for more than 15 years. From an EU policy perspective, technology areas that are

                                                                                             4
of key strategic importance for Europe should increase their consideration and support
for Open Source. We recommend that this be done in close interaction with industry who
provide the bulk expertise to Open Source. Without good software developers from
industry a broad Open Source strategy will not be successful.

Sectors where an increased use
of open source could lead
to increased competitiveness
and cyber resilience
Digitisation is a central need for Europeâs competitiveness. Given the relevance Open
Source already has today regarding the actually deployed software in Europe, it must be
expected that this increases further and across all sectors. It is, therefore, hard to pick
individual sectors. It may even be counter-productive to reduce focus on specific sectors.
A broad approach is needed.

Concluding remarks
IBM welcomes the considerations about an initiative promoting open digital ecosystems.
We see strong potential that this can build on the European Commissionâs open source
strategy and at the same time continue it and bring it to a new level regarding the
awareness of open source and its potential and critical impact for innovation as well as
promote the participation in and adoption of open source technologies throughout
different sectors and organisations.

IBM is ready to support the European Commission on this path, drawing from our long
experience with and investment into open technologies. IBM believes that the benefits
from open digital ecosystems are huge and respond very much to current challenges and
technology needs. We are ready anytime for further exchanges on the topic.
