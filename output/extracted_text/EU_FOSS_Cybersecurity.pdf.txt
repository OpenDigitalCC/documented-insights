Executive Summary

This opinion paper addresses the European Commission's strategic objective of achieving digital sovereignty
through open-source technologies. Drawing on 20 years of experience as an individual developer of critical
cybersecurity infrastructure, I argue that the current EU funding and support frameworks suï¬er from an
"institutional blind spot" that favors commercial entities and startups over the individual developers who
maintain the worldâs most critical Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). To achieve true strategic autonomy, the
EU must shift its focus toward supporting the "unsexy" but foundational layers of the internetâsuch as ï¬rewalls
and SSL inspection toolsâand dismantle the closed-source ecosystems that currently dictate the European
cybersecurity landscape.

1. The Institutional Blind Spot: Why Individual Developers are the Forgotten Backbone

The Commissionâs consultation correctly identiï¬es that 70-90% of modern software relies on FOSS. However, the
current model for supporting this code is broken.

   â¢ The Case for Individual Funding: Most FOSS innovation begins with individuals. Yet, EU funding programs
     and foundations frequently require a "commercial entity" or "legal person" status to receive support. As an
     individual developer of UTMFW (the only remaining FOSS UTM ï¬rewall) and SSLproxy for over 20 years,
     my total sponsorship has amounted to roughly 46 Euros.
   â¢ Persistence Over Commercialization: My projects have comprehensive roadmaps and two decades of
     history. The lack of funding is not a result of "developer risk" or lack of clarity, but rather an institutional
     bias that ignores individual contributors in favor of organizations that are often more focused on overhead
     than code.
   â¢ Recommendation: The EU must create direct grant pathways for individual maintainers of critical
     infrastructure, bypassing the requirement for commercial intermediation.

2. The "Ecosystem Trap": How Proprietary Certiï¬cations Stiï¬e FOSS

Europeâs dependency on non-EU technology is not just a software problem; it is a human capital problem.

   â¢ Artiï¬cially Enforced Dependencies: Commercial juggernauts (Cisco, Fortinet, Checkpoint, Microsoft) have
     built ecosystems of training and certiï¬cations. Recruiters and HR departments prioritize these certiï¬cates,
     creating a cycle where European cybersecurity professionals are forced to become experts in proprietary,
     non-EU tools to remain employable.
   â¢ The FOSS Competitive Disadvantage: High-quality FOSS solutions like UTMFW are ignored not because of
     technical inferiority, but because there is no commercial incentive for a certiï¬cation ecosystem around
     them.
   â¢ Recommendation: The EU should sponsor and recognize FOSS-based certiï¬cation programs for critical
     infrastructure, incentivizing public and private sectors to hire based on knowledge of open, transparent
     protocols rather than proprietary vendor consoles.

3. The Startup Paradox: Venture Capital vs. Public Security

The Commission frequently conï¬ates "innovation" with "Startups." This is a dangerous oversight for
cybersecurity.

   â¢ Exit Motives vs. Longevity: Startups are designed for "exits"âacquisition or IPO. Their goal is to create IP
     (licensing and patents) that can be sold. FOSS is the exact opposite; its value lies in being open, shared, and
     enduring.

                                                        1 of 2
   â¢ Obsolescence by Design: Products developed by VCs are meant to last until a sale. Critical security
     infrastructure needs to last decades. Funding "startups" often means funding future closed-source
     acquisitions by non-EU entities.
   â¢ Recommendation: Redirect funding from "high-growth startups" to "long-term FOSS infrastructure
     maintenance."

4. Strategic Sovereignty: The Transparency Gap in Cybersecurity

The EU is currently focused on the hardware layer (e.g., Huawei bans) while ignoring the risks at the software
inspection layer.

   â¢ The "Western Closed-Source" Risk: Every major ï¬rewall and security middlebox used in the EU today is
     commercial and closed-source. These systems are capable ofâand often required to performâreal-time SSL/
     TLS inspection.
   â¢ The Decryption Paradox: We worry about low-level hardware but trust closed-source software with our
     decrypted traï¬c. Without FOSS solutions like SSLproxy and UTMFW, the EU has no way to verify what is
     happening to sensitive data once it is decrypted for inspection.
   â¢ FOSS has No Nationality: True security comes from the ability to inspect, adapt, and verify code. Relying on
     "allied" closed-source software is still a dependency that undermines European digital sovereignty.

5. Proposed Strategic Actions for the EU

To improve the state of "Real FOSS" and secure the European digital stack, the Commission should:

   1. Fund "Old Ideas" for New Sovereignty: Do not only chase "AI" or "Quantum." Fund the foundational
      technologies like UTM ï¬rewalls and Proxies that are currently dominated by proprietary monopolies.
   2. Support Individuals Directly: Establish a "European FOSS Maintainer Fellowship" that provides livable
      stipends to individual developers maintaining critical security projects, regardless of their commercial
      status.
   3. Mandate Transparency in Critical Tenders: Require that any security software used by EU public
      administrations for traï¬c inspection must be FOSS or at least provide a fully auditable, open-standard
      inspection layer.
   4. Dismantle Proprietary Lock-in: Use the Interoperable Europe Act to ensure that cybersecurity training in
      schools and universities is vendor-neutral and emphasizes FOSS tools.

Conclusion

If the EU continues to fund only commercial entities and "exit-driven" startups, it will remain a digital colony of
non-EU proprietary tech. Digital sovereignty starts at the source code. It is time to support the individuals who
keep that code open.
