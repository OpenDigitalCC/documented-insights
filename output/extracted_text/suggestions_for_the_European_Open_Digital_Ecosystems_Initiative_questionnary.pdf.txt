Strengths & weaknesses of the EU open-source sector?

Strengths

   â¢   Low total cost of ownership â Proxmox VE, Backup Server and Mail Gateway are 100 %
       open-source and have no hidden licensing fees, allowing organisations to replace expensive
       proprietary stacks with a single, integrated solution.
    â¢ No vendor lock-in â Customers can run the software on any hardware and can submit patches
      to add additional functionality that automatically benefits all others.
    â¢ High transparency â code can be inspected, audited and improved by anyone.
    â¢ Large, active developer community that drives rapid innovation and bug-fixes.

Added value of open source for public & private sectors?

Concrete EU-level measures & actions

   â¢   Dedicated maintenance grants for critical open-source infrastructure to ensure long-term
       security updates.
   â¢   Tax credits or subsidies for companies that contribute code or fund development of
       complementary modules.
   â¢   Standardised open-source procurement guidelines that recognize 100 % open-source solutions
       without hidden licensing fees.
   â¢   EU-wide certification programme for open-source security to build trust in sovereign-cloud
       stacks.
   â¢   Training & up-skilling programmes (EU-funded bootcamps) focused on important infrastructure
       software like Proxmox Virtual Environment.
   â¢   Prioritise open-source alternatives whenever they are available and demonstrably fundable
       for long-term use â this leverages the inherent cost-efficiency and vendor-independence of
       open-source solutions.
   â¢   Legislation and regulation must not discourage small or emerging open-source projects,
       overly restrictive rules push innovators toward non-EU investors, undermining the EUâs
       strategic goal of technological sovereignty. The EU should therefore create a regulatory
       environment that lowers entry barriers for nascent projects while still ensuring security and
       compliance.

What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

The EUâs most effective way to achieve digital sovereignty is to secure the underlying infrastructure
first, rather than concentrating only on end-user-oriented services.

Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) demonstrates how an open-source, software-defined stack can
replace proprietary hyperscalers while delivering all the capabilities needed for a sovereign
infrastructure.

If the EU were to fund and standardise similar open-source solutions across the infrastructure layer, it
could build a sovereign cloud that matches the functionality of the large hyperscalers without being
locked into vendors that have little incentive to support open-source alternatives.

Focusing on this foundational layer also reduces the âdevil-on-the-wallâ narrative that proprietary
players use to discourage open-source adoption. By promoting proven, open technologies like
Proxmox VE, the EU can:

   â¢   Retain control over data and services â No hidden licences or vendor-specific APIs.
   â¢   Lower total cost of ownership â The software is free, only support contracts are optional,
       which keeps budgets predictable.
   â¢   Accelerate innovation â The open code base allows rapid security patches and feature
       extensions, unlike the slower release cycles of many commercial stacks.

In short, securing the infrastructure with open-source platforms such as Proxmox VE is the pragmatic
foundation for an EU-wide sovereign infrastructure, while end-user initiatives can build on top of that
trusted base.

In what sectors could an increased use of open source lead to increased competitiveness and cyber
resilience?

Public administration
Low-cost, vendor-neutral virtualization and backup allow ministries to run mission-critical services
on-premise while keeping full control over data and security updates.

Healthcare
Secure, isolated virtual machines for electronic health records combined with encrypted backups
protect patient data and meet GDPR/medical-device regulations. This also eases collaboration
between medical communities which drives innovation and better healthcare for all EU citizens.

Manufacturing & Industry 4.0
Edge-compute nodes powered by Proxmox VE provide real-time control of production lines, the
integrated backup server guarantees rapid recovery from ransomware or hardware failure.

Telecommunications
Open-source virtualisation enables telcos to build private 5G or edge-cloud platforms without being
locked into proprietary hypervisors, improving service agility and reducing CAPEX. Securing the
telecommunication stack is also very important for any meaningful sovereignty ambitions.

Financial services
Keeping the infrastructure of our financial institutions save and secure should be top priority, again
having independent and auditable infrastructure in this sector is the basis for any meaningful cyber
resilience.

Defense & security
A sovereign, fully auditable stack removes dependence on foreign vendors, supports classified
workloads in isolated VMâs, and allows rapid patching of vulnerabilities, critical for national defence
cyber-resilience.

Energy & utilities
Distributed SCADA and monitoring systems can run on Proxmox VE clusters, benefitting from built-in
high-availability and disaster-recovery to keep critical infrastructure online during attacks or outages.
