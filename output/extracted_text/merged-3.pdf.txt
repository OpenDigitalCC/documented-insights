Personal background
In 1993, at age 14, I was the youngest person in my city to pass the amateur radio exam and begin
engaging with the earliest versions of Linux and other free, open source software at the same time as
engaging in the hobby of amateur radio. In 2002 I completed a Bachelor of Computer Science degree
at the University of Melbourne. During my career, I have worked in various companies in finance and
telecommunications and I have also worked as an independent consultant.

Carla and I married on 17 April 2011 and another Debian Developer died the same day. As he died in
Switzerland the official cause of death has never been disclosed. The death immediately before that
was a confirmed suicide of a volunteer who had sent everybody a resignation/suicide note the night
before the Debian Day anniversary. I published a full history of the Debian harassment culture for
people who want to fact check the social exploitation of open source communities.

25 April 2017 (ANZAC Day), the FSFE Fellowship elected me as their representative. I discovered the
FSFE is not authorised to use the name of the real FSF. As they are violating the real FSF trademark,
its been compared to identity theft or Nigerian fraud. I subsequently resigned from FSFE in total
disgust. Ever since, my family and I have been subject to stalking and harassment from political rivals
affiliated with the FSFE (fake FSF).

In April 2021, at the height of the pandemic, I founded the Software Freedom Institute. Rival
developers and organisations began an even more intense campaign of stalking. A UDRP legal panel
ruled that Red Hat, a subsidiary of IBM, had engaged in harassment and abuse of an administrative
procedure to try and discredit me and censor a blog post about children in the open source supply
chain. Link to Red Hat's evidence bundle containing the forbidden blog post.

On 6 May 2025 I launched a Pro Se legal action against the rogue corporations in the US District Court
for the Southern District of New York (1:25-CV-03883-UA). The case is currently at an early stage and
refers to criminal violations of antitrust regulations by the large corporations spreading libel about my
business and my family. A full copy of the claim is attached. This is the claim that is currently on the
public court records and the public are entitled to read it in full.

Based on the above, I have experienced free, open source software both from the perspective of an
unpaid hobbyist/volunteer, from the perspective of a paid employee/consultant and from the
perspective of a survivor and litigant.

Page (ii) of opening comments                           Founder, director of Software Freedom Institute

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open source sector?

strengths: we have some very talented developers who are EU citizens, EU resident and able to match
open source to the economic, social and cultural context of their country and the EU

weaknesses: foreign actors are imposing on cultural and legal protections, for example, by violating the
privacy expectations of EU-based developers. There is a perception that it is easier to get funding
abroad.

2. What are the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and maintenance of high-
quality and secure open source; and (ii) sustainable contributions to open source
communities?

Developers, especially women, fear public consequences and humiliations. These practices are long-
standing defects in the culture of all open source groups. Many consumers and business users believe
the software is free and don't want to give anything back to the community unless they have to.

People are often recruited on promises they are joining some kind of non-profit charitable group. Over
time they discover that some people are getting paid. Some people spend their own money to travel to
a community meeting and they discover other people had sponsored tickets. The people not getting
paid or the people who get an uneven share of the funds become disillusioned and quit. Some people
even died, like the Debian Developer who died on our wedding day.

3. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors? Please
provide concrete examples, including the factors (such as cost, risk, lock-in,
security, innovation, among others) that are most important to assess the added
value.

By definition, whenever you put a closed source product side by side with an open source product, the
open source product is always giving you one extra thing: the source code.

If you can choose to have the source code, why would you choose not to?

4. What concrete measures and actions may be taken at EU level to support the
development and growth of the EU open-source sector and contribute to the EUâs
technological sovereignty and cybersecurity agenda?

Provide stronger legal protections for individual developers and startup businesses who may be
attacked by larger rivals, online gossip and other forms of subversion. My company had purchased a

Swiss legal protection, Parreaux, ThiÃ©baud & Partners. They promised that no claim would be rejected
but in practice they rejected every dispute with various excuses. The legal insurance scheme was
secretly liquidated by the Swiss financial regulator, it is the JuristGate affair.

Provide specific criminal law mechanisms concerning groups who engage in coercive control tactics.
Extreme cases are already covered by laws about blackmail. Some jurisdictions have already
introduced laws about coercive control in domestic relationships. We need the same protection for
individuals who participate in group-based software development outside of their employer. Any time
the name of a software product or so-called "community" is used to denounce another victim, they are
engaging in a form of social engineering attack, they are engaging in coercive control. By creating
these mickey-mouse judgments about people, they are subverting the processes of real courts and
employment tribunals. At least once every year we see one of these groups make a public statement
denouncing some random victim. A number of people died in proximity to this culture and group
behaviour defect.

EU and national employment law needs to reflect hybrid ways of working and address the situations
where there is a clash between hobbyist and commercial open source. If people come under work-like
pressures, for example, when somebody goes to an event and they thought it was a weekend event but
they arrive and somebody insists there is a "Code of Conduct" now, they need to get time off in lieu to
comply with the working hours directive.

Due to the unique nature of developing and publishing software, need to contemplate opportunities for
people to explore open source outside of their normal workplace. Being more specific, in those
countries where citizens either do mandatory military service or citizens have a right to time off work
for military reserve, the equivalent time could be offered for open source software development
activities.

The French Validation des Acquis de l'ExpÃ©rience (VAE), which has prompted discussions about a
"VAE international" system, could offer a standardised and streamlined track for validating the skills of
those who have published open source software projects.

Publishers of open source and any other domestically created software, especially app developers, need
a way to bypass the gatekeepers. For example, the app stores on Android and iPhone are each
controlled by a single company, Google and Apple respectively. Without specifying how it can be
achieved, this elimination of gatekeepers is a very high priority.

Revise EU-level and national-level procurement policies to ensure that public institutions always use
open source software.

When engaging in outsourced service contracts, ensure the services use open standards and open
protocols to exchange data with public IT systems.

Apply a similar standard to hardware acquisitions, ensure that hardware does not prevent the owner
from changing the operating system or software.

Page (iv) of opening comments                            Founder, director of Software Freedom Institute

Put in place a process whereby all existing and ongoing IT expenditure is subject to continuous review
with two goals: publishing a list of future open source needs well before tendering processes occur, and
actively identify existing but incomplete open source opportunities well before the existing contract is
due for renewal. Open source communities rarely have off-the-shelf solutions ready to compete in a
tender process. If the needs are advertised well in advance, this gives solutions providers an
opportunity to plan ahead and be ready to bid.

For regulated technological products that are widely used, including mobile phones, cars and consumer
electronics, where we also have the motives to extend the useful lifespan and protect owners from
surveillance, enforce a right-to-repair. A full right-to-repair should give consumers the ability to
replace the software in the device, even if the original manufacturer has discontinued production or
gone out of business.

5. What technology areas should be prioritised and why? In what sectors could an
increased use of open source lead to increased competitiveness and cyber
resilience?

Elimination of gatekeepers, for example, the Google Android and Apple iPhone app stores can't
continue to be monopolies. Any organisation or sole trader who is lawfully registered in an EU state
should be able to publish an app and any consumer should be able to install it, even if neither the
publisher nor the consumer has a Google or Apple account.

Certain areas like telecommunications, finance and accounting are common to all businesses of all
sizes.

The education sector, at all levels, has been targeted by companies hoping to brainwash future
generations into using proprietary software. Some companies are offering their products or services
free of charge for academic use as this helps them maintain the domination of their products in
industry. Need to ensure that turn-key open source solutions exist for education. Need to ensure that
educational institutions are choosing the open source solutions.

Subverting EU law: the dark side of open source "communities" are the myriad
tactics used to subvert laws that distinguish the EU from the rest of the world

Various actors have seen free, open source software as an opportunity to subvert EU laws with respect
to employment rights, intellectual property rights, privacy rights, misleading trade practices, freedom of
expression, and gender equality, among others.

Employment rights: many free, open source activities have origins in hobbies and student projects.
Many conferences and events take place on evenings and weekends. This leads to many problems and
culture clashes. By default, this is non-working time for many participants. However, some
European Open Digital Ecosystems                                               Evidence of Daniel Pocock
Page (v) of opening comments                              Founder, director of Software Freedom Institute

participants do appear to be participating on a paid basis and they are granted time off work in lieu of
time spent at weekend events. On the other hand, some employers use the work produced by the open
source community but if their workers try to put these events on a timesheet, some line managers insist
it is only a hobby and not eligible for payment. There is significant inconsistency between different
teams and different companies.

Intellectual property rights: some groups attempt to subvert the notion of copyright, insisting that joint
authors can be "expelled" on a whim and their right to recognition extinguished on a summary basis.
Copyright law has no notion of expulsion: after a joint work has been published, all authors have an
ongoing right to recognition as developers.

Privacy rights: individuals and their employers face serious challenges with respect to privacy. Parallel
problems are emerging in every industry due to the rise of social media and services like LinkedIn. For
open source software, the challenges are even more extreme. We regularly see cases of poaching staff,
shaming people, blackmailing people with the threat of shaming and so on. The implication of these
practices is more serious for small companies.

Misleading trade practices, freedom of expression: free, open source software promoters have claimed
an affinity for freedom of expression. This philosophical promise has been used as a means of
recruiting people and it is used as a basis for claims the transparency makes higher quality software. In
practice, many free, open source software groups have engaged in some sort of "Code of Conduct"
gaslighting, where certain topics are forbidden and any reference to those topics is deleted immediately.
For example, the naming dispute between FSF and FSFE is a forbidden topic. The Debian suicide
cluster and written complaints the developers made before their deaths are a forbidden topic. If these
groups were sincere about freedom of expression, these topics would be valid for discussion.

Gender equality: for various reasons, such as the emphasis on using evenings and weekends and the
frequency of public shaming, it seems that very few women participate in free, open source software as
unpaid volunteers. Some companies have attempted to mask the absence of women by paying young
women to attend the events and dress in t-shirts like the volunteers. This causes embarrassment for
everybody. Young female employees believe they are attending a business conference on the orders of
their boss. These women are surprised to discover vast differences in behaviour between the
participants who are there to socialise in their free time. These misunderstandings and cultural
differences are exacerbated because some of the companies are advancing lofty statements about a
"Code of Conduct". In practice, if people are participating in a hobby during their free time, the
controlling corporations are misleading women about the nature of hobbyist and voluntary events.

I. BASIS FOR JURISDICTION

I. (A) Federal constitutional and statutory rights

   â¢   copyright, in particular, works created by a process of joint authorship (17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 "joint
       work")

   â¢   first amendment free speech rights (42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983) - action of a government employee

   â¢   first amendment free speech rights promoted, consented to by contract and acquired as
       consideration
       â¦ EFF claims to defend the US Bill of Rights while censoring discussion between developers
            on their Let's Encrypt Discourse forum
       â¦ Debian Social Contract, âwe will not hide problemsâ allusion to first amendment

   â¢   bad faith
       â¦ using words like diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), the promise that âeveryone is
          welcomeâ to promote a culture that reeks of intolerance

   â¢   antitrust behaviour, collusion and anti-competitive practices

   â¢   racketeering

   â¢   conspiracy

   â¢   modern slavery and human trafficking

   â¢   Chapter 12, 231(a)(1) teaching techniques for civil disorder

   â¢   Code of Conduct gobbledygook, akin to the Sovereign Citizen gobbledygook that US federal
       court has called out in recent cases

   â¢   âinterpreting the Code of Conductâ,
       â¦ a.k.a. practising law without a license, impersonating a federal judge, etc.

CASE REVISION HISTORY / CHANGELOG
   1. 6 May 2025 - original claim filed in NY on eve of conclave, premonitions about sovereign
      citizen and zizian phenomena
   2. 8 May 2025 - conclave elects Pope Leo, first ever US pope
   3. 20 August 2025 - dismissal, leave to re-plead. The judge kindly provided detailed reasoning.
   4. 26 August 2025 - two police killed, another injured while visiting a sovereign citizen in
      plaintiff's home state of Victoria, Australia (Dezi Freeman)
   5. 10 September 2025 - Charlie Kirk assassinated, public references to transgender woke/anti-
      woke conflict, as forecast in paragraph 496 of original complaint ("Zizian news reports...").
   6. 19 September 2025 - the claim is resubmitted. Chronological history expanded with additional
      points, references to original sources. Fundamentally, the plaintiff demonstrates four
      generations of his family have been in proximity to the real abuse scandal and the vendettas of
      the social media set have caused undue distress with references to "abuse" and "bad faith" after
      the conviction of a senior Cardinal. The plaintiff demonstrates that this is bigger than any
      single case of abuse, it is about parallels between cultures of abuse and "bad faith" in both the
      oldest and newest institutions. The judge noted that some points concern victims other than the
      plaintiff: this is deliberate, the plaintiff is not pleading on behalf of other victims but he wishes
      to demonstrate the dispute did not arise from some mistake or inadequacy on the part of the
      plaintiff, the dispute arises because of the overall culture and the habitual manner in which
      overlords are snubbing and censoring their co-authors. A new section has been added, "Legal
      Claims Based on the Facts Above", drawing together the key points from the history under each
      area of law. The plaintiff has added one additional defendant, Paul Tagliamonte, who sought
      reprisals against another American citizen, Dr Jacob Appelbaum, during the hours of Mr
      Tagliamonte's employment in the White House during the Obama administration. The plaintiff
      understands the first amendment doesn't apply to private parties by default but examines how
      tax-payer subsidised s501(c)(3) private parties have been formed both to promote first
      amendment principles and whereby first amendment freedoms, akin to academic liberty, are
      promoted as a form of consideration for otherwise unpaid acts of joint authorship. This promise
      of consideration may be viewed as a contract across jurisdictions and generations of developers
      and volunteers. Academic freedom in employment contracts would be disputed in state court
      but when multiple jurisdictions and copyright law arise, it feels appropriate to raise these
      contractual themes in federal court. The plaintiff has rewritten the section on reliefs requested,
      itemising reliefs on a per-defendant basis, as requested by the judge's order. The revised list of
      reliefs emphasises some of the defendants only have minor roles in sub-plots of the dispute.
      The plaintiff hopes some of the defendants, upon reviewing the reliefs requested, may identify
      expedient opportunities to avoid litigation. The plaintiff notes the court declined to consider
      state law claims and kindly requests an opportunity to re-plead these claims anyway after the
      court has reviewed the re-pleading of federal law claims. The assertion of joint authorship is a
      copyright dispute, copyright is federal law and in this case, instead of royalties, we are

      considering the fact that joint authorship gives rise to "legitimate interest" in the WIPO UDRP.
      The assertion of joint authorship, federal law, is therefore equally significant with the claims
      concerning the first amendment. This was a best attempt within the 30 day time limit to re-
      plead and the plaintiff kindly requests a further extension of 30 days to continue elaborating the
      points under copyright and antitrust.
   7. 24 September 2025 - the judge kindly provided leave to amend the pleading further.
   8. 23 October 2025 - the claim is resubmitted. Chronological history expanded, in particular,
      explaining the entire group admitted in 2006 that their behaviour, as a group, is the real problem
      and they need a psychiatrist to spend a day with them each year at the annual conference. This
      admission is notable because it immediately precedes the suicide cluster, with one of the key
      deaths on the plaintiff's wedding day. Email testimony from Vincent Danjean explaining how
      he was blackmailed to provide personal information when joining the group. Evidence the
      group discussed the use of a hammer as a metaphor for coercive control, not long after the knife
      and hammer attacks in France. Defendants: The service address of the US Attorney has been
      added for defendant Paul Tagliamonte of the Obama administration. One additional defendant
      Molly de Blanc has been added. Summary of claims against each defendant: this new section
      has been added before the full history of the dispute. It gives the name of each defendant and
      points to relevant evidence and dates in the history of the dispute. This was a best attempt
      within the 30 day time limit to re-plead and the plaintiff kindly requests a further extension of
      30 days to continue elaborating the points under copyright and antitrust, noting that there is a
      stay in place at the moment due to the US Government shut down.

SUMMARY OF CLAIMS AGAINST EACH DEFENDANT
Ariadne Conill
   â¢ persistently spreading rumours that a female intern in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) had a
       relationship with the plaintiff, vilifying both the female intern and the plaintiff (evidence:
       Techrights public chat log, 22 June 2021 and 25 July 2022)
   â¢ as an aggravating factor, these rumours were targeted at the period when the female intern got
       married in 2018 (not to the plaintiff though), so beyond being a simple libel, it is a defamation
       and a violation of family life and privacy

Gandi
   â¢ unauthorized credit card charges between January 2025 and June 2025
   â¢ breach of contract: transferred domain names from plaintiff to the defendant SPI despite being
      notified that legal proceedings had commenced in 2024

CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE FACTS

                                             Trigger warning

                               This complaint contains references to the
                                       Debian suicide cluster,
                                        and references to the
                        abuse in the Google open source software supply chain.

In short, just remember the Pro Se plaintiff in this case resigned from some voluntary tasks at a time of
grief. The plaintiff was an unpaid mentor for Google's Summer of Code and other people gained more
benefits from this relationship than the plaintiff himself. Google may be the world's largest company,
the plaintiff had just started a new business funded out of his own pocket, in the middle of a pandemic
too. The leadership figures, now defendants, used their positions to try and manipulate and denounce
the former mentor, somebody they had never remunerated anyway. When he was no longer willing or
available to work for free, they couldn't stand the thought of him getting paid for his work elsewhere.
They can't stand the thought of him getting his equal share of the recognition, nothing more, nothing
less, a simple thing that every joint author is entitled to. As a consequence of that selfishness, and only
as a consequence of that, all the skeletons have been let out of the closet, including a whole suicide
cluster, with one of the casualties in Switzerland deceased the very day the plaintiff got married. The
phenomena leaves psychological scars on survivor's lives, just as NXIVM left scars on their victims.

The defendants engage in various shaming and social engineering tactics that are a cybersecurity risk
for other volunteers, for the general public and for businesses who employ open source software
developers.

Pre-Debian

   1. 21 November 1916, Robert Edward Ernest Pocock (10768), 3 Divisional Train, 22 Company
      ASC deployed to France because of fascism in Europe. Recruited in Australia, he departed
      Southampton, UK on HMS Hunscraft. The arrival port and day is not clear but records for
      other units indicate the HMS Hunscraft had operated between Southampton and Le Havre. He
      is the great grandfather of Mr Daniel Pocock. Military records note he was a Baptist.

   2. 14 October 1922, Adolf Hitler and his cult take the train to Coburg, Germany to attack
      socialists. Nazis who participated in this early act of fascism got the Coburg Badge, âMIT
      HITLER IN COBURGâ, the oldest and most prestigious award in the Nazi cult.

   3. 1933, Mr Pocock's grandparents marry in the Catholic parish at Clifton Hill. The celebrant, Fr
      Frank Ryder, is the brother of Mr Pocock's grandmother.

   4. 9 November 1938, the Kristallnacht is the launchpad for the Holocaust.

   5. 1950, Alan Turing, the famed computer scientist who helped crack German cyphers and read
      the German leader's emails, publishes the paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence. The
      paper introduces the concept of the Imitation Game, which we refer to as the Turing Test today.
      The Turing Test is seen as a challenge to computer scientists to create software that can engage
      in conversation with a human being and fool the human being to believe they are conversing
      with another human. While doctors have the Hippocratic oath, that is, the oath that they will do
      âno harm or injusticeâ to their patients, computer scientists are challenged, by the Turing Test,
      to deceive people. From fake news to false rumours about sexual impropriety and false
      rumours about harassment, it has all become par for the course.

   6. 1955, Auxiliary Bishop Fox banned the Catholic Worker from the Cathedral, effectively
      banning in from every parish in the archdiocese. Bishop Fox's activism was fundamental to the
      creation of the Democratic Labor Party and kept Labor out of power for 17 years. The story of
      B. A. Santamaria, Archbishop Daniel Mannix, Bishop Fox and attempts to ban the Communist
      Party is analogous in some ways to the American phenomena of Joseph McCarthy.

   7. 1958, Auxiliary Bishop Fox was informed about abuse by Fr Kevin O'Donnell, investigated and
      did nothing, according to evidence submitted by ex-priest Mr Phil O'Donnell.

   8. 1960, Auxiliary Bishop Fox declared that no Catholic could in conscience vote for the Labor
      party. As he was an auxiliary bishop, this statement was not binding upon Catholics.

   9. 1960, Mr Pocock's grandparents acquire the license for the Westernport Hotel in San Remo,
      Victoria, the gateway to Philip Island.

   10. 1961/1962 - the first allegations against the late Cardinal George Pell, documented in the
       Southwell inquiry, confirm that a young Fr Pell was at Philip Island in both 1961 and 1962.

   11. 1964, Mr Pocock's grandparents are mentioned in a news article about the Liquor Royal
       Commission. Peter O'Callaghan is the lawyer representing the pubs and hotels. O'Callaghan
       would subsequently become the Church's independent commissioner for abuse. Many Catholic
       groups make visits to Philip Island and given that Mr Pocock's grandmother was the sister of Fr
       Ryder, it isn't hard to imagine some of them dropping in at the Westernport Hotel for one of the
       meals mentioned in the news report.

   12. 1967, according to a news report, Bishop Arthur Fox officiated at the marriage of Mr Pocock's
       aunt. Mr Pocock's grandmother is the sister of a Fr Frank Ryder, so Fr Ryder was the uncle of
       the bride. The groom's cousin, Fr Brian Cosgriff, is a well known priest who appeared regularly
       on television and radio. We could say Fr Cosgriff was one of the first influencers. Mr Pocock's
       father John Pocock was a groomsman. The ceremony received a papal blessing.

   13. 3 July 1972, Daniel Hourigan writes to Bishop Fox, who is now the Bishop for the diocese of
       Sale. Hourigan's letter admits he had physically punished boys and the boys had subsequently
       made accusations of homosexuality. Within days, Bishop Fox sent a reply recommending
       Hourigan apply for the seminary.

   14. 1973 Fr Ron Pickering is posted to St Peter's in Clayton. Corpus Christi seminary was located
       in the same district.

   15. Some of Mr Pocock's older cousins were in the parish and they attended primary school at that
       time.

   16. According to reports, Fr Pickering was very effective at procuring bequests from elderly
       parishioners who named him in their wills. In a later scandal, Mr Pocock exposes the FSFE
       (fake FSF in Germany) receiving a bequest that may have been intended for the real FSF, a
       s501(c)(3) charity in Boston.

   17. 1976, it is alleged in subsequent legal action Bishop Fox had ordained Fr Hourigan, despite
       Bishop Fox being aware since 1972 that Hourigan had admitted facing abuse accusations before
       entering the seminary.

   18. 1977, Mr Pocock's parents are married at St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne. The celebrant is
       Fr Bernard (Bernie) Joseph Mackin.

   19. 9 November 1978, Mr Pocock is born on the anniversary of the Kristallnacht. He was born in
       Coburg, Australia.

   20. 1979, Fr Barry Robinson went to Santiago, Chile.

   21. 1983, the parishes of St. John's , East Melbourne, St. Joseph 's, Collingwood and All Saints',
       Fitzroy were merged into a team ministry, with Fr Brian Cosgriff as Parish Priest while Fr
       Bernie Mackin and Fr. Barry Robinson served as administrators at various times.

   22. 1985, Fr Robinson returns from Chile to Melbourne.

   23. 1986, the US Congress enacted the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA),
       superseding provisions of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. The title of the act

                                            Page 36 of 391

       has confusing conflated fraud and abuse. The mean average time for an abuse victim to
       disclose their status is 30 years while most computers become obsolete far more quickly than
       that. The title of the act has fuelled conflict within the industry. At the slightest sign of dissent
       and in the pettiest disagreements between open source software volunteers, the name-calling
       quickly turns into highly libellous accusations and counter-accusations of abuse.

   24. Research suggests some thirty percent of women have been abused. Another researcher claims
       six percent of male religious leaders are engaging in abuse. For a lot of people, when they see
       the word abuse out of context, real abuse comes to mind. We see Germans in the FSFE (fake
       FSF) using the word abuse when somebody who is not German simply declines to follow their
       orders. Social media exacerbates the effect where people see the word "abuse" and they
       conflate the smallest sign of dissent or a political vendetta with the most serious transgression
       against an infant. Sadly, the name of the CFAA has become a catalyst for confusion and libel.

   25. 1987, Fr Daniel is assigned a role as an assistant priest under supervision and according to
       Broken Rites, working part time as a military chaplain for the Royal Australian Air Force
       (RAAF). This type of supervised role was typically assigned to priests who the church already
       had complaints about.

   26. 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall comes down on Mr Pocock's birthday. The Wikipedia page
       for Vladimir Putin, who was in Dresden at that time, describes the era: âPutin reportedly
       viewed the demonstrators' rage as excessive and confusing. He was skeptical of many of the
       slogans and claims shouted by the crowdâsuch as rumours of detention cells beneath the Elbe
       River where detainees were torturedâwhich he dismissed as complete fantasies. To Putin, the
       Stasi officers were colleagues, neighbors, and fellow bureaucratsâordinary paper-pushers not
       unlike himself. He found it difficult to reconcile the image of them as brutal oppressors with the
       individuals he had worked alongside during his time in Dresden.â In fact, with the European
       Arrest Warrant (EAW) system today, we see the same mentality whereby police and prosecutors
       from different European states are compelled to treat each other like neighbours and cousins,
       oppressing cult-leavers and political rivals. The cross-border relationships between police and
       prosecutors are sadly becoming a lot like the cosy relationship between Russian KGB and
       German Stasi. Look at the way the German prosecutors were able to exercise mind control over
       the French border police and prevent a British doctor who worked in Palestine from entering the
       Schengen zone to speak to a committee of the French parliament.

   27. Fr Daniel is moved to Healesville. Fr Daniel is the one to watch, he is in proximity to multiple
       scandals.

   28. Reports tell us that Fr Daniel arrived in Healesville with a porn collection.

   29. Reports go on to say that in Healesville, Fr Daniel began training (grooming) a group of 30 altar
       boys. Other reports have failed to notice a very odd coincidence: in his previous posting as a
       military chaplain, a platoon is the same size, 30 soldiers.

   30. Mr Pocock moved from Wandong to Bendigo and became an altar boy at St Joseph's church in
       Quarry Hill. The parish priest was Fr Timothy (Tim) Scott.

   31. Fr Scott was soon to retire and this meant Mr Pocock and his brother, as the altar boys, were
       trusted and given some autonomy in this minor leadership role at a very early age.

   32. No wrongdoing was observed by Mr Pocock at Quarry Hill.

Debian founding, obfuscation strategy at SPI, original agreements between joint
authors
   33. In 1983, Dr Richard Stallman (RMS), who is an atheist of Jewish ancestry, founded the GNU
       Project.

   34. In 1989, Dr Stallman created the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is an important
       agreement between developers as much as it is a license to end-users of the software.

   35. One of Mr Pocock's cousins dies.

   36. In 1991, Linus Torvalds began creating the Linux kernel. He chose to use the GNU GPL as a
       license and agreement between co-authors of the kernel.

   37. In 1992, Fr Barry Robinson was sent to Boston, the home of the FSF and Dr Richard Stallman.

   38. Another one of Mr Pocock's cousins dies.

   39. Richard Stallman of the FSF offers a financial incentive for somebody to create a Linux-based
       operating system where the principles of free speech and free software are inseparable parts of
       the philosophy, culture and legal framework for the project.

   40. Mr Pocock and some of the Debianists are related as joint authors of the Debian GNU/Linux
       software. The work was commenced in the United States by Ian Murdock in 1993. The work is
       created by combining the Linux kernel and other software into a complete operating system.
       Therefore, Debian GNU/Linux has many characteristics of a compilation of other works and it
       simultaneously has the characteristics of joint authorship. Both concepts are relevant. It is
       important not to confuse these two concepts of a compilation and a collaborative work or
       underestimate the extent to which each of these concepts is applicable.

   41. The term Debian Developer has been used since 1993 to refer to somebody who is a joint
       author under copyright law. Some of the oldest email archives from 1994 are using the term
       Debian Developer many years before the creation of an association or a trademark.

   42. In 1993, Mr Pocock, aged 14, was the youngest person in his city, Bendigo, to pass the amateur
       radio exam. He was trained and passed the exam at the Midland Amateur Radio Club (MARC)
       which used to meet in the Australian Defence Industry factory in Bendigo. The club
       subsequently became Bendigo Amateur Radio & Electronics Club (BAREC). He began doing
       voluntary work involving both amateur radio and open source software. These things have
       become a fundamental part of his life, both professionally and personally, since a very early
       age. He had less time for his duties as an altar boy.

   43. Mr Pocock, at age 14, may have also been the youngest participant in the Wireless Institute
       Civil Emergency Network (WICEN Vic). WICEN is one of many voluntary organisations in
       Australia, similar to voluntary firefighters and volunteer coast guard, who complement the
       ability of the state and the communities to respond to emergencies and disasters.

   44. All radio amateurs are subject to an exam and must demonstrate a minimum level of
       competence for emergency communications. WICEN members train and practice at a higher
       level than required by the regulations. At the time, WICEN members maintained their skills
       and served the community through events like the Southern 80 ski race, which has had a
       number of fatalities, the Great Victorian Bike Ride, the Mallee Rally, the Mt Tarrengower Hill
       Climb and most significantly the Massive Murray Paddle, which was then known as the Red
       Cross Murray River Canoe Marathon. WICEN voluntary activities were carried out alongside
       like-minded groups including the Land Rover Owner's Club (LROC) and the Royal Volunteer
       Coastal Patrol (RVCP). This experience is significant because one of the Debian deaths,
       Abraham Raji at DebConf23, involved disappearing and drowning on a canoe trip and Mr
       Pocock may be the only member of the Debian community with credible water safety
       experience. Debianists dismiss the experience of professionals like Mr Pocock as minutiae
       because pretending our work is just a game is inseparable from their mentality of not paying for
       anything.

   45. 1994, Mr Pocock was one of 60 high school students selected for the Spring Engineering
       School at the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) in Canberra.

   46. 1994, Fr Barry Robinson admits to real abuse. Fr Brian Cosgriff goes to Boston to exfiltrate Fr
       Barry Robinson. Fr Cosgriff stays in Boston for about a month and meets with the lawyers
       representing the Catholic church in the growing crisis.

   47. 18 May 1995, Fr Cosgriff writes to Archbishop Little advocating on behalf of Fr Robinson and
       explaining how Fr Robinson's transgression will not be discovered by the public. Fr Cosgriff
       writes that lawyers are "disappointed" about paedophiles being "warehoused".

   48. Why do the lawyers worry about convicted abusers from religious institutions being
       "warehoused" but they spread rumours about innocent volunteers doing "bad faith"?

   49. 1996, the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference issues a letter promising "serious offenders
       who have abused their power may not be given such power again".

   50. 2 September 1996, Fr Cosgriff writes to then-Archbishop George Pell, mentioning the work Fr
       Robinson has done in the parish of Williamstown, St Vincent's private hospital and the Alfred,
       one of Australia's world renowned public teaching hospitals.

   51. 16 February 1997, Bishop Fox dies in the same month that Mr Pocock joins the Australian
       Labor Party (ALP) Club at Melbourne University.

   52. 1996/1997 summer, having previously rowed at Bendigo and at Xavier, Mr Pocock joins Yarra
       Yarra Rowing Club (YYRC), where he eventually becomes bar manager and Vice President.

   53. Mr Pocock and other members of the community in Coburg join forces to create the Virtual
       Moreland Community Network. Carlo Carli, member for Coburg in the Parliament of Victoria,
       takes an active role in the committee.

   54. Around the same time, the Government has launched the Skills.net grant program and Virtual
       Moreland applies for a grant to facilitate training and web publishing.

   55. Virtual Moreland obtained premises on Sydney Road, Coburg, near Pentridge.

   56. Mr Pocock's father and Mr Pocock's uncle Walter were both employed at the Catholic
       Education Office (CEO) in the Archdiocese of Melbourne. Mr Pocock was able to recycle
       some of the old computers and servers from the CEO to make a community training lab.

   57. Craig Sanders, a Debian Developer working at the State Library of Victoria, assists Mr Pocock
       to migrate from Slackware Linux to Debian GNU/Linux.

   58. Mr Pocock provided his skills and intellectual property on an entirely voluntary basis at Virtual
       Moreland. He was not remunerated for these things.

   59. In plain English, the term Debian Developer also refers to somebody who has the skill of
       packaging software (creating packages) for other Debian users.

   60. On 5 July 1997, the joint authors ratified the Debian Social Contract. This is a contract between
       joint authors themselves and also between the authors and the wider world. Article (3) in the
       Debian Social Contract states âWe don't hide problemsâ. Most people feel this is aligned with
       the principles of the first amendment of the US constitution. The joint authors have created
       intellectual property without receiving any financial remuneration from royalties. Therefore,
       the free speech rights under the Debian Social Contract are very important because authors
       don't get anything else in return for their effort.

   61. On 25 November 1997, Debianists publish an announcement for recruiting people, âBECOME
       A DEBIAN DEVELOPERâ and they open with the promise âDo you want to see your software
       fly on the Space Shuttle?â. They are promising people recognition and prestige in lieu of
       monetary payment for the hours worked and intellectual property contributed. This promise of
       recognition is repeated even more explicitly in subsequent communications yet they eventually
       start breaking the promise and removing the names of some co-authors.

   62. On 28 November 1997, Global Web Builders (GWB), a far right group publishes a report
       doxing Kim Beazley, Carlo Carli and Mr Pocock, who was only 19 at the time. It may have
       been one of Australia's first doxing incidents. Mr Beazley subsequently became Australia's
       ambassador to the United States. Carlo Carli represented Coburg in the Parliament of Victoria.

   63. The doxing report attacks Virtual Moreland for helping migrants. In fact, Mr Pocock's mother
       is an Irish migrant, Coburg is named in honour of the first state visit of a foreign prince and
       Moreland was allegedly named after a plantation where slaves were trafficked.

   64. Mr Pocock's work on the Native Title web site was a runner up in the Triple J LOUD Festival.

   65. Fr Daniel was reported to police for the first time. The investigation into the allegations at
       Healesville was handled by Lilydale Crime Investigation Unit (CIU).

   66. 18 March 1998, Bruce Perens, former leader of Debian, wrote to debian-private about putting
       the Debian trademark in the public domain.

   67. Debian Project and SPI founders were aware of liability issues and planned from the outset to
       avoid responsibility. Ironically, in 1998 they were thinking about liability in the context of free
       speech, they hadn't anticipated the Debian suicide cluster:

There are precedents. Extrapolate from the obscentity issue we dealt
with a while back. This is a really nasty problem in that I would like
to stand up for these issues, but I don't really want Debian to volunteer
me to be the test case so that I can rot in jail while my child grows up.

I can see why you might have found that original statement offensive.
Let me rephrase it:

          SPI is willing to provide Debian developers with a liability
          shield and financial management. We are wary though, given the
          observed tendency of Debian developers to do anything they
          please. There has to be some sort of give-and-take in which we
          provide you with these services in exchange for your promising
          to behave responsibly about issues that could expose SPI to
          financial liability or SPI's officers to criminal prosecution.

As Tim mentioned, SPI officers can go to jail for stuff that you guys do.
As treasurer and president, he and I are the most likely ones to get
indicted. That is acceptable when we have some control over what is going
on, but it's clear we don't have any control. This doesn't really work for
us.

   68. 19 March 1998, Ean Schuessler wrote a long message to debian-private revealing that SPI and
       Debian are the same thing. There are many similar messages about the structure and the
       conspiracies.

   69. 27 October 1998, a newspaper in Melbourne, The Age, publish an article âStudents count the
       cost of Net reformsâ. The article features a photo of Mr Pocock along with two officers of the
       National Union of Students and includes quotes from three students at the University of
       Melbourne, Peter Eckersley, Michael Crozier and Mr Pocock. Remember, one of the themes in
       this case is that EFF has censored a message in their forum revealing that their former
       employee, Peter Eckersley and Mr Pocock were collaborators since they started their
       undergraduate studies in the 1990s.

   70. On 2 December 1998, a subset of the joint authors subscribed to the Debian Project
       constitution, forming an unincorporated association. The constitution was offered to 357 of the
       joint authors and only 86 of them chose to subscribe by way of a general resolution. The
       founder of the creative work, Ian Murdock, is one of those who did not subscribe the
       constitution. The term Debian Developer has a third meaning, in parallel with the previous two
       definitions, referring to somebody who is a member of the unincorporated association. But the
       original meaning, somebody who is a joint author, remains no less value.

   71. Authors of a joint work are equally entitled to recognition for their work. Using the term
       Debian Developer signifies that somebody is entitled to recognition. Disputing somebody's use
       of the term undermines their right to recognition.

   72. The Debian constitution, although only signed by 86 people, reminds us that the authors are
       unpaid volunteers. Therefore, the recognition is the only form of remuneration and it is vital to
       protect the integrity of that arrangement.

   73. Over the years, people have attempted to conflate the status of authorship with the status of
       membership. Rights of a joint author can't be extinguished by way of expulsion. If somebody
       never subscribed to the unincorporated association then it can not be said that they were ever a
       member. Consequently, the people who didn't subscribe or join could not be expelled either.
       Nonetheless, some among the Debianists kick up a stink from time to time, pretending they
       have power to extinguish rights of their co-authors.

   74. Any references to expulsions, as such, are used for the purpose of defamation and libel.

   75. The threat of such defamation is used to exact control over people, a form of blackmail that
       gives rise to white collar modern slavery. Coercive control.

   76. A whole new jargon has arisen for this purpose, a system of kangaroo courts under the guise of
       a âCode of Conductâ. It is Code of Conduct gaslighting, a narrative for coercive control.

   77. Debianists and similar groups use terms like âCode of Conductâ to borrow from the credibility
       of such phenomena in professional organisations. In practice, the processes, procedures and
       verdicts could be described as witchcraft and gobbledygook meets law of the jungle.

The Shaya Potter affair
   78. In 1998, before the constitution had been adopted, people decided to âexpelâ Shaya Potter. As
       there was no constitution at that point and nobody had subscribed to the unincorporated
       association, the only relationship between participants was a relationship of joint authorship.
       Potter was a child prodigy and US Navy intern who had drifted into the world of software
       piracy. Nonetheless, the affair was classified. In more recent times, we see certain people,
       including Mr Pocock, are subject to intense public harassment while other people, like Shaya
       Potter, were able to leave the Debian cult quietly and get on with their lives.

   79. Shortly after Shaya Potter fell out with the co-authors, he resurfaced at the Large Installation
       System Administration (LISA) Conference 2005 and won the Best Student Paper Award.
       Attendees at the conference, people concerned with protecting the integrity of computer
       networks, were blissfully unaware that they were applauding the first joint author supposedly
       âexpelledâ from Debian.

   80. Mr Pocock resigned from some of his voluntary mentoring activities at a time when he lost two
       family members. Why was somebody accused of software piracy able to continue his career
       but a volunteer resigning honourably at a time of grief is subject to intense, ongoing vilification
       by Debianists?

   81. Switzerland is known for privacy and secrecy. Debian is known for making strong claims about
       promoting freedom and transparency. Anybody who demonstrates that transparency claims are
       only adhered to selectively is revealing a significant lack of integrity by certain people among

       the Debianists. Rather than trying harder to fulfil their promises of freedom and transparency,
       Debianists nuke the messenger, by censuring his communications and deliberately sullying his
       reputation.

Student union representation
   82. 1999: Mr Pocock was elected to serve one term as Environment Officer in the Victorian state
       branch of the National Union of Students.

   83. During his time at university, including the year at NUS and the time when he was a member of
       a local ALP committee, Mr Pocock was in regular contact with a younger second cousin who
       had been at St Kevin's on a choir scholarship.

   84. A police officer from Lilydale joined the rowing club. By a bizarre coincidence, Lilydale police
       were investigating Fr Daniel at Healesville.

   85. 21 July 1999, Red Hat, Inc. was preparing for their IPO. They sent an email to thousands of
       volunteer developers containing a directed share offer, similar to the offers that companies make
       to their own employees. In the offer, Bob Young told volunteers "Red Hat couldn't have grown
       this far without the ongoing help and support of the open source community,"

   86. There is little data about how many people acquired the shares. Nonetheless, the net impact of
       the program was to align the interests of independent developers with the interests of the
       company. When these Red Hat shareholders participate in voluntary groups, they are not under
       any obligation to disclose their shareholdings. Therefore, when we are looking back at the
       archived email discussions, we can not determine which participants are really independent and
       which participants are Red Hat-aligned.

   87. Underage participants and genuine volunteers who never received the emails from Red Hat
       were to some extent naive and oblivious to the economic impact on their colleagues who did
       gain a shareholding.

Enron encouraged us to Ask Why?
   88. Enron, who had been recognised as the Most Innovative Company In America by Fortune
       Magazine, began an advertising campaign encouraging people to "Ask Why?". The videos are
       still available online.

   89. In many of the non-profit associations described here, anybody who notices the "diversity"
       money is given to the same people every year and dares to "ask why" is accused of abuse.

Edward John M. Brocklesby (hacking, SSH2 package maintainer)
   90. The next case of somebody being punished was Edward John M. Brocklesby (EJB) from
       Oxford. In this case, Brocklesby had used administrative privileges in ways that were not
       expected. Many system administrators and computer security consultants have come to expect
       Debian will be transparent about such risks but in the case of Brocklesby, much like Shaya
       Potter, the matter was dealt with very quietly.

   91. Of particular note, Brocklesby had taken over the Debian SSH2 package, which is critical to
       the security of remote access. This is the type of affair the community would have genuinely
       expected a public alert about. There was no public communication at all.

   92. Brocklesby was given a âtrial by IRC chatâ, which is ironic in the circumstances. Yet since the
       Code of Conduct gobbledygook arrived, there is no attempt at mediations or trials, there are
       only summary executions on social control media.

   93. Despite the secrecy around these security incidents, we see intense public defamation of people
       like Mr Pocock who asked ethical questions about where the money comes from and where it
       goes.

Resignation from student politics
   94. 10 November 1999, Melbourne newspaper The Age publishes a letter from Mr Pocock under
       the title âLeft Outâ. He reveals that people have resigned or being expelled from the most
       influential left group in student politics. Mr Pocock puts his position on the public record,

       distancing himself from corruption. In hindsight, the decision to write the letter and the editor's
       decision to publish it is brilliant: in 2003 the student union went into liquidation with $4 million
       in debt. People speculate it was the biggest ever liquidation of a student union. People ran the
       student union in the manner that you metaphorically run a student union. Mr Pocock had been
       first to call it for the lemon it was.

   95. 7 June 2000, Monsignor James Murray admitted abuse of a much younger woman while
       providing pastoral care to psychiatric patients in the 1970s. Monsignor Murray made the guilty
       plea asking the judge not to record a conviction as the conviction would make him ineligible to
       continue giving ministry. Recall the pastoral letter of 1996, "serious offenders who have abused
       their power may not be given such power again". The judge recorded the conviction anyway.
       Despite the 1996 commitment to sideline those who admitted or were convicted of abuse,
       Archbishop Pell allowed Murray to remain in a very significant position of leadership as Bishop
       of Geelong (Speak no Evil).

Joel âEspyâ Klecker: unpaid terminally ill teenager, fake news reports begin
   96. In July 2000, Joel âEspyâ Klecker passed away at age 21. He suffered from Duchenne
       muscular dystrophy. He spent his last years doing unpaid work on the Debian software.
       According to his blog, which is captured by the Wayback Machine, Klecker was motivated by
       the right to free speech, as in the first amendment and the EFF Blue Ribbon Campaign.

   97. Given that Klecker worked under those beliefs and received no other remuneration, given that
       Klecker's work can't be retrospectively untangled from the rest of Debian, it is not acceptable to
       retrospectively revoke the right to speak or any other rights that authors believed to be intrinsic
       to their collaborative agreement.

   98. Klecker appears to be the first death in the community.

   99. It appears that Klecker had anticipated his imminent death and revealed it using various
       communication channels.

   100.       Klecker resided and died in the State of Oregon.

   101.       Mr Pocock has not found any evidence in the email archives about support for people
      exposed to that death or exposed to details about any subsequent deaths. On the other hand,
      there is evidence that exposure to cyberbullying, exploitation and death can have some knock-
      on effect for third parties, right up to the phenomena of copy-cat suicides.

   102.       Public reports about the death of Klecker suggested nobody using his work was aware
      that he was dying. Messages from debian-private reveal that some people did know. Nobody
      offered him payment for his work. The Debian logo was placed on his tombstone.

   103.       Over an extended period of time since it was incorporated, SPI has accepted payments in
      relation to the Debian GNU/Linux software. SPI has never provided the joint authors with any
      detailed account of the payments received. SPI has regularly engaged in expenditures without
      the unanimous consent of all joint authors.

Chris Rutter, long working hours before stepping in front of a car
   104.       In early 2001, Chris Rutter was beginning his undergraduate studies at Cambridge, he
      had the obligations of a choir scholarship and he was doing unpaid voluntary work on Debian
      until the early hours of the morning. Emails were sent between 2am and 3am in the weeks
      before his death. He was out in the street late one evening and hit by a car. The police and
      coroner did not decide there was any fault on the part of the driver. In the absence of any other
      evidence, it is possible that fatigue was a factor in the death.

Mr Pocock's prior exposure to occupational health & safety challenges
   105.       Ironically, during his undergraduate studies, Mr Pocock ran an IT services company and
      his largest and most successful client was in the workplace rehabilitation sector. They strongly
      advocated early intervention and preventative efforts to reduce the risk of illness, injury and
      death. One of the directors, a life member of the industry association, was asked to give
      testimony to a parliamentary inquiry in 2002. Servers based on Debian software enabled the
      rapid growth of the business with budget predictability. The testimony made to the
      Employment and Workplace Relations committee are heavily weighted on prevention, casting a
      long shadow over the Debian graveyard:

               What is keeping people off work is, in many cases, the relationship between them and
               their workplaceâwhether it is their direct boss, their supervisor or issues that they are
               having at home that mean that they are not being a very good employee at that time.

Founding of Canonical (Ubuntu), some volunteers don't get paid, some do
   106.      In March 2004, Mark Shuttleworth forms Canonical Ltd and begins producing Ubuntu,
      an operating system derived from Debian.

   107.      Some of the Debian Developers receive payments from Mark Shuttleworth to advance
      the needs of Ubuntu. Some Debian Developers don't receive any payments or jobs though.

   108.     Sometimes the Ubuntu-funded contributions are beneficial to Debian as a whole but
      sometimes they create conflict because they have different priorities and deadlines.

Debian as a political party and influence over elections and democracy
   109.       14 March 2005, philipuso posts in the Debian User Forums a question about "Why not
      extend Free Software Movement into political party??". This vaguely reminds us of the
      mindset around the Catholic Church relationship and the Democratic Labor Party (DLP) in
      Australia. Discussions like this appear from time to time among people who live a significant
      part of their lives in the online context of the open source software ecosystem.

   110.       Related discussions have looked at the role of Debian Developers influencing elections
      or giving technical assistance to political parties, long before the major scandals of Cambridge
      Analytica came about.

   111.       It demonstrates the mindset of groups who want to go beyond exercising influence and,
      for better or worse, enforce their way of thinking on other people.

      rooftop at his workplace.

   114.      Late 2005, Fr Paul Pavlou, who had already been committed acts of abuse that were
      undetected, was assigned to be Parish Priest in Healesville, the same parish where Fr Daniel had
      been reported, investigated and convicted of real abuse.

Sweatshop unpaid work weekend in TU Darmstadt, Germany
   115.       In September 2005, a group of Debian Developers gathered for a weekend at TU
      Darmstadt. Photos from the event show them sleeping on the tables. The backstory is that they
      were encouraged to work for free, to give up the most basic comforts, because they believed in
      the principles and the Debian Social Contract. One of the participants is Frans Pop, who wrote
      many emails about his grievances and eventually committed suicide.

The promise of recognition, and nothing else, for lobar and intellectual property
   116.       3 September 2005, David Richard Bell creates a âWhyDebianâ page in the wiki where
      he explains: âThe motivations of the authors also are varied, but the coin that they get paid in is
      often recognition, acclaim in the peer group, or experience that can be traded in in the work
      place.â Similar promises of recognition are repeated elsewhere over the years. Yet this promise
      of recognition has been reneged upon in certain political dramas. Retrospectively replacing
      recognition with âStatement on [victim]â type messages is like bouncing a check. Yet if
      somebody complains the recognition check has bounced, the fraudsters become more hysterical.

US military: experts make tactical withdrawal from Debian mailing lists before
suicide cluster takes off
   117.       In April 2006 [redacted] the US Army 7th Signal Brigade asked to be removed from
      debian-private because there was too much noise. America is lucky to have smart people like
      that, they got out just weeks before the violence and the subsequent Debian suicide cluster.

      be trusted and people shouldn't keep the debian-private messages in a Google Gmail account.

Violent expulsion, DebConf fight, Ted Walther
   119.        In May 2006 the annual DebConf was in Mexico. Ted Walther is one of the joint
      authors and he had nominated in the election for Debian Project Leader. He used the election to
      raise concerns about the way the group was diverging from it claimed to be. Ted Walther was
      the first case of somebody being publicly and very visibly ostracised. He had committed no
      crimes, he was a target of political violence. News reports appeared about a âDebConf fightâ.
      His date at the DebConf dinner was a local dentist, yet the email records in the debian-private
      archive include suggestions that she was a prostitute. People knew they were bad to Walther
      and they used their control of the archives to write their own narrative and try to justify the
      unjustifiable.

Sven Luther resigns, others follow
   120.     24 August 2006, Joerg Jaspert writes on debian-private "Well, in short: I'm against
      Debian paying *anyone* (through SPI/ffis/whatever) for work, how defined or "important" that
      work may be. If that gets true it's time for me to resign."

   121.      In November 2006 Sven Luther told the community he was resigning around the time
      his mother died. It was reported as an expulsion and they tried to brainwash Sven to believe he
      had been expelled. This is what he actually wrote in his own words:

                      Subject: PLEASE HELP ...

                      This is, probably the last, of my desesperate calls for help.

                      I will probably be leaving debian fully, because frankly, it is not possible
                      for me to continue working on debian.

   122.      31 December 2006, Russell Coker wrote that the behaviour of Debian people is so tragic
      that we need a psychiatrist to come and spend a day with us each year at DebConf talking about
      our behaviour. Amaya Rodrigues Sastre replies suggesting the person needed to fix the group
      behaviour is actually a therapist, not a psychiatrist. Rodrigues Sastre asks "wether anyone
      knows a person" and by coincidence, a firm run by the most distinguished occupational
      therapists in Australia was a client of the Mr Pocock's first business, in fact, they were his
      biggest client. The request for a psychiatrist at this point in Debian's history is fascinating
      because this is where we all went down the path into the land of the suicide cluster. People
      could actually see that's where we were going and leadership figures did nothing to correct their
      behaviour problems.

                      Russell Coker: Debian has a huge pile of money that is apparently not being
                      spent, booking a good psychiatrist for a day for every DebConf would not make
                      much of an impact on Debian finances and might have a good impact on
                      productivity.

   123.       15 March 2007, MJ Ray writes to debian-private to suggest that threats of violence are
      tolerable because of precedent and habit (note to reader: threats of violence are a crime in many
      countries):

              The point is: threats of violence used to be fairly common, even on the mailing lists, let
              alone the more flammable IRC. Not everyone is going to change all behaviour
              overnight. Let's deal with it, but not lurch from total tolerance straight to total
              intolerance.

   124.       In March 2007 JÃ©rÃ´me Marant resigned on debian-private:

                      I must confess the load flamewars over the past months, along with the growing
                      practice of public humiliation, personal attacks and hate campaigns made my
                      last bits of motivation disappear entirely. Debian is no longer fun to me and Iâm
                      not interested in doing volunteer work in such a context one usually wouldnât be
                      able to avoid in real life.

   125.       In March 2007 Glenn McGrath resigned, debian-private:

                      Due to mostly social and some technical aspects of debian i have lost my
                      motivation to contribute directly to debian.

   126.       On 17 May 2007 Samuele Giovanni Tonon resigns with a message to debian-private:

              i'm retiring from the project, i don't want to be anymore part of debian, my packages
              have been all orphaned i hope someone will take care of them

   127.       In May 2007 Frans Pop resigned for the first time citing various grievances.

                      So, what has made me decide to leave the project. It's a combination of just plain
                      emotional stress over the whole Sven Luther issue, frustration with the inability
                      of the project to deal with that and with some other issues, and frustration with
                      the fact that a fair number of members of the project seem to feel that as long as
                      you don't upload packages with trojans, pretty much anything is OK.

   129.      The mother of a victim in Healesville had reported abuse to the church, she was

Uniforms: the Debian tartans (kilts) are created for DebConf7, Edinburgh
   131.      In the lead up to DebConf7 in Edinburgh, people decided to create a Debian tartan with
      a unique pattern (sett). The tartan was used to make kilts. Ever since then, Debianists are often
      seen wearing the kilts at conferences and events around the world. Wiki page about the tartan.

Uniform-wearing mentality doesn't confirm that it is a cult but it is a common feature in cults.

Future suicide victim comeback reveals beliefs of victims
   132.      On 19 October 2007, Frans Pop decided to come back from retirement. In the messages,
      he reveals how he was motivated/manipulated to work for free alongside the paid employees of
      various companies like Google and Canonical:

              To: debian-private@lists.debian.org

              Right. We are now almost 3 months after I made my resignation final (or
              5 months since I first announced it) and after a lot of soul searching
              the past couple of weeks and looking at what I've been doing over the
              past few months, I've come to the conclusion that I'm not ready to
              abandon the project after all.

              As my account is still active (which is probably not completely
              surprising), I guess that technically I'm still a DD and thus that this
              message should be sufficient. If not, please let me know.

              The main factors that have prompted this decision have been two real
              life meetings (Sledge's BBQ and a small dinner in AMS) and also
              watching the moving "last lecture" from MIT's Randy Pausch [1]. The
              first have made me realize the strong ties I've developed with some DDs
              and the last has made me reconsider whether I should give up so
              "easily".
              I also want to thank the many people who sent me a message (either on
              d-private or privately) in reply to my resignation mails. Though not an
              important factor, they have helped to make me reconsider.

              The fact that I want to be a DD again does not mean that I'm ready to
              go back to the level of involvement/activity I had before my
              resignation.

   133.       Anecdotal evidence suggests many of the unpaid volunteers are spending at least some
      of their time co-authoring Debian due to similar philosophical motivations. Sadly, they are
      building on unstable ground.

   134.      28 November 2007, Vincent Danjean (not from Interpol) writes about feeling pressure to
      provide personal, private information during the process of joining the group and now he is
      having fear and regret that the information could be shared, similar to the NXIVM victims who
      were forced to provide collateral when they joined.

   135.       17 April 2008, Sam Hocevar announces that the German Joerg Jaspert is simultaneously
      appointed both FTP-master and a member of the Debian Account Manager (DAM) team, two
      roles that have significant power.

   136.      18 April 2008, AJ Towns, the Australian who served as Debian Project Leader (April
      2006 - April 2007), makes a blog post where he indicates he is resigning from Debian
      completely with strong references to the concentration of power around the German dictator
      above.

   137.      This is significant because it precludes some of the key suicides and we subsequently
      see Joerg Jaspert taking a key role in the "demotions" modern slavery scandal. Remember, the
      Germans have always had this notion of a two-tier society, the Untermensch (Under Man) and
      so on. In Joint Authorship (Copyright Law), everybody is supposed to be equal but some
      Germans are more equal than others.

Fatal road accident (unconfirmed) after Christmas Day working, Thiemo Seufer
   138.        On 25 December 2008 Thiemo Seufer sent his last Debian email. He was working on
      Christmas Day. In Germany there are strict laws about working hours and it is unusual for
      somebody to work on a Sunday, let alone on Christmas. Seufer died later that night. This is
      another case where no official coroner's report is available. Social media users have referred to
      it as a car accident.

   139.       Germany doesn't provide a public coroner's report with the cause of death. No news
      reports have been found about the alleged car accident.

FSFE founder reveals tactics used to recruit unpaid workers and donors to FSF
copycat
   140.      On 10 March 2009 FSFE publishes âFellowship interview with Georg Greveâ, co-
      founder and then-president, where they discuss the FSFE Fellowship. Greve comments:

              The Fellowship is an activity of FSFE, and indeed one of the primary ways to get
              involved in the organisation. It is a place for community action, collaboration,
              communication, fun, and recruitment that also helps fund the other activities of FSFE,
              for example, the political work.

              We had been discussing starting this kind of activity since 2002/2003, but it took us a
              while to solve the issues that come with it. The balance we sought to find was one where
              membership was not related to payment, and influence was not for sale.

   141.       Greve's comments suggest that Fellows are members of the association. Recruiting
      campaigns and a button on the web site ask people to âJoinâ the FSFE. Yet from the creation of
      the Fellowship in 2005 up until it was abolished in May 2018, the Fellows were never invited to
      the annual general meeting, fellows could never nominate for president, etc. FSFE ran the
      Fellowship as a kind of parallel organisation where everybody was a second-class citizen
      compared to the real voting members of the FSFE e.V. Only approximately 20 people have
      ever been real voting members of FSFE e.V. and they are yes-men for the president. They gave
      people fellowship cards and FSFE email addresses to fool them into believing they were real
      members so the victims would do unpaid volunteer work for the president and his friends.

Punishments can be made arbitrarily for political reasons

      election to each name five people they would expel.

   143.       The Italian mafia have two ways of expelling people. Sometimes the victims disappear,
      buried in concrete, like the people censored from the Debian mailing lists. Sometimes the

       victims are beaten black and blue, their broken bodies dumped in a prominent location, akin to

Fooled about economics of open source, fake communities: Richard Rothwell
confirmed suicide in UK
   144.       17 July 2009 Richard Rothwell committed suicide, according to an official report from
      H.M. Coroner's Service. Rothwell had worked two decades as a school teacher. People in the
      âcommunityâ encouraged him to share the work he was doing for Linux in schools. Eventually,
      he felt he could quit his job and start a business working entirely with open source software.
      According to the report from H.M. Coroner and financial accounts filed on the public record,
      the business didn't cover its own administration costs. The parasitic âcommunityâ makes a lot
      of noise praising people who share their work for free but if somebody asks for money to cover
      their costs, if somebody tries to earn a living in open source, they are surprised at how quickly
      all the praise disappears and people undermine them or try to trick them to get more unpaid
      work out of them.

   145.      H.M. Coroner noted that Rothwell had been alone at the time of his suicide decision
      because his family was away for a few days. Through this complaint, we see examples of how
      the mafias deliberately isolate and exclude developers and then ration their social interactions to
      gain coercive control over them.

Word âslaveâ resonates with future suicide victim

Joerg Jaspert deliberately defames and banishes somebody by summary execution
   147.      3 March 2010, Joerg Jaspert starts a debian-private discussion with an email about
      "Software from hostile upstreams". Jaspert's email begins "this is on -private on purpose so that
      a.) someone can't claim I am doing slander and want to lower his reputation, and ....". He goes
      on "This also means that no new software from [victim] will ever enter the Debian archive.". In
      other words, he knows he is defaming somebody so it is more than libel, it is actually calumny.
      As Jaspert is in a leadership position, the culture of writing bad things about our collaborators is
      inspired and nourished by Jaspert's behaviour.

Fr Barry Robinson assigned to Easter mass at Healesville
   148.     After his previous parish had discovered Fr Robinson had confessed to abuse, he had
      been working as a supply priest when required to fill vacancies.

   149.       In 2010, Fr Robinson was asked to say the Easter Mass at Healesville, the same parish
      that had experienced Fr Daniel and Fr Pavlou.

   150.       The parishioners discovered in advance and planned a protest. The archdiocese
      cancelled the Easter ceremonies in Healesville. This time, instead of the police from Lilydale
      having to visit Healesville, the parishioners from Healesville were asked to attend Easter mass
      in Lilydale.

   151.      It is an odd coincidence, Mr Pocock rowed with the distinguished police commander
      from Lilydale. Peter O'Callaghan QC had assisted Mr Pocock's grandfather in the liquor royal
      commission. Mr Pocock's aunt was married to the cousin of Fr Cosgriff and Mr Pocock's
      second cousin had received the choir scholarship. Fr Cosgriff was connected to at least two and
      maybe all three priests sent to Healesville.

   152.     In both the case of Fr Daniel and in the Debian toxic culture, some of the later victims
      may have been spared if people had spoken up and acted on the behaviour problems even six
      months earlier.

Dissatisfaction with communications platforms, countdown to suicide
   153.       On 12 July 2010 Frans Pop expressed concern about the way censorship was creeping in
      as a flawed attempt to fix the chronic flaws in the culture of unpaid teleworking:

              So you'd prefer inter-developer issues to not be discussed at all?

              I find this an extremely inappropriate comment for a DPL.

   154.      On 9 August 2010 various people are forcibly subscribed to a âcut-teamâ mailing list for
      a work effort called âCUTâ. It appears that Frans Pop was subscribed to CUT. CUT eventually
      became the desktop used internally by Google staff in the Google offices around the world.

   155.       Friday, 13 August 2010, Lars Wirzenius, known to do contract work for Canonical Ltd /
      Ubuntu, announces he is there to âdriveâ a new system of form-filling called the DEP-5
      machine readable copyright file. The work is to be done manually by volunteers but the
      beneficiaries are the largest corporate users of Debian who want to do automated license audits
      across their IT infrastructure. Tasks like this spoil the fun in a voluntary activity. DEP-5 is

Suicide note sent as resignation email night before Debian Day project anniversary
   156.      There have been numerous conflicts over the years relating to the rights of the joint
      authors. On the night of 15 August 2010, Frans Pop resigned from the project for a second
      time. The resignation email was sent the night before the Debian Day software anniversary. It
      was subsequently revealed that this resignation was actually a suicide.

                      Date: Sun, 15 Aug 2010 21:41:18 +0200
                      From: Frans Pop <elendil@planet.nl>
                      To: debian-private@lists.debian.org

                      It's time to say goodbye. I don't want to say too much about it,
                      except that I've been planning this for a long time.

                      Participating in Debian has been great.

   157.       Frans' parents sent a message to Steve McIntyre, then leader of Debian:

                      "Yesterday morning our son Frans Pop has died. He took his own life, in a well-
                      considered, courageous, and considerate manner. During the last years his
                      main concern was his work for Debian. I would like to ask you to inform those
                      members of the Debian community who knew him well."

   158.      On 22 August 2010, Cord Beermann commented that Frans Pop had reviewed more than
      7,000 messages in the mail archive spam removal effort. Remember April 2006 when
      somebody from the US Army declared there was too much noise on the Debian mailing lists?

   159.       Two volunteers who discussed the death with peers on social control media were
      ostracised for one month by the Debianist Joerg Jaspert. This is scary because isolation at a
      time of grief can increase the risk of more suicides. But for a group with no ethical backstop
      like the Debianists, the risk of one more suicide may seem like a small price to pay to keep
      people silent about the suicide cluster as a whole.

   160.       Mark Shuttleworth wrote an email observing that there was an elevated risk of copy cat
      suicides in groups with a culture like this. He discouraged (debian-private) putting too much
      attention on Frans Pop.

              Regardless of religion, there is a proven danger in glorifying those
              who commit suicide, it encourages others to do the same:

                http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1732435/pdf/v057p00238.pdf
                http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19789643

              Debian's close-knit culture, and the extent to which many DD's feel a
              stronger affiliation to this group than any other, amplifies the danger
              substantially. The need for validation and recognition from this
              group,
              of this group, is stronger than any comparable organisation I can think
              of. Dedicating a release to someone is the highest honour Debian can
              offer, we should be extremely thoughtful about what incentives we are
              creating when we do so.

              As yourself this: if Frans had continued to give as generously of
              himself through the release as he did in the past, would you have
              wanted
              to celebrate that by dedicating the release to him? If not, what are
              you
              celebrating in dedicating the release to him now?

              We are all, rightly, shocked and saddened by the loss of a colleague.
              None of us should judge Frans' choices: there are many valid reasons to
              choose one's end. But we should be careful not to put others at risk.

              Biella may be in a good position to comment on the real human dynamics
              for those who are at risk.

Creation of âAnti-harassment teamâ to stifle alternative ideas and shield leader
form accountability
   164.       At the same time, the wiki page is created for the new Debianist âAnti-Harassment
      Teamâ. This is a decidedly negative name for a team that represents the us-vs-them mentality of
      cult-like groups.

   165.      By creating the âAnti-Harassment Teamâ, they are asserting that anybody who doesn't
      agree with the leader is guilty of harassment. In other words, any alternative viewpoints can be
      slapped down for any reason and the person expressing an alternative viewpoint can be
      smeared/libelled with the âharassmentâ narrative.

   166.       In groups that have this victimhood mindset, the leaders can operate with impunity.

Mystery death in Switzerland on Carla and Daniel's wedding day
   167.       Adrian Von Bidder, from Basel, Switzerland had become engaged as a joint author of the
      software during his studies at ETH Zurich. He was a former president of the VIS (computer
      science students, ETH Zurich) and board member of the Debian.ch âVereinâ incorporated under
      Swiss law. He died on 17 April 2011, Palm Sunday, the same day that Mr Pocock's wedding
      ceremony took place. The death was discussed in vague terms with references to how happy he
      had appeared to be. Remember, Joerg Jaspert was given his God-like powers on 17 April 2008,
      so the death of Adrian von Bidder-Senn comes exactly three years later on the same day.

   168.       Photos from the wedding show that Carla clearly had scars from self-harm on her arm
      prior to being married. The snobby people on social media who subsequently got carried away
      with rumours about âabuseâ, âharassmentâ and âbehaviorâ have grossly intruded on the privacy
      of Mr Pocock and his family over many years.

   169.       If Mr Pocock received $1 for every time some snob made a comment on social media
      then it would easily pay Carla's medical bills. But the opposite happens: the snobs who

              Dear Stefano
              Thank you for your wonderful mail! Yes Debian and people were very
              important to Adrian. I was glad that he was not only sitting alone in
              front of his computer but to know that there are people out there that
              estimate him and are his friends even if most of you did not know each
              other personally.
              The way you describe him (empathy, calm, insight, ... - just the Adrian
              I know) assures me on how good friends of Adrian are out there. And I
              will always continue to think of this (in a good way!) when continuing
              to use debian (which I became quite fond of because of Adrian).
              It's a pity that he couldn't go to Banja Luca anymore which he did so
              much look forward to. Anyway, I wish you all the best and hope you

              This is indeed very shoking news. I remember too well the great
              evening we had at my place just some weeks ago when we held the
              deian.ch annual meeting. With Adrian live and kicking as our

Maria Pauline Climent-Pommeret joins ENS Cachan and CRANS
   172.       September 2011, Maria Pauline Climent-Pommeret begins studying at ENS Cachan,
      Paris. In December 2011, Climent-Pommeret starts working/volunteering as a trainee in the
      CRANS Internet provider for the student residences. This is the earliest point that we can prove
      she came into contact with Nicolas Dandrimont and Pierre-Elliott BÃ©cue before she eventually
      asks for Outreachy funding in 2016. There are various hints that Climent-Pommeret is engaged
      in transgender / Zizian-style politics.

      Computing (HPC) and Margarita Manterola of Google are both pregnant with their first
      children. They want to change the location for DebConf13 which will occur around they time
      they give birth. The DebConf committee had already selected Le Camp in Vaumarcus,
      Switzerland the the women from EDF and Google want the whole conference to move to a
      venue that is more urban and family-oriented.

   175.       Out of 1,000 people, Debian has never reached the threshold of even two percent female
      participation. Of those women who do participate, many seem to be in relationships with male
      co-authors. Of those in Europe, at least three of these women were pregnant in the period
      2012/2013 and they applied some pressure to change the DebConf13 venue to be more mother-
      baby suitable.

      women was embarrassed about being part of a perceived Debian pregnancy cluster. Volunteers
      being kept in the dark were frustrated about the unexplained pressure to change the venue.

   177.       Women start contacting people privately to try and create a movement, like #MeToo,

   178.       Carla has significant medical costs due to her eating disorder. Companies like EDF and
      Google do not pay Mr Pocock and other Debian volunteers anything for their work or the time
      volunteers spend with maternity problems of corporate employees. It is an extraordinarily
      selfish system.

   179.      On 27 November 2012, Guerrero sends a message to Mr Pocock warning him that the
      native Swiss are plotting against him:

   180.       Ana Guerrero: âDon't worry too much and keep a low profile. We have almost gotten
      they postpone the contract signing tomorrow. that's a first step. I'm serious abotu the low
      profile thing, they like blaming things on you and if you're not active, they cann't.â

   181.       Guerrero's comments represent the general attitude foreign workers experience in
      Switzerland. Mr Pocock had moved to Zurich to work as a senior developer at UBS. Some of
      the other Debianists work in more junior support roles at the ETH Zurich university. In
      Australia we call it the tall poppy syndrome. Guerrero's email reveals the Swiss colleagues
      engage in a combination of racism, jealousy and scapegoating. They want to profit from Mr
      Pocock's skill and experience but they don't want to give him credit. They want to maintain the
      illusion that native Swiss people do the work without help.

   182.      The timing of this email, it was sent in 2012, is significant because it reveals the
      ingrained vendettas against Mr Pocock and his family have been there for a long time. The
      vendettas we see today did not come about because of something that happened in 2018 or
      2019.

âEveryone is welcomeâ in Diversity statement, but secret list of dissidents censored
   183.       20 May 2012 approximately 25% of joint authors voted to have a Debian diversity
      statement. The majority of authors didn't vote at all and so the diversity statement was imposed
      by default. The diversity statement begins âThe Debian Project welcomes and encourages
      participation by everyoneâ. Yet over the years, they keep finding excuses to ostracise some
      people. This is another case where there are questions about the integrity of the group.
      Obviously, after making the diversity statement âeveryoneâ is welcome, they can't simply
      exclude somebody for some minor reason. Therefore, if the cabals want to exclude somebody
      they have to make up some hysterical lies and deliberately libel the victim. This is why the
      subsequent conflicts involve such hysterical examples of libel.

Maintaining silence by force
   184.      Mr Phil O'Donnell, a former Catholic priest in Melbourne, makes a submission to the
      Victorian Parliament Betrayal of Trust inquiry. He notes that "Sadly, I am aware of people
      who lost their jobs in the Archdiocese of Melbourne because of their role in supporting
      victims. It is to these and other professionals, who worked so diligently in such difficult
      circumstances, that we owe a great debt of gratitude.". The same phenomena evolves in
      Debian, abuse victims ask Mr Pocock for support and the gangmasters seek to disparage Mr
      Pocock to prevent more people giving him evidence. Anybody who dares to mention the
      wrongdoing of the gangmasters is subject to rumours of "harassment" and "abuse".

   185.       25 September 2012, Mr Pocock is accepted into the Fellowship managed by the Free
      Software Foundation Europe e.V. FSFE asked Mr Pocock to make a payment of â¬60 per year to
      be part of the Fellowship. They gave Mr Pocock a Fellowship email address
      daniel.pocock@fsfe.org and a smart card.

   186.       Mr Pocock and many other volunteers believed that the process of clicking the "Join"
      button on the web site, filling in the form and becoming a Fellow had made them members of
      the association Free Software Foundation Europe e.V.

   187.       Yet unbeknownst to the victims, the FSFE was keeping the membership roll for the
      incorporated body separate from the membership roll for the Fellowship. The managers were
      treating the fellowship as if it was an independent, unincorporated association, similar to the
      structure of religions where the followers have no status in the legal entities.

Legal harassment and suicide of Aaron Swartz
   188.      11 January 2013, Aaron Swartz committed suicide after two years of legal disputes
      about access to academic journals and research papers.

   189.      Swartz had been a housemate of Dr Peter Eckersley a notable alumnus of the University
      of Melbourne and a contemporary of Mr Pocock.

   190.       Swartz was subsequently and posthumously inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.

   191.      The death of Aaron Swartz is well known in the open source environment, including
      groups like Debian and FSFE. Therefore, when we see these groups toying with lawyers to
      screw people over, it smells like they are tempting more suicides.

   192.       Ironically, US federal prosecutors pursued Swartz to the point of suicide on allegations
      that he failed to respect the intellectual property rights of the publisher JSTOR. Yet in Debian
      and WIPO today, we find the opposite, a total disrespect for the status of joint authorship. The
      Debian Account Managers (DAM) simply send emails to people with the subject line
      "Revoking your status" as an author. Failing to recognise the status of all authors equally is as
      unethical as plagiarism.

Slavery, two-tier system emerges, Daniel Baumann (Switzerland) secret demotion
as blackmail
   193.      In March 2013 the Debianist Account Managers (DAM) began the secret shaming of
      Daniel Baumann in Bern, Switzerland.

   194.      Under copyright law, all joint authors are equal, even if some contribute more or less
      than others. Nonetheless, the Debianists told Baumann that he was going to be their apprentice
      and they kept him in this state for a period of four years until they found somebody else to pick
      on, Dr Norbert Preining.

Pregnant developer ousts rival from Kde team then uses his name for baby
   195.      On 28 March 2013 they start the same routine with another co-author, JosÃ© Manuel
      Santamaria Lema, âSantaâ is libelled and banned from Debian. The message sent to over 1,000
      people on debian-private, behind Santa's back.

              Subject: Removing a non-DD member of the Qt/KDE team
              Date: Thu, 28 Mar 2013 10:00:57 +0100
              From: Ana Guerrero <ana@debian.org>
              To: debian-private@lists.debian.org, nm@debian.org, leader@debian.org

              [sorry for the duplicated email if you receive it twice]

              Hi,

              This email is about the decision of the Qt/KDE team [1] of banning
              JosÃ© Manuel Santamaria Lema, aka santa, from the team. This means removing
              him from the pkg-kde alioth group and removing him from all the group
              maintained packages.
              After that there are only 4 packages maintained only by him, that are KDE
              related and you can find plans at [2].
              JosÃ© is also a DM [3], at the moment, he's only allowed ....

   196.      The backstory is that everybody is working at different speeds and different deadlines
      and that leads to conflict situations. There was nothing fundamentally âbadâ about Santa. Ana
      was just about to give birth so she was under pressure and not in a suitable position to work at
      the same speed as Santa.

   197.       Ironically, Ana called her son Manuel, like the guy she just denounced.

   198.       The Santa incident demonstrates the tactics and the culture of using debian-private
      mailing list to distribute a long defamatory message about somebody to over 1,000 people from
      all corners of the open source ecosystem without the victim knowing anything about the libel.

   199.       Over the following six months or so, people would do things to provoke Santa. He
      didn't know about the discussions they were having behind his back. They tried to convince

       outside observers that something had randomly and spontaneously occurred. Winding people
       up to be humiliated and insulted is a common pattern for the snobby people in the cult world.

   200.     April 2013, following the social engineering attacks on Daniel Baumann and Santa,
      more people resign. Quoting John Hasler (debian-private):

              Iâve resigned. Your resignation procedure says I must announce that fact to this list. Iâve
              sent the requisite message to keyring@rt.debian.org and orphaned my packages. Please
              notify me if there is anything Iâve missed. Otherwise please do not respond.

Mr Pocock begins unpaid work for Google Summer of Code
   201.      In 2013 Mr Pocock began doing unpaid work for Google, Software in the Public Interest
      and Debian Project as a recruiter/mentor/manager for the programs Google Summer of Code
      and GNOME Outreach Program for Women (OPW). OPW has subsequently been renamed
      Outreachy.

      following proper procedures.

Archdiocese of Melbourne publishes list of known paedophiles

      internal Church procedures and other inquiries. Father Bernard (Bernie) Joseph Mackin is on
      the list.

   204.      The marriage certificate of Mr Pocock's parents, at St Patrick's Cathedral, was signed by
      an abuser and the Debianists, WIPO and the lawyers mock Mr Pocock and his family with
      rumours of "abuse" and "bad faith":

   205.      One of the witnesses to the marriage, Walter Francis Pocock is the brother of John
      Pocock. He was a teacher like his father Walter E. Pocock. Many of the teachers felt they had
      been taken for fools by the abuse scandal.

Libel motives and tactics documented by Russ Allbery, mystery death of Ray
Dassen during expulsion debate
   206.       On 11 May 2013, Thorsten Glaser sent a message on debian-devel about Canonical /
      Ubuntu conflicts of interest. Eugene V. Lyubimkin sent a message on debian-private, linked to
      the public discussion, with the title ânomination and call for supporters for expulsion of Josselin
      Mouetteâ. There were hundreds of message replies in different threads and sub-threads on
      different mailing lists. The environment was really negative that week.

   207.       14 May 2013, Russ Allbery writes a message revealing the motive for making up libel to
      ostracise somebody. Effectively, these elites like being in control of everything and everybody.
      They write programs to filter and sort their messages. But if Russ doesn't want to talk to some
      colleague, other people continue talking to the same colleague and the filter program he created
      is useless. Therefore, a little pack is formed and they work together to spread a rumour about
      the person.

              The last one is the one that people have, from the day the first Usenet newsreader
              introduced killfiles (which were a thing on Usenet going back far enough that they give
              procmail a run for its money), wanted to extend to all sorts of other noise problems,
              mostly as an excuse to avoid having to do anything at the server or source ends of the
              protocol. It's always failed. It only works if everyone else is ignoring the person too; in
              other words, they have to already be clearly and completely ostracized and viewed as
              noise unanimously.

   208.      Back in the days of Usenet software, these conspiracies would be contained to a single
      group of people. When people use the same tactics on social control media, the rumours spread
      without control and overflow into other parts of the victims' lives.

   209.      The tactics described by Russ Allbery are very anti-democratic. A small but very
      determined group spreading a rumour does not represent the majority.

   210.       The tactic described in Allbery's email doesn't work unless the libel is strong enough to
      upset third parties and even set off a conflict where the person targetted feels people acting
      strangely. The desire of people like Allbery to be in absolute control of conversations reveals
      the motive for protagonists to create nastier types of libel that involve references to abuse,

       behavior or hints about a secret complaint from a woman. Libel also works better if two or
       more people repeat the same lie. If they only used a very weak lie or if only one person spread
       the lie then the protagonist looks like a backstabber. Then it wouldn't justify ostracising their
       target. Allbery's email reveals he has a tactic for ostracising people that depends on both strong
       libel and a group effort, a.k.a. conspiracy, to spread the libel to anybody who sympathises with
       the victim. It is important to reflect on this concept because we see it being practised, in the
       sense of criminal conspiracy, against a range of victims.

   211.       Once we accept that certain people are operating with a motive to control discussions
      and the willingness to achieve that by telling strong lies, we can then see the possibility that all
      the negative stuff about certain people has been made up, no matter what titles they are using or
      how many Swiss lawyers they paid to lie with them, we can hold the liars / libellers / lawyers
      fully accountable for it.

   212.       18 May 2013 was the death of Ray Dassen. A message on debian-private suggested the
      usual catch-all âheart attackâ. There was no subsequent confirmation from a coroner. Ray was
      40 years old and had spent 19 years collaborating on joint authorship of Debian and GNOME
      software. The debian-private discussion was more muted than it had been for previous
      casualties.

Resignation from Australian Labor Party (ALP) leaked to Crikey

   213.      In July 2013, the Australian federal government made a video recording of female
      migrants without consent and published the video as part of the program of humiliating
      foreigners. At the time, Mr Pocock was living as a foreigner in Switzerland, another country
      known for harsh racism.

   214.      News reports had appeared simultaneously about victims of the government who had
      been raped and then, after being raped, these victims were forced back into the same
      accommodation with their rapists.

   215.      Mr Pocock sent an email comparing the abuse of migrants to the institutional abuse in
      the Catholic Church. These strong words were written a long time before the Spotlight

       documentary appeared in the cinema, therefore, it can not be speculated that Mr Pocock's
       concerns were motivated by the documentary.

   216.       The email was leaked to Crikey and they published it in full.

   217.      Asylum seekers, migrants and various abuse victims who have seen Mr Pocock's sincere
      and firm approach have reached out to him for support, including people in his own profession.

   218.      While various people from the ALP replied and some quietly expressed sympathy for Mr
      Pocock's principled stance in a very general sense, not one queried Mr Pocock's personal
      concern for these matters.

Faking non-profit creds, huge profit banked in Switzerland after volunteers travel
there to wash dishes
   219.       1 October 2013, Lucas Nussbaum sends an email to debian-private revealing that after
      leaning on volunteers to do all the chores like dishwashing at DebConf, they had $42,000 left
      over in the budget. There were no subsequent reports about who got the money.

Gobbledygook: Code of Conduct gaslighting, practising law without a license,
Linus Torvalds banned, purge gathers pace
   220.       In April 2014, through the process of a general resolution, approximately 24% of the
      joint authors consented to submit themselves to âCode of Conductâ gaslighting. The 76% of
      joint authors who did not consent have been persistently bullied to accept it anyway.

   221.       The Debian Project unincorporated association publishes a web site about âInterpreting
      the Debian Code of Conductâ where they describe how they are practising law without a
      license, making judgements about people. They describe a system with no natural justice or
      due process. Complaints are secret. Identities of complainants are secret. The kangaroo court
      was created under the name âAnti-Harassment Team (AH)â and anybody who disagreed with
      their punishments was accused of âharassmentâ. They renamed themselves to âCommunity
      Team (CT)â. They take the secret complaints into their den and make up a verdict and
      punishment without ever giving the accused an opportunity to respond. They refuse to disclose

       information about their conflicts of interest, such as their employment, shareholdings and
       romantic relationships within the body of joint authors.

   222.      August 2014, Linus Torvalds, Linux founder, banned from DebConf. Remember the
      lynching of Ted Walther at DebConf6 in Mexico?

   223.       August 2014, Wesley J. Landaker resigns from Debian, citing the toxic culture. It is
      notable because this was immediately after the bullies started using the Code of Conduct for
      urinating on the original philosophy (debian-private):

              Anyway, times, beliefs, and policies have changed, and the easiest path for me right now
              is just to retire rather than waste precious time fighting for special exemptions or being
              forcefully kicked out. I always thought Iâd be a Debian Developer until the day I died,
              but Iâd rather retire than be run out of town. ;)

   224.      4 September 2014, more people are noticing that the censorship stuff is going too far,
      Thorsten Glaser challenges the decision to censor Zenaan Harkness:

                      Don Armstrong dixit:
                      > Because of the following messages, I have blocked the posting ability of
                      > Zenaan Harkness <zen@freedbms.net> to debian-project.

                      I would very much like to know the reason. Posting links to the
                      messages alone is not enough, especially when said messages do
                      not appear to contain any inflammatory, ad-hominem attacking, or
                      otherwise material. Especially when said messages question the
                      censorship that is becoming apparent in Debian through both the
                      CoC and mailing list bans, recently (Norbert pointed this out
                      some time ago already, IIRC (if not, sorry about it)).

   225.      22 October 2014, another month, another Code of Conduct terrorist incident is declared
      when somebody uses the metaphor âtarred and featheredâ. Some people who not use the
      metaphor, but in an international community of authors working on a creative project, is it
      acceptable that somebody should lose their career for a wayward metaphor like that?

                      If I'm going to get quite this much mail about the COC and how evil it
                      is or is not, I might as well understand the facts of the situation and
                      I'd appreciate it if my fellow developers could help me out with this.

                      Is the text that brought the COC into this discussion the following?
                      >
                      >> And honestly, the person who thought it would be a good idea to call the

                      In particular:
                      1) Is that the issue that is aleged to have been a COC violation?
                      2) Is that single sentence the only complaint made? Were there any
                      formal actions taken--a mail to listmaster, a warning from someone in
                      authority to enforce the COC? Or was it just that single sentence was
                      written and then we discussed whether that sentence was appropriate?
                      I appreciate your help in addressing my confusion here.

   226.       November 2014: Remco van de Meent resigns (debian-private):

              I enjoyed it back then, but now I like to formally retire.

   227.       14 November 2014, Amaya admits that she is not competent to judge what other people
      are saying / writing and resigns from the Anti-Harassment team. Her resignation admits that the
      censorship and other nonsense is actually escalating conflict rather than reducing it:

                      Sorry, I seem to have lost the empathy and objectivity needed to hold this
                      position. I used to have it, but I no longer find it in me.

                      So before I manage to further allienate people and further escalate conflicts, I'd
                      like to be removed from the team (and mail alias).

   228.       November 2014: Richard Hartmann describes Debian culture (debian-private):

              words can hardly express how exhausted and chaffed I feel from the constant fighting
              and in-fighting. I feel confused and scared that what I always saw as the foundation of
              Debian, itâs social fabric, is not only tearing at the ends but that some rips are making it
              into the center, the very core.

   229.       November 2014: Arno TÃ¶ll calls out debian-private by posting to debian-private:

              by looking into my mailbox I seriously wonder what the point of debian-private is
              supposed to be. None of itâs (original) intentions seem to apply to whatâs currently
              discussed on this list. Therefore, I seriously wonder, what/how much benefit it gives us
              as I fail to see why we would need a dedicated place to discuss the evilness involving
              systemd, or insult and offend each other and then discuss how much insulting those
              statements were, or whatever else you feel, is currently needed to be discussed on a
              private mailing list.

   230.      1 December 2014, Holger Levsen writes a long email about âhow the CoC has been
      discussed and abusedâ and âhas made and makes me want to leave the projectâ.

              Indeed, it sickens me (a lot) to see myself having become negative, bitter, wrongly
              focussed and neither fun nor interesting. While complaining about "poisonous thoughts
              and behaviour" I've stopped contributing positivly myself.

Clytie Siddall death, Holger Levsen's musings about suicide
   231.      3 January 2015, Holger Levsen follows up again. Admits the whole Code of Conduct
      thing and Anti-Harassment team is nonsense. Hints of suicide and suicides past are not unheard
      of in Holger's emails:

                      since no action has been taken, nothing has happened, I hereby resign from

   232.       In January 2015 news appeared about the death of Clytie Siddall. Clytie had jointly
      participated in Debian and GNOME. Clytie had declared a pre-existing health condition,
      Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which raises the risk of suicide
      dramatically. Despite a number of deaths, the Debianists have never done any risk assessments
      for the impact of their behavior on people with these conditions.

   233.       21 January 2015, Torsten Landschoff writes about the phenomena:

                      [ObPrivate: I am not sure if the amount of retirements currently going on is

                      be the right forum.]

   234.       8 February 2015: Bartosz Fenski resigns because of Women-only MiniDebConf

              I wasnât too active recently but with the latest activity of our leader and oï¬icial support
              for women-mini-debconf I want to retire from the project. I donât want to be part of this
              anymore. Please hereby approve my retirenment statement. See you in project where

Fake scarcity: spouses selectively banned from DebConf
   235.      On 23 July 2015, the Google employee and Debian co-author Margarita Manterola sent
      an insulting email to Mr Pocock telling him that his spouse was banned from using his room or
      sharing the food at the DebConf in Africa. Manterola always gets a room with her partner.
      These tactics are part of a culture of pretend scarcity that is used to fool people into working for

       free. Manterola is one of the women who wanted to change the venue in 2013 due to the
       Debian pregnancy cluster but she vetoes any participation by other families. So selfish.

   236.       14 August 2015, David Moreno writes a resignation on debian-private:

                      Ten years ago today (2005-08-14) my account was created:
                      https://nm.debian.org/public/person/damog
                      Today, I don't feel like Debian represents me and neither do I represent the
                      project anymore.

   237.      15-17 September 2015, Joerg Jaspert attends GanetiCon 2015 in Prague. He gives a talk
      explaining that he indirectly works for Lufthansa. They use his company NSB
      Softwareentwicklung & Beratung GmbH as a middleman and he manages the unpaid Debian
      volunteers.

   238.       23 September 2015, Lucy Wayland has publicly disclosed mental health problems and
      suicide ideation but as with Clytie Siddall, the Debianists don't process that in any meaningful
      way.

                      This resonates so much â I have tried to explain it to people many times. I am in
                      my 40s, without children, but have lived with Bipolar II for over 30 years. âWhy
                      are you not dead yet?â. Because there are friends and family who would be hurt
                      by my dying. Sometimes I curse them, as I want to be let go.

   239.    November 2015, Joachim Breitner (nomeata) expresses concern about Daniel
      Baumann's welfare with comments on debian-private:

              There are a few people out there (and maybe in here as well) who see (parts of) this
              story and draw conclusions about how Debian treats contributors. Conclusions that I
              hope are in general false, and conclusions that Iâd not like to pervade our image.

Suicide of founder, Ian Murdock RIP
   241.       In December 2015, the Debian founder Ian Murdock committed suicide.

   242.      Murdock had publicised his intentions on social control media so the Debianists were
      unable to hide this particular case. San Francisco medical examiner published a report.

Mr Pocock questioned written obligations on Google Summer of Code working

   243.        On 26 April 2016 Mr Pocock sent a comment to the Google Summer of Code mentors
      list raising concerns the new rules, including an obligation to work 40 hours per week, would
      change the nature of the program from a performance-based project to a time-based
      employment. This, in turn, could have consequences under laws for employment and social
      security rights in some countries.

Open Source Conference Albania 2016, women outnumber men
   244.       14 and 15 May 2016, a weekend, is the Open Source Conference of Albania (OSCAL)
      in Tirana.

   245.      OSCAL was promoted on a web site of the European Commission and many of the open
      source software web sites.

   246.       Wikimedia Commons published four photo galleries after the conference.

   247.        In the team photo, we see six men, one fifteen your old boy and eighteen women in red
      t-shirts. This defies the normal gender ratio for the technology sector.

   248.      The salaries in Albania are very low. Young female students earn â¬10 per day to work as
      a waitress. There is a perception that diversity funds were used to pay women to appear at
      OSCAL or participate in photos with no follow-up about their status in education or
      employment.

Violence, vandalism & Debian libel at Dr Appelbaum's home in Berlin.
Presumption of innocence trashed
   249.      On 10 June 2016, somebody posts on Twitter about the vandalism ârapist lives hereâ on
      Dr Jacob Appelbaum's home in Berlin.

   250.      On 17 June 2016, Paul Tagliamonte, then employee of the US Digital Service in the
      White House, made defamatory comments vilifying the co-author Dr Appelbaum because, in
      Tagliamonte's words, âI am not comfortable with him aroundâ. Sly words like this repeated
      over and over on the debian-private whisper network fed a web of Chinese whispers, up to the
      point where people vandalised Dr Appelbaum's apartment block with the words ârapist lives
      hereâ.

   251.       18 June 2016, Jeremy âLunarâ Bobbio writes that every time a woman makes a
      complaint, groups like Debian should treat the suspect as guilty until proven innocent. This
      logic is then extrapolated to the point that the group should also be willing to repeat the
      accusation to others, using the name/trademark to lend credibility to the accusation so that
      accusers don't have the inconvenience of having to prove their gossip. Theodore Ts'o writes a
      reply to challenge the nonsense but many people are afraid to challenge the gossips because
      nobody wants to be the next target.

   252.       19 June 2016, Russell Coker doesn't want to publicly announce the punishment of Jacob
      Appelbaum because Coker lives in Australia and it is very easy to sue somebody for defamation
      there. Coker sends an email to Zini trying to encourage somebody else to make the libel public.
      Debianist Enrico Zini of the Debian Account Managers team writes an email admitting that he
      has the power to wreck people's career by publicly denouncing them:

                      So far we have never announced expulsions publicly. Personally, I've always
                      tried to keep in mind that an expulsion belongs to the here and now, and a public
                      announcement will potentially be googlable forever into the future, and although
                      I feel like I can make a choice about someone's membership at this point in their
                      and the project's life, I don't feel like I can make the choice of publishing
                      something that could, in some faraway future, be a mark of shame haunting a
                      healed person from their sick long gone past, showing up forever in recruiter
                      searches.

   253.        The above email is significant because it is a veiled threat to everybody else and because
      it hints at the level of thinking about these topics. They know they are able to hurt people and
      each time they let the dogs off the leash, it goes a little bit further.

   254.      21 June 2016, Australian journalist Sam Varghese publishes an article in ITWire,
      âAppelbaum banned from Debian events after sexual misconduct chargesâ. Sam Varghese is a
      collaborator of Russell Coker. We can see that Coker was trying to have somebody else make a
      statement so they could get the journalist to publish a story. Yet the headline is wrong: there
      were never any charges. Nobody even made a report to the police. This was a giant storm in a
      teacup based on social media gossips.

   255.       In this particular case, there was a lot of parallel gossip about a conspiracy. Russell
      Coker is known to work on NSA Security Enhanced Linux while Paul Tagliamonte was
      working in the White House and subsequently photographed in the Pentagon with the chairman
      of the joint chiefs.

   256.       The target of this gossip was an American citizen living abroad in Berlin.

   257.      Conspiracy or not, it demonstrates that Debian is easily manipulated by social
      engineering attacks, gossip and vendettas.

   258.       The way these people collaborated on debian-private to manipulate other people to say
      the libel in public is a prime example of the phenomena described in Russ Allbery's email from
      May 2013.

   259.       Up to now, people have been incredibly strict about hiding the messages on debian-
      private so it has not been possible for outsiders to see the role of Russell Coker orchestrating a
      quote from one person and then having a different person, the journalist Varghese, publish the
      quote.

   260.       Looking at the ITWire web site, we can see they have a tag they use for stories where
      Russell Coker collaborated with the journalist yet Coker didn't want to be quoted personally in
      relation to Appelbaum accusations.

                  https://mail.itwire.com/itwire-magazine/tag/Russell Coker.html

   261.      The ITWire news report was not the final goal, it was just another stepping stone. On 27
      July 2016, The Washington Post and the NY Times took the bait and published the story. Both
      of those newspapers based their reports on a quote about an âinternal probeâ. The âinternal
      probeâ may be a lot like the games on debian-private.

   262.      On 22 June 2016, Debianist Enrico Zini wrote an email to the editor of ITWire asking
      them to remove the quotes from other people. In other words, these close-minded people
      expect journalists, lawyers, judges and anybody else to publish only one side of the story, in
      other words, to act as their puppets.

                      Dear Editor in Chief of iTWire,
                      you may want to do something about this article by Sam Varghese on
                      Debian revoking membership of Jacop Appelbaum:
                      http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/open-source/73441-appelbaum-banned-
                      from-debian-events-after-sexual-misconduct-charges.html
                      While the first part is factually correct in its DPL quote, the article
                      ends with baseless hints of Debian and Tor having fallen victims to
                      manipulations by GCHQ psyops.
                      I consider that to be psycological violence[1] against the various well

                      known people who came out to report abuse, and I wish that news coverage
                      about this situation could rather contribute to creating a community
                      that encourages victims of abuse to speak up.

   263.      In the public Debian mailing lists, they block incoming messages from people who do
      not agree with the official group-think on certain topics like this. They fool the community with
      the impression that all the developers agree with certain topics and decisions.

   264.       On third-party sites like Reddit, they manipulate the administrators for individual topics
      to hide certain opinions. The tactics they use are similar to the message sent to the ITWire
      editor.

   265.       The public report from ITWire claims there are âvictimsâ in both Tor project and Debian
      project. But they are actually the same people. The same people are members of both
      organisations. The media was easily fooled by this word trick.

   266.       Remember when Joel âEspyâ Klecker died, many media reports and even a book repeat
      the story that nobody knew Klecker was bed-ridden and suffering from a terminal illness. But
      some people did know and they hid that information from the media. Therefore, in both the
      Klecker case (July 2000) and the Appelbaum case (June/July 2016), key Debian people are
      entirely comfortable deceiving the media and using the media to publish the narrative that is
      convenient for Debian's agenda.

   267.      By looking through this history today, we can see that Debian people have discovered
      the means to lie and they have motives to lie and when the stars are aligned, they lie and libel.

   268.      13 August 2016, Andreas Tille and Patrick MatthÃ¤i comment on debian-private that the
      presumption of innocence (everybody is innocent until proven guilty) is being trashed by these
      online mobs attacking Dr Jacob Appelbaum and they are concerned that Debian has fallen for it.

   269.      21 August 2016, long after the libel was published by the NY Times and Washington
      Post, Ximin Luo reveals he is not a real victim and he âheard it from a friendâ. This reduces the
      number of âfirst-person storiesâ that were mentioned in news reports.

Elias Diem, FSFE death not verified in Switzerland, membership scam discovered
   270.      August 2016, Elias Diem, an FSFE Fellow, died in Switzerland. They told us he died on
      a mountain. No official coroner's report was provided because the death happened in
      Switzerland.

   271.       2-4 September 2016, Mr Pocock attended the FSFE Summit in Berlin. FSFE is a group
      sponsored by Google. The FSFE Fellowship coordinator, Erik Albers, confessed to Mr Pocock
      that Fellows had not been properly recorded in the membership rolls of the incorporated
      association. Fellows were issued with Fellowship cards, email addresses, an annual election
      and a recurring membership invoice but Fellows were not being invited to the AGM. Mr
      Pocock, who had been a Fellow for a number of years, felt that he was deceived and decided to
      compete in the next election.

Interns, relationships, but not Mr Pocock
   272.      October 2016, Nicolas Dandrimont proposes his girlfriend Pauline Maria Climent-
      Pommeret for an Outreachy internship mentored by Mr Pocock. The girl subsequently
      withdrew her nomination. People have spread ârelationshipâ rumours about Mr Pocock himself
      but he had nothing to do with this arrangement.

                      From: Nicolas Dandrimont

                      As of today, the person I'm involved with, Pauline Pommeret, is applying to an
                      Outreachy internship in Debian (on the GPG cleanroom environment project â I
                      don't see her mail on the list archive yet, so something must have gone wrong,
                      but it should arrive soon enough).

   273.      Notice that the Dandrimont thing happened almost immediately after the Appelbaum
      scandal. Nobody published a news story about Dandrimont and his girlfriend. It feels like
      some people are protected.

   274.      Sylvestre Ledru, the other Debian administrator for Google Summer of Code,
      acknowledges Dandrimont's comments and suggest it is not necessary for Dandrimont to recuse
      himself and if the girlfriend wins the internship, it would be based on merit.

                  Ledru: I don't think you should. I think you proved that you care a lot about Debian
                  and its community and you will remain a good judge.

Fellowship elects Daniel Pocock
   275.       25 April 2017, the FSFE in Berlin announced that Mr Pocock, an Australian, had been
      elected by the Fellows. The Fellows are predominantly of German/Austrian/Swiss origin.
      People subsequently realised that 25 April is ANZAC day, Australia's national holiday for
      veterans who fought fascism. Mr Pocock's great grandfather was an ANZAC who served in
      France.

   276.       13 and 14 May 2017, the OSCAL conference in Tirana happens again. Mr Pocock
      attends the conference for the first time. He published a blog with a summary of his activities
      there, including a demonstration of amateur radio and Software Defined Radio (SDR).

   277.       Chris Lamb, the new leader of Debian, had also attended the conference in Albania. He
      sent a summary to the debian-project mailing list: "It was *extremely* remarkable and
      commendable that not only did the demographic skew of the organisers about 15-20 years
      younger than a typical conference, I would wager the gender split was around 70-80%
      female:male. The Albanian open source community is very healthy indeed."

   278.      A lot of the subsequent conflict in open source communities appear to revolve around
      Albanian issues.

   279.       June 2017, Mr Pocock publishes a blog post telling colleagues that the Albanian group
      plans to have a FOSSCamp on the island of Syros in Greece.

Harassment judgement in Switzerland, Carla, Daniel and black cats were victims
   280.      September 2017: Carla, Daniel and their black cats prevailed over a far right landlord in
      the Zurich black cat harassment judgement. Carla, Daniel and their two black cats were the
      victims (survivors) of the far right in Zurich.

FSFE impersonating FSF and â¬150,000 bequest questioned, Legal Network as
counter-community
   281.      During 2017, Mr Pocock, in his capacity as the elected representative of the fellowship,
      discovered that the FSFE was falsely claiming a relationship with the original FSF, a s501(c)(3)
      non-profit from Boston.

   282.       The FSF Executive Director John Sullivan confirmed the dispute in writing.

   283.      The FSFE (fake FSF) Executive Director, Jonas Oberg, admitted in writing that their
      original license to use a derivative of the FSF name had not been honoured by either side. One
      volunteer had left a bequest of EUR 150,000 to the confusingly similar FSFE. Mr Pocock,
      being the representative elected by the Fellowship, was concerned this money may have been
      intended for the real FSF in Boston.

   284.      The FSFE is operating a Legal Network mailing list where the discussions are hidden
      from the rest of the community. The existence of mailing lists like this goes against the
      principles of open source software. After the fellows elected Mr Pocock to represent them, Mr
      Pocock asked to be subscribed to the Legal Network mailing list. The president of the FSFE
      refused to provide the necessary access to the list, making it impossible for Mr Pocock to fully
      represent the interests of those who elected him.

   285.      The fellows and volunteers who contribute money and time are subsidising the work of
      highly paid corporate lawyers in the Legal Network (LN) and their annual Legal & Licensing
      Workshop (LLW).

   286.       A leaked email from Max Mehl reveals that LLW had a workshop about undermining a
      prominent open source license, the GNU GPL and its proponents, Linus Torvalds and Richard
      Stallman. This seems to prove that the secretive FSFE Legal Network is working against the
      very things that motivate the fellows to contribute their time and money to the FSFE (fake
      FSF).

Mr Pocock documents Albanian scandal, harassment victims ask for his support
   287.      During the middle of 2017 Mr Pocock started receiving reports from the Albanian
      female whistleblowers. He tried to escalate these concerns and provide support to victims but
      he received no support from Debian Project et al.

   288.      July 2017, Mr Pocock posts a message in the public discussion about the FOSSCamp in
      Greece. Many open source software events have free entry but this particular event has a ticket
      price. Mr Pocock innocently asks what is included in the price because he is trying to work out
      what additional costs people might face upon arrival:

                      @rskikuli Looking at the page with ticket sales, it is not clear what is included in
                      the price. Does the price include the accommodation or any meals? What other
                      essential costs will people have to pay?
                      For people who take the ferry from Athens, do you know the cost each way?
                      If people are going to ask for financial assistance from Debian or any other
                      project, they need to be able to submit a complete list of all their expenses before
                      purchasing any tickets.

   289.    July 2017, Redon Skikuli replies âIf Iâm correct, there is nothing included in the
      FOSSCamp ticket price ; no food, no accommodation, no drink, â¦â

   290.       The Albanian women had been sending requests to other organisations (Debian, Mozilla,
      Fedora, Wikipedia, etc.) asking for those organisations to sponsor their travel using funds from
      diversity budgets. These requests asked for both transport costs, accommodation costs and the
      ticket fees. But as Redon explained, the ticket fee did not pay for anything. Mr Pocock

       realised that this ticket fee, being siphoned out of the diversity budgets of US non-profits, was
       being collected by one of the Albanian men, Elio Qoshi.

   291.      9 August 2017, Redon Skikuli from the board of the Albanian hackerspace group Open
      Labs sends a message to Mr Pocock asking if he would like to become a member of the
      association.

   292.       21 August 2017, Faidon Liambotis (Debian co-author and Wikimedia employee in
      Greece) notices the same problems the Albanian female whistleblowers complained about. He
      writes to Mr Pocock and the Debian leader to alert us that one of the Albanian men is using the
      Debian logo to give credibility to a proposed âFOSScampâ event on the Greek island of Syros.

   293.       Mr Pocock had promoted the FOSSCamp on his blog in June so he becomes particularly
      concerned with checking the credibility of the event and deciding whether to withdraw the blog
      post or not.

FSFE considers loaning volunteers in exchange for secret payment
   294.       14 August 2017, Jonas Oberg (FSFE Executive Director) admits they have no conflict of
      interest policy for the voting members.

   295.      22 September 2017, Max Mehl (FSFE) starts a discussion about lending out volunteers
      from FSFE to do translation work for the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF). They have the
      discussion on one of the secret mailing lists and they talk about OKF giving the FSFE some
      money. It is not clear if they would tell the volunteers about the money or keep it hidden.

   296.      October 2017, Mr Pocock returns to the public discussion thread about the FOSSCamp
      and publishes his concerns about how the ticket fee was used. He asks the association's
      president, Kristi Progri, to publish a financial report.

   297.    The Albanian hackerspace had presented themselves as an association controlled by
      women with a 3/2 female majority on the board. Mr Pocock's email asks directly âAs

       chairwoman, could you also confirm all the money from registration fees was put through the
       Open Labs bank account or managed in a manner approved by the board?â

   298.      In the same message, Mr Pocock asks Redon Skikuli to elaborate on previous excuses
      about the registration fee: âyou wrote that a registration fee was needed because of people
      canceling at the last minute. I never received any reply to my earlier questions about how the
      fee would be used and this makes people more suspicious looking at this thread on the Open
      Labs forum. Why couldnât you simply ask people to pay some of the accommodation in
      advance if you were concerned about last minute cancelations?â

   299.       Mr Pocock notices that the web site of the FOSSCamp and the web site of the non-profit
      association have advertising for Ura Design, a private company run by one of the two men on
      the board. In the same email, Mr Pocock asks for clarification about the use of Ura Design
      publicity on the other web sites.

                      I wonât take that as an argument as at no point itâs mentioned WHO IS
                      CONCERNED with that apart @pocock.
                      The way @pocock has been handling this is very inappropriate towards us and
                      does not put me in a position to do something I am not required to do. Red Hat,
                      Collabora and various other open source business donât do public financial
                      reports either, because itâs a business, not a non profit NGO. The single source of
                      concern is Daniel at this point, I havenât seen anyone else expressing this
                      concern.

   301.      October 2017, Redon Skikuli sends a reply admitting that the private company, Ura
      Design was actually the organiser of the FOSSCamp. Therefore, the ticket fee paid the men for
      their work âhelpingâ the women presenting themselves as junior female developers.

   302.      October 2017, in reply to Mr Pocock's earlier query, the president of the Open Labs
      hackerspace, Kristi Progri answers to confirm that she can't produce a financial report because
      the money didn't go through the non-profit association and she says Elio Qoshi has to explain it

       brought an underage girlfriend to tech conferences.

Red tape & Debian: Arjen Kamphuis asked Mr Pocock for protection
   303.       4 October 2017, in a discussion about finding mentors for the Outreachy diversity
      program, Arjen Kamphuis replies to Mr Pocock: "We are a bit concerned about the strict and
      formal language here: https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/mentor-faq/ We'd like to agree Daniel
      will protect us from any Debian project bureaucracy so all time is spent on actually working
      the problem. I'm happy to arrange for a trip after November 17th to Amsterdam when Bill is
      back in town."

   304.       Arjen Kamphuis has joined a long list of people who asked Mr Pocock for support. In
      this case, Kamphuis asked for protection less than a year before he disappeared on a canoe trip.

   305.      Remember: Mr Pocock had been part of the WICEN amateur radio communications
      team for the Red Cross Murray River marathon. They never lost a canoe. Mr Pocock's
      grandfather left his job as a teacher because of red tape.

Protected whistleblower complaint from Mr Pocock to Mozilla Foundation about
underage victims
   306.      12 October 2017, behind the scenes, Mr Pocock contacted Larissa Shapiro and Emma
      Irwin at Mozilla Foundation, concerns about money from multinationals creating risks for
      underage volunteers in Albanian hackerspace. Mozilla Foundation was one of the sponsors.

   307.      23 October 2017, Arjen Kamphuis has been helping organise a trip for some of the
      Albanians to visit the Netherlands and the Hack42 hackerspace. He mentions that Redon
      Skikuli is the source of the problem and this is consistent with the message sent by Anisa Kuci.
      Mr Pocock was not part of the problem, he was a witness and provided support to victims.

              Been traveling like crazy (conference season) so did not have time to look into other
              issues. Also don't want to get caught up in internal politics but have noticed some
              strange events around the Dutch visit I've organised and co-funded for next month. Will

              have discusson about that with Openlabs and especially Redon who seems to put
              himself in positions of control in cases he should not.

   308.      8 December 2017, Eva Vranici sends a message to Mr Pocock on behalf of the board of
      the Albanian group âOpen Labsâ

                      We are pleased to inform you that, as of 2017-12-06, your Open Labs
                      Hackerspace membership has been officially approved. You are now
                      acknowledged as member of Open Labs according to its bylaws. Please find
                      attached and sign the NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) as a requirement to be
                      part of our online infrastructure.

                      We are proud to have you on board, and would like to thank you for all the work
                      you do for Open Labs! Keep up the good work!

   309.      Mr Pocock never signed any NDA with any of the associations related to open source
      software therefore he was never under any obligation of confidentiality.

CCC: Google-funded FSFE staff punish Google critic, Mr Pocock, as elected
representative, vilified for defending the victim
   310.      4 January 2018 â Erik Albers, FSFE employee, announced the censorship and isolation
      treatment for Michael Kappes (MajestyX), a volunteer who questioned Google funding at the
      CCC conference in Berlin, âRe: [GA] Konsequenzenâ

   311.       Mr Pocock, as the representative elected by the community, immediately rose to the
      defence of volunteer Kappes. The German FSFE staffers deeply resented somebody
      questioning the hierarchies they were imposing on people. Mr Pocock has a long history of
      sticking up for the little guy, including his defence of Michael Kappes, Dr Norbert Preining, Dr
      Jacob Appelbaum, Dr Richard Stallman and the Albanian female whistleblowers.

Mr Pocock signals lower availability for unpaid work in 2018 due to family issues
   312.       22 January 2018, Molly de Blanc is signing people up for Google Summer of Code
      again. Mr Pocock indicates that he can't be fully committed to the program in 2018. After all,
      he is not being paid by either Debian or Google.

   313.      Among other things, this was the time when Mr Pocock's father had been placed in an
      aged care facility and it was uncertain how long he would live.

FSFE âJoinâ button questioned by Mr Pocock as fellows never registered on real
membership roll
   314.        2 February 2018, Mr Pocock wrote an email to the public FSFE discussion list about the
      button on the web site that says âJoinâ and the page âJoin the FSFEâ being deceptive because
      the people who click the button and fill in the form are not being added to the real membership
      roll, they are used as donors but their membership rights are not respected at all. The FSFE
      management were furious that their membership fraud was called out publicly like this.

Keith Raniere arrested, NXIVM cult phenomena, cage, becomes public knowledge
   315.     14 February 2018, the FBI arrest warrant for Keith Raniere of NXIVM. The warranted
      was unsealed a few weeks later. The case had a global profile.

   316.      In the FBI's sealed complaint, Point (7), âNxians were often required to sign non-
      disclosure agreementsâ â just like the Albanian Open Labs girls. Look at the signature / footer
      of messages leaked from debian-private, âthis message shall never be disclosedâ

   317.      The FBI goes on, âa secret society was developed within Nxivmâ, a lot like the way
      every âtransparentâ open source software group seems to have a secret cabal controlling the
      bank account. Most Debian authors are never given membership rights in SPI. Most FSFE
      Fellows are never given real FSFE e.V. membership.

   318.       The FBI explains how the âDOSâ slaves had to give collateral. Looking at the case of
      Daniel Baumann in Switzerland (2014), the emails about his âdemotionâ made him a slave and
      the secrecy of these emails served an equivalent role to the collateral in NXIVM. FBI:
      âCollateral consisted of material or information that the prospective slave would not want
      revealed because it would be ruinous to the prospective slave herself and/or to someone close to
      herâ

   319.       âSome slaves were told that they had to collateralize all aspects of their lives, including
      signing over any assets, disclaiming their faith, and doing things that would ruin their careers
      and relationships if the collateral were releasedâ â look at how certain people in the conspiracy
      against Dr Jacob Appelbaum wanted to have the absolute power to destroy his career and terrify
      people away from speaking to him. We see the same phenomena in subsequent victims, Mr
      Pocock, Dr Preining (end of 2018) and the attacks on Sonny Piers in 2024. The overlords in
      both NXIVM and the Debianists want to have the absolute power to pick somebody out and
      destroy them at any moment.

   320.       âDOS slaves were required to perform âacts of careâ for their masters and to pay
      âtributeâ to their masters in various ways... akin to acting as personal assistants ... acts of care
      provided by a master's slaves, and those slaves' own slaves, should ultimately amount to the
      master having the work of at least one full time employeeâ. In open source, we see the big wigs
      in certain voluntary groups make promises to the Gods of Google and they rely on other
      volunteers doing the actual work. Look at how FSFE had an internal discussion about lending
      their volunteers to do translation work for other organisations. It is a slippery slope.

   321.       âDOS masters received a financial benefit in the form of continued status and
      participation in DOSâ.

   322.       Notice the word âstatusâ is used in the subject line of emails sent by the Debianists Joerg
      Jaspert, Enrico Zini, Jonathan Wiltshire. Recall the promise that recognition is the âcoinâ
      Debian developers are âpaidâ with. In fact, under copyright law, recognition is a right. Joint
      authors can give their rights away, they can sell their rights but the notion that the Debianists
      can arbitrarily extinguish somebody's rights and status is crossing a line. The âstatusâ messages
      to Baumann were sent with 1,000 other witnesses on debian-private, a giant humiliation.

   323.       âReadiness drills along with other aspects of the DOS program resulted in the slaves
      suffering from severe sleep deprivationâ â look at the road accident deaths of Chris Rutter (UK,
      2001), Manuel Estrada Sainz and Andres Garcia (Spain 2004), Thiemo Seufer (Christmas Day
      working, 2008). It can be difficult to know if fatigue was a factor after somebody has died in a
      road accident. In the case of Chris Rutter, the thoroughness of the UK authorities, it appears
      that many other factors were ruled out.

   324.       âBased on information obtained over the course of the investigation, DOS victims have
      explained that they believed they had to complete their assignments and comply with readiness
      drills and acts of self-denial or risk release of their collateralâ â fast forward to 19 March 2025,
      Luke Faraone sends an email âCommunity Team FAQâ, âThere may be some misconceptions as
      to what the CT means when it writes to someone... We don't want people to feel intimidated that
      any interaction they have with CT is just a stone's-throw away from an adverse decision by
      DAMâ. But people do feel the fear, otherwise they wouldn't periodically send messages like
      that. Many public messages appeared in December 2018 and January 2019 indicating that a
      culture of fear has been created, even if people deny it.

   325.        Page 11 of the FBI document introduces the NXIVM cage in their point 29. A few
      months later Molly de Blanc (Open Source Initiative President, GNOME Foundation Strategic
      Initiatives Manager) goes to FOSDEM conference and she shows a picture of a cat in a cage
      and she uses it to refer to Mr Pocock. The cage / dungeon stuff became a big feature of the
      news coverage.

   326.      Page 11, section F âBrandingâ discusses the NXIVM practice of branding victims' pubic
      regions. In Debian, the branding is psychological rather than physical, nonetheless, it is
      hideously intrusive. Dr Preining was told he was âexpelledâ for the second time on his
      birthday. Imagine having that thought on your mind on your birthday every year. The âabuseâ
      rumours about Mr Pocock were circulated on 24 December, Christmas 2018. Outside the
      Debian cult, Christmas is a festival day people associate with pleasure and family. The

       Debianists Enrico Zini, Joerg Jaspert and Jonathan Wiltshire are responsible for poisoning
       Christmas. The death of Adrian von Bidder was on the day Mr Pocock got married. Imagine
       having those questions on your mind on your wedding anniversary every year. Remember that
       Debian guy? Was it a suicide? Did somebody revoke his status before he died?

   327.       FBI, page 13, point 35 âSince defecting, several DOS victims have received âcease and
      desistâ letters from a Mexican attorney.â â the use of the WIPO UDRP to silence a critic
      appears to be completely analogous to Keith Raniere's use of the Mexican lawfare.

   328.       FBI: âAdditionally, the Heiress has made multiple attempts to have criminal charges
      brought against a former DOS slave, who has discussed her experience in the mediaâ â fast
      forward to 2021, the FSFE try to have volunteers arrested under German criminal speech laws
      for talking about the well known fact that the Nazis and FSFE both cancelled elections. Axel
      Beckert of ETH Zurich, a leading Swiss university, on the anniversary of September 11, tries to
      use the Swiss authorities to beat Mr Pocock into silence. The Swiss authorities themselves have
      a history of using sexual abuse to silence critics. Amnesty International published a report about
      the whistleblower Trevor Kitchen and others. Therefore, Debian, acting through Axel Beckert,
      by trying to use Swiss violence, they bring to mind the menace of sexual abuse by proxy.

   329.       FBI gained access to Raniere's email account. Page 14, (37), they examine the
      âcollateralâ from one of the first victims to join the âDOSâ subgroup of NXIVM. Attached to
      an email, the FBI find âa letter addressed to social services alleging abuse to CC-1's nephewsâ.
      The FBI suggest elsewhere that letters like this were created with false accusations. Remember
      the way people systematically created the false abuse accusations about Dr Jacob Appelbaum?
      FOSDEM has false abuse accusations against Mr Pocock in their mailing list, published by the
      Debianist Wouter Verhelst, on par with the content of Keith Raniere's Yahoo account.

   330.       FBI moves on to the forced labour, page 18, point 50, âJane Doe 1 was tasked by CC-1
      with reading and reviewing dense articlesâ â once again, compare to the confirmed Debian Day
      suicide victim Frans Pop, he reviewed 7,000 articles as part of a project to remove spam.

   331.      âJane Doe 1 was required to fill out a standardized form after reading each articleâ,
      compare to the FSFE âREUSEâ project and the Debian DEP-5 requirement that was imposed
      upon volunteers on Friday, 13 August 2010 by Lars Wirzenius and Ubuntu, that was the final
      piece of pressure before Frans Pop's resignation / suicide note.

   332.       âRANIERE also directly tasked Jane Doe 1 with an assignment to befriend and learn
      information about an ostracized member of the ESP/Nxivm communityâ â Mr Pocock has
      observed similar tactics around Debian and GNOME, for example, the meetings people had
      with Dr Norbert Preining and the efforts around Sonny Piers. Nobody is sure who they can
      trust any more and who is a friend and who is just a player.

   333.       Notice in NXIVM , the FBI document tells us the new recruits were not told that
      Raniere was the master. They were told it was a multi-level scheme for women. In the Debian
      constitution, we see that the Debianists Zini, Jaspert and Wiltshire have the roles of Debian
      Account Managers but looking at the private emails, we see that these roles are not really
      independent and they are manipulated or sometimes directed by the Debian Project Leader, a
      sole dictator. In the Albanian group, they pretend to be a group run by women but the non-
      profit group acts as a front for a private company, Ura Design, owned and directed by one of the
      men on the board. The president of the Albanian group, a woman, told Mr Pocock that the
      group's bank account was managed by an accountant associated with one of the men. The FBI
      had to go to some effort to show who was the real controller of the scheme so he could be held
      to account.

   334.       The difference between the two groups NXIVM & Debian is the manner in which
      collateral was collected, in other words, the manner in which some participants gained power
      over other participants.

   335.      In NXIVM, people invested time and money in the public side of the NXIVM program
      and they became emotionally invested. The victims were asked to make a step into the inner
      group, âDOSâ, after already making that investment of time and energy in NXIVM. They were
      asked to give collateral in a very direct and deliberate manner.

   336.       In Debian, people also make an investment of time and energy before the group gains
      power over them. Unlike NXIVM, the Debian victims are joint authors so they have an
      additional bond within the group, their moral rights under copyright law. The Debian
      ringleaders have tried to usurp copyright law with their notion of expulsions and making
      negative statements about people. Fundamentally, due to the nature of open source software,
      the victims can't sell their copyright interest and leave. The open source copyright interest
      comes with value for the co-author's reputation and earnings capacity but it is illiquid. In some
      ways, it is like having a university degree, it is of great benefit during your lifetime but you
      can't leave it to your children.

   337.      Open source software development, by its nature, is a highly public activity. For some
      victims, like Mr Pocock, they have done this activity since they were at high school. Everybody
      who ever worked with Mr Pocock throughout his career knows that he is an expert in Linux,
      Debian and related technologies.

   338.      Based on the above, if people realise in advance that they are not going to get on with
      the guy who has just been elected as leader, they can not simply sell their âshareâ in Debian and
      walk away. Once they get tied up in Debian, they are always at the mercy of the Debianists to
      some extent. The only mitigating tactic is to publicly and very loudly resign, but this involves
      waiving all rights to recognition.

   339.      NXIVM explicitly and regularly asked victims to simply give them collateral. In
      Debian, Debianists took the value of the public recognition and demonstrated that they could
      replace it with something very negative in the blink of an eye. They did that through the public
      humiliation of Dr Jacob Appelbaum (2016) and the privately organised shaming of Daniel
      Baumann (2014). When they chose to attack Mr Pocock and Dr Norbert Preining in 2018, they
      decided to do so secretly because on the one hand, they knew their control over these men was
      indefensible and on the other hand, they hoped the men would be held in a state of fear at the
      prospect that their humiliation by the overlords would be disclosed. These tactics and
      occasional references to their Debianists' powers created a state of fear between Debian
      overlords and all of their co-authors around the world, just as the collateral demanded by
      NXIVM created a state of fear between slave and master. While NXIVM & Debian both
      created the state of fear in different ways, they have both achieved a state of fear and obedience.

   340.       The NXIVM victims knew they were being asked for collateral. In Debian, the power
      relationship is created by more subtle means, Debianists seek to create a sense of honour, a
      sense of obligation to the group while simultaneously using games with words, like the
      âexpulsionsâ narrative, the references to authors as âProject Membersâ to obfuscate the fact that
      there is a strong moral right to recognition based on joint authorship. âProject Memberâ is a
      transient status as a âProjectâ, by definition, is also transient. An author has rights beyond their
      death whereas a membership right ends upon death. Looking at the emails from Frans Pop, the
      2010 suicide, we find evidence that he was under the influence of these narratives. When
      Manuel Estrada Sainz and Andres Garcia died in 2004, only the former had been formally
      registered as a âProject Memberâ and this resulted in some debate as to whether the latter could
      be referred to as a real âDebian Developerâ in the death notice. Yet if we accept the original
      definition of Debian Developer from 1993, it is clear both men were co-authors in the sense the
      term was used originally. The existence of these debates about who is a ârealâ Debian

       Developer proves the perception of authorship rights has been undermined and it also
       demonstrates that an honour-based system of obligation is present.

   341.       Debianists and SPI subsequently spend over $120,000 to have the preceding
      comparisons censored through the UDRP process offered by WIPO. The UDRP legal panel
      refuses to cite the actual comparisons or look at the merits of each comparison in their report
      and says that they can't be used at all because NXIVM involved sex and Debian doesn't. The
      UDRP logic distorts the fact both NXIVM and Debian simultaneously evolved to exploit shame
      and blackmail while the question of sex was only tangential. Did the Debianists spend that
      money because the NXIVM comparisons are far-fetched or did they spend that money on
      lawfare censorship because the NXIVM & Debian comparisons are too close to the truth about
      how this Debian group has evolved over the years?

FSFE president Matthias Kirschner meets FSF leadership at FOSDEM, admits
name confusion
   342.     12 February 2018, Matthias Kirschner sends a report about a recent meeting between the
      FSF and FSFE leaders at FOSDEM. Kirschner's email acknowledges that the name of the
      FSFE is confusing for people because people see it as an extension of the real FSF.

Mr Pocock selects outspoken female schoolteacher as intern, Lilie James death
predicted
   343.       February 2018, intern selected by Mr Pocock wrote a blog post critical of Google
      Location Tracking service, comments about the risk of being clubbed to death at the slightest
      resistance. The intern was threatened for speaking up. Lilie James was subsequently clubbed to
      death and Location Tracking was a factor. See the blog Renata D'Avila, âThe right to be
      included in the conversationâ

   344.       The Anti-Harassment team went nuts. Some time later, they sent a long rambling email
      to the female intern. They told her they were blocking her funding to attend DebConf18 in
      Taiwan. The interns were only paid for three month projects but the Debianists expected the
      remote interns in Brazil would want to spend time doing voluntary work to help bring
      DebConf19 to Brazil in 2019. Message sent to Renata, her prediction of Lilie James' death,
      although accurate, was not appreciated by some among the Debianists:

           Hello Renata

           ...

           Reinforcing positive attitudes and steps that you see in Debian towards
           women inclusion can also motivate yourself, the other Debian
           contributors, and possible newcomers, to go on working in that strategy
           and foster diversity in Debian. This does not mean to avoid criticism or
           hiding problems, but providing a more accurate vision of how the
           Brazilian Debian community works towards our common goals.

       Could this have been a shift from donations (decrease) to supporter
       contributions (increase)?

       Any comment on the change in Google donations: it is well below budget
       (36k < 60k) but for 2018 you forecast it will bounce back even higher to
       75k?

   347.       Google was contributing 20% of the budget. In other words, if management doesn't
      obey Google, those funds could be cut in the blink of an eye and the managers of the FSFE non-
      profit would have to take pay cuts or terminate at least one of their staff.

Mr Pocock's intern grievance: but against another man, never against Mr Pocock
   348.       26 February 2018, Renata D'Avila, the Outreachy intern in Brazil, writes an email
      indicating that she has a grievance with one of the other mentors, Paulo Henrique de Lima
      Santana (phls). The woman never made any complaint against Mr Pocock.

                      I'm sorry for the short notice, but I would like if any other Debian
                      Women would attend this meeting specially if Paulo finally shows up.

Mr Pocock wraps up Albanian investigation, female whistleblowers thanked Mr
Pocock
   349.      March 2018, Mr Pocock posted another message in the discussion about the
      FOSSCamp. Lior Kaplan had posted a message there trying to downplay the extent of the
      wrongdoing. Mr Pocock has seen the private messages with the funding requests and he quotes
      from one of them publicly:

                      @kaplanlior the fundamental point here is that when the funding request was
                      sent to Debian, it was sent from âWe at Open Labs Hackerspaceâ, not âWe at
                      Ura Designâ. Ura Design was never mentioned in the funding request sent to
                      Debian. Isnât that unfairly leveraging the good will that exists towards Open
                      Labs due to the hard work of so many volunteers over so many years?
                      In other communications I have subsequently seen, Ura Design was not referred
                      to as a for-profit entity but as a âdesign collectiveâ.
                      Further investigation revealed that the three people named in that funding
                      request were actually employees of Ura Design at the time they sent the funding
                      request. Each of them asked for the EUR 40 to be paid to their own employer.
                      The funding request did not declare their obvious conflict of interest.
                      According to Wikimedia guidelines 1, âWe support volunteer participation;
                      participation that is tied to paid work is not eligible for funding.â. If @elioqoshi

                      company wasnât supporting the event on a voluntary basis, isnât that a violation
                      of the guidelines?
                      They also state in the Wikimedia grant agreement 1 requires people to declare
                      any conflict of interest. Why did people submitting requests to Wikimedia not
                      declare their connection with Ura Design?
                      In this thread, people have made comparison to Red Hat, a for-profit company.
                      But I would ask you @elioqoshi and @rskikuli: do Red Hat write to non-profit
                      organizations like Debian, Wikimedia and Mozilla and ask us to pay for their
                      employees to attend their own summit? Or do companies like that typically waive
                      the attendance fees for their own staff or charge them internally?

   350.       5 March 2018, Anisa Kuci, one of the Albanian female whistleblowers, writes an email
      describing the real origins of harassment in Albania and thanks Mr Pocock for supporting the
      victims, the Albanian women who were exploited to pursue diversity grants on behalf of their
      male gangmasters. While supporting the Albanian victims, Mr Pocock indicated that he was
      particularly conscious of the risks to underage participants because his second cousin had been
      in the choir of Cardinal George Pell, the most high profile abuse case in Australia and the
      Vatican at that time. This is the email from Miss Kuci, she clearly identifies Elio Qoshi and
      Redon Skikuli as the source of harassment. Mr Pocock was diligently supporting the victims
      and received no thanks or support for his efforts.

           Thank you very much for being so supportive.

           I read the comments on the thread and to be honest I am really sad that Elio said that. It is
           not true at all.

           They (Elio & Redon) pretend to support women but on the other hand their behavior
           towards many of us shows the opposite.

           Daniel I feel bad because you have encouraged and helped not only me, but so many
           other people, no matter if they are Open Labs members or not, and also all the attendees
           from Kosova to learn new things, to work and improve their skills and knowledge. They
           are doubting your good intentions just to remove the attention from the shady things that
           they are doing.

           The free travel comment is really offensive to me and i feel it should be offensive to every
           woman who is part of the community.
           I have been contributing and supporting Open Labs since its early days, and I have put a lot
           of effort and time, I do this because I believe in what it is meant to stand for and without
           waiting something in exchange, but the situation lately has been not very positive. Daniel
           has been present by chance in few cases where situations have been very hard to go
           through.

           I would definitely like to talk to any of you and tell you more about everything that is
           happening here, its fine to me whether it is a video call, call or just emails.
           Please tell me what would be more convenient to you.

   351.      That email from Miss Kuci reveals the real reason some gatekeepers and their sponsors
      are going nuts about Mr Pocock. Mr Pocock has a long history of sticking up for the little guy,
      including his defence of Michael Kappes, Dr Norbert Preining, Dr Jacob Appelbaum, Dr
      Richard Stallman and the Albanian female whistleblowers.

   352.     March 2018, the founder with the underage girlfriend, Elio Qoshi, sends a reply to Mr
      Pocock in the discussion about the FOSSCamp:

                      this will definitely be the last reply from my side here. I have reached out to the

                      seems that you feel frustrated with the situation so let me tell you about my

   353.       Qoshi's angry reply reveals the real reason they asked Arjen Kamphuis and Mr Pocock
      to become members of the Open Labs association. Albanian gangmasters thought these men
      would sign the NDA and become bound by secrecy. Mr Pocock never signed the NDA and
      even if he did, it would not have prevented him from exposing the scam at work here.

   354.      It is important to remember that the women who spoke to Mr Pocock did so before he
      was ever asked to join the association. Therefore, they were potentially violating the NDA,
      they are technically whistleblowers. One of the Albanian female whistleblowers, Jona Azizaj,
      was a finalist in the Red Hat Women in Open Source awards.

   355.        In other organisations, the identities of people concerned would normally be protected.
      In open source organisations, publishing names is a common practice. The Open Labs
      organisation had published a manifesto with a strong commitment to transparency. Mr Pocock
      felt this was an environment with an American style of discourse, similar to the Debian Social
      Contract and the first amendment. Incidentally, the hackerspace is about one hundred meters
      from the US embassy in Tirana.

   356.        The ticket fees under discussion, between EUR 40 and EUR 60 per person, may seem
      trivial for some of the big organisations. The real issue for Mr Pocock was the coercive control
      of the women. Coercive control is typically presented as an element of domestic abuse and a
      number of jurisdictions have created offences specifically concerned with coercive control in
      the home. In this case, rather than finding coercive control in a domestic setting, it was found
      in a hackerspace, a hobbyist environment. Ironically, the Albanians and the organisations
      funding them took many photographs of smiling women, published the photos online and
      claimed this âcommunityâ was evidence their diversity expenditures were having a positive
      impact. The private emails from Anisa Kuci and Arjen Kamphuis and others reveal the truth.

   357.      Despite decades of voluntary work with free software projects, Mr Pocock never saw
      any group ask him to sign an NDA before encountering the Albanian Open Labs hackerspace.
      The NDA demands are a strong example of a coercive control problem. The young women
      never had any previous experience of a voluntary activity and they accepted that these NDAs
      were a normal thing.

   358.       Another major reason for concern with this situation is the relatively young Albanian
      group has been born bad because of the Code of Conduct rhetoric and other gobbledygook from
      larger role models like Debian, Mozilla and FSFE. Senior developers can remember what the
      world was like before all this nonsense came about. Many of the senior developers also have
      experience in unrelated voluntary groups so they know the open source Code of Conduct
      gobbledygook is an edge case and not the norm in professional life. The young people in
      Albania have grown up glued to mobile phones and social media, the open source communities
      are their first exposure to the outside world and they have no other point of reference.
      Therefore, when they see the Code of Conduct gobbledygook in their first encounter with the
      outside world, they are brainwashed by it and they can be exploited more easily. This situation
      is entirely the fault of the larger groups who fail to realise they have become such bad role
      models. Some of the developers in the larger groups are simply unaware of the extent to which
      other groups see them as role models.

FSFE censorship clause in new comms policy
   359.      Heiki LÃµhmus, President of the German FSFE (fake FSF) sends an email announcing a
      censorship regime:

              Subject: Policy for direct mailings to our Community

              Dear all,

              The Community Coordinator and the Council have come up with the attached
              policy for directly emailing (a subset of) our community. You will find
              that many of you can use this powerful tool under the new policy to help
              you campaign for software freedom. If you have any questions or concerns
              about your new rights and responsibilities, please contact me. The
              policy is in effect as of today's announcement.

              Yours truly,
              --

              # Internal Communication Policy

              This policy determines conditions and rights of the FSFE bodies (staffers,
              GA members, local and topical teams) or members of the FSFE community to to
              mass mail registered FSFE community members who have opted in to receive
              information about FSFE's activities.

              ## Definitions

              For the purpose of this document:
              * all registered FSFE community members who have opted in to receive
               information about FSFE's activities are referred to as "recipients".
              * mass emails that we send out to recipients are referred to as "mailings".
              * mailings that are only sent to recipients who live in a certain area (a
               municipality or a language zone or similar) or that are part of a topical
               team are referred to as "select mailings" and mails to all recipients of
               the FSFE are referred to as "overall mailings".

              ## Considerations

               * Mailings should be sent to better integrate our community in important
                aspects of our work, which can be for example - but is not limited to -
                information about critical happenings that we need their input or activity
                for, milestones we have achieved and thank you's, engagement in the inner FSFE
                processes and fundraising.
               * Mailings should be properly balanced between delivering information and
                getting to the point.
               * Mailings should contain material/information that can be considered worth
                of our supporters' interests.
               * Mailings are not to spread general news - that is what we have the
                newsletter and our news items for.
               * You can find help on editing mailings by reading through our
                press release guidelines: https://wiki.fsfe.org/Internal/PressReleaseGuide

               * All community members are invited to use select mailings for evaluations,
                to inform about certain aspects of FSFE's work, to organise events and
                activities or other extraordinary purposes.

              ## Policies

              * Mailings must not be against FSFE's interests and conform to our Code of
               Conduct.
              * All overall mailings have to involve the PR team behind pr@lists.fsfe.org
               for a final edit. In urgent cases, review by the PR team may be skipped
               with approval of the responsible authority.
              * All select mailings need approval by the relevant country or topical team
               coordinator or - in absence - by the Community Coordinator or the Executive
               Council.
              * All overall mailings need the approval of the Executive Council.
              * All mailings need to be reviewed by someone with the authority to approve
               the mailing. Nobody may review or approve a mailing they have prepared on
               their own.
   360.       As an âinternalâ policy, it was discussed on an internal mailing list and it was not meant
      to be shown to the Fellows.

   361.       Remember, on ANZAC day, the Fellows had elected me as their representative, to give
      them reports about how effectively management runs the organisation. I felt the expectation
      âmailings must not be against FSFE's interestsâ prevented me from giving honest reports or any
      reports about incompetence and corruption.

   362.    They were expecting me to work like an unpaid public relations intern making shallow
      comments on social media rather than a real representative.

   363.       Fellows had been promised a real representative, so I feel that secretly applying a policy
      like this to the representative was even stronger evidence that the organisation is corrupt.

   364.      Fellows, donors and other organisations are told that the FSFE promotes freedom and
      transparency but the policy contradicts that, therefore, the imposition of such a censorship

       regime, censoring the elected representative is more severe in this case than it would be in some
       other organisation that wasn't claiming to be a champion of freedom and transparency.

   365.       Given that it is a distributed, online community, the impact of the policy is much more
      severe than it would be in a real-world community. In a real-world organisation, people have
      meetings from time to time where they can share information about the management and hold
      people to account. In a purely online group, like this Google-backed fake FSF, the president
      can sculpt an image of himself completely at odds with reality.

   366.       In a cult, you can only say nice things about the cult.

Albania: OSCAL conference 2018
   367.      19 and 20 May 2018, Mr Pocock attends the annual OSCAL conference in Tirana,
      Albania.

   368.      The conference dinner, on Saturday night, is in a restaurant operated by the parents of
      Anisa Kuci, one of the Albanian female whistleblowers.

   369.       Mr Pocock is seated at a table with Arjen Kamphuis.

Germans cancelled elections again, proves Google afraid of Mr Pocock's questions
   370.       26 May 2018, the FSFE (fake FSF) had an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM)
      where they resolved to remove the Fellowship elections from their constitution. The last person
      the community elected was Mr Pocock. The fake FSF doesn't play fair. The EGM was held in
      Berlin, Germany. The same person, a German, Matthias Kirschner, has remained
      president/dictator ever since then. Mr Pocock's birthday is 9 November, the Kristallnacht, so
      the experience of Google-funded Germans cancelling elections inevitably reminds him of the
      Holocaust. That smells like a case of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED).

   371.      28 May 2018, Armijn Hemel (Tjaldur Software Governance Solutions) writes a lengthy
      email resignation from the FSFE's Legal Team. The email is lengthy but it is quoted here in full

       to emphasise the fact Mr Pocock was not responsible for the problems in FSFE, the whole
       FSFE is a scam pretending to be associated with FSF so people will give them money and do
       work for free.

                      I have decided to leave FSFE's legal team after almost 12 years. This
                      was not an easy decision to make and it has actually been on my mind for
                      many many months.

                      My frustration with FSFE has been growing for the last number of years.
                      When the new leadership team came on board it was to be expected that
                      some things would change but unfortunately it was not the change I had
                      hoped for. While there are many things that have contributed to my
                      decision there are a few core issues that are central. I am going to
                      explain these and hope that FSFE's leadership will (finally) listen and
                      take action.

                      * Decreased engagement of the legal team

                      Where before the legal team would be consulted for its opinion prior to
                      decisions regarding the legal strategy of FSFE or other issues affecting
                      the legal team it now seems that the legal team is merely informed of
                      the decisions made by FSFE's management. This has had profound effects
                      on the motivation of the legal team. While before there used to be a
                      flurry of activity this is no longer the case, and there are very few
                      conversations about real legal issues or discussions about legal
                      questions, and so on.

                      * Decreased visibility in the outside world regarding legal issues and
                      policy, no vision and forgetting about core goals

                      In the years prior to current management there was quite a bit of work
                      being done to collaborate with Brussels and international business
                      communities. This seems to have completely fallen to the side. Instead
                      FSFE seems to focus much more on short term goals like campaigns, which
                      will create a bit of press for a short time before moving on to the next
                      campaign. While campaigns are good they are short term and have limited
                      value without long term follow up. This part is missing.

                      There is no long term vision ("what do we want to achieve with FSFE in

                      the next 5 years?"), there are no ties being forged in the political
                      arena (apart from fringe parties like the Pirate Party or the Green
                      Party, which contributes to being ignored by others), and core goals
                      seem to be forgotten. Instead of working towards strengthening free
                      software's position in Europe and shaping how free software is perceived
                      (both I would consider core goals) the focus has shifted to goals like
                      gender diversity. While these goals are worthy they seem to have
                      replaced (instead of augmented) FSFE's original objective and I don't
                      think this is the right way forward.

                      * No knowledge being institutionalized

                      Knowledge about people, events, and political sensitivities, etc. is not
                      institutionalized. Several times when talking to the president and legal
                      coordinator about topics I became aware that we had already discussed
                      these matters before. However the information was treated as new to the
                      other party. Looking through my notes and e-mail archives later, and
                      talking to other people on the legal team, I confirmed that these topics
                      had indeed been covered already (one example was NIPA from Korea).

                      Additionally, the executive team and staff seem to be unwilling to
                      learn about the people and organizations active in the field (who is
                      who, what are their goals and motivations, where is their place in the
                      hierarchy and so on), despite being nudged repeatedly to be aware and
                      engaged by several people including me. Without this information it is
                      very difficult to operate effectively.

                      * Bad organizational management

                      FSFE feels like it is reverting back to being run like a student union,
                      whereas in the past people tried to make it more professional. FSFE's
                      management makes very basic and unnecessary mistakes unworthy of an
                      organization trying to have global influence. This is hurting FSFE.
                      Even though this has been addressed a few times (by some, including
                      myself) nothing seems to be done to rectify these mistakes. A few cases
                      that I am aware of:

                      - everyone taking leave at the same time (post-FOSDEM), meaning the

                      is fragile, there are no fall backs in place and where they are in place
                      they are not working.

                      * No improvements/personal attacks

                      None of the issues mentioned above are new (and if they are, then QED)
                      and have been mentioned before. What I have noticed when issues are
                      mentioned is that either one of these three things happens:

                      - they fall on deaf ears

                      - they are acknowledged and then ignored

                      - FSFE gets very defensive, or launches personal attacks. The most
                      glaring case was when the vice-president recently came barging in and
                      arrogantly threw insults left and right without understanding any of the
                      background of the situation, and launched a vicious personal attack on
                      two of the previous legal coordinators.

                      All these things combined have tipped the scales and now the negative
                      far outweighs the positive (because there is very little positive left
                      in my opinion). I no longer feel that FSFE is the right place for me,
                      or that it is advancing free software in Europe (especially the legal
                      field) and it is better to focus my energy somewhere else where I can
                      have a more positive impact.

                      Have I been perfect myself? Of course I haven't and I am very aware of
                      where and when I screwed up. But the difference is that I try to learn
                      from it and prevent the mistakes from happening again.

                      As the next step I will unsubscribe from the mailing list (I will stay
                      on the legal network).

                      Good luck FSFE, as you will need it.

   372.       The resignation email from Armijn Hemel emphasises the fact that these are immature
      people who don't solve problems, they just shoot the messenger with personal attacks. That is
      how they behave towards Mr Pocock. He asked good questions about the way the budget
      depends on Google. He asked good questions about the misleading âJoin the FSFEâ form.
      They don't have good answers, they are too immature to admit they got caught doing the wrong
      thing so they resort to systematic personal attacks, libel of Mr Pocock and they even continue to
      do so after he resigns in disgust.

Google Summer of Code mentor / intern grievances, Mr Pocock was mediator, not
culprit
   373.     4 August 2018, Deepanshu Gajbhije from Bhopal, India has a problem with his mentor
      in Google Summer of Code. He contacts Mr Pocock for assistance.

                      I am not sure what should I do here. I have been working hard every day
                      committing 10-12 hours daily trying to the project on my own. I could have said
                      this on the mailing list but it would only make him angry and it could another
                      reason to fail me. So I choose to personally email you to address this issue.

   374.     The emails from interns and other developers demonstrate Mr Pocock is a leader in the
      community who is trusted, professional, accessible and able to get involved and calm things
      down in situations like this. It is important to remember the time commitment and emotional
      commitment of helping all these people. Mr Pocock has received no credit for this effort.

   375.       Rather, one of the reasons the Debianists deliberately seek to libel Mr Pocock is to
      discourage other people reporting bad behavior to Mr Pocock. Being more specific, some of
      the larger companies are concerned that their employees do something wrong and the person
      making a complaint reports the issue to an independent leader such as Mr Pocock.

   376.     In the end, the matter was escalated to Stephanie Taylor, the responsible manager at
      Google and the intern still did not receive his final payment despite having logged the hours.

   377.      Molly de Blanc asked some of the female interns for feedback. Kira Obrezkova from

                      Dear Molly,

                      I thank you for your job during Outreachy round. At the same time I
                      have some feedback. The main thing I want to note is that you do your
                      work not so good. You haven't responded to me and also during the last
                      round of Outreachy you have provide almost to no response to
                      applicants of Outreachy FSF project. I asked some of them and they
                      said that you haven't helped them:
                      https://lists.fsf.org/archive/html/esd-translators/2018-03/index.html
                      . Though, you were a mentor of this project.
                      At the same time, I can't see where you were useful for me. You
                      haven't answered to me, you haven't answered to applicants. So, it
                      would be great if you can improve your usefulness.

                      At the same time, I want to thank my mentor Thorsten Alteholz. He did
                      a great job helping me and I was able to find a new job that fits my
                      interests well.

   378.       In August 2018, Mr Pocock's intern in Google's unpaid Summer of Code (GSoC)
      informed him that she had just got married. This is significant because the Debianists have
      spread rumours about a secret mentor/intern relationship. It seems improbable that the woman
      was dating her mentor in another country at the same time as organising a wedding with a
      fiancÃ© in her own country. The woman has also been defamed by these rumours from the
      Debianists. Mr Pocock's own wedding day was marked by the unexplained death of Adrian von
      Bidder-Senn. This type of thing seems to happen around Debian people.

Arjen Kamphuis

   379.       20 August 2018, Arjen Kamphuis left his hotel in Norway. He was never seen again.

   380.       Mr Kamphuis had been a joint author of the book Information Security for Journalists
      and he was perceived to be an associate of Julian Assange and Wikileaks. These things made
      his disappearance particularly interesting for the media and it received global coverage.

   381.     Remember, Mr Kamphuis had asked Mr Pocock for protection from red tape & Debian.
      Mr Pocock's grandfather left his job in teaching because of red tape.

Mr Pocock's resignation misrepresented as part of blackmail tactics evolve
   382.      27 August 2018. Mr Pocock informed Debianists that he was resigning from mentoring
      in Google Summer of Code and would not do so again in 2019. The Debianists were
      disrespectful towards Mr Pocock's family and continued trying to advance the narrative of
      wrongdoing, they couldn't accept that some people walk away from a voluntary activity.

   383.       September 2018, Pierre-Elliott BÃ©cue from the Debian CRANS "nest" joins the French
      intelligence service Agence Nationale de la SÃ©curitÃ© des SystÃ¨mes d'Information (ANSSI)

   384.       18 September 2018, Google paid $17,200 to a Debian-related bank account.

   385.      On 20 September 2018, Debianists Zini, Jaspert and Wiltshire send an insulting message
      to Mr Pocock telling him that he is not a ârealâ Debian Developer. This message does not say
      anything about âexpulsionâ. They explicitly tell Mr Pocock that they want him to continue
      maintaining packages in Debian. When a developer is caught hacking or something then their
      access rights are immediately revoked. The message subject is âRevoking Debian Developer
      Statusâ. In other words, they are stealing his reputation, it is libel and it is about creating a
      system where some joint authors exercise power over their peers. What Zini has written:

              âBoth Outreachy and Google have raised concerns about your interactionsâ

   386.       Zini admits that this is punishment for protected speech by Mr Pocock and his
      Outreachy intern Renata D'Avila, the woman who wrote the blog âThe right to be included in
      the conversationâ, anticipating the death of Lilie James. Zini admits that Google is exercising
      the influence to enslave people in Debian.

   387.       âSince there is no issue with your technical skill, your key will be added to the Debian
      Maintainers keyring. All packages in which you are currently listed as maintainer or uploader
      will be added to your Debian Maintainer whitelist as soon as possible. You are welcome to
      continue to contribute to Debian, but we want to make it clear that, at this point, you are not
      representing Debian.â

   388.       The above comment makes it clear that we are talking about modern slavery by the
      Debianists, acting for the Google. They want Mr Pocock and other victims to work and they
      continue to cherry-pick the benefits of all their previous work but they are retrospectively
      cancelling their right to speak under the Debian Social Contract. Imagine somebody spends
      time working in a business, the boss gives them a check and then while they are on the way to
      the bank to deposit the check, the boss calls his bank and cancels that check. Point (3) of the
      Debian Social Contract, âWe will not hide problemsâ, with its allusions to the first amendment,
      is a check that these people have bounced with the words quoted above.

   389.       Given that the right to speak was intrinsically associated with the pre-existing rights as a
      joint author, the censorship by the Debianists is even more outrageous than those cases where
      they censor the communications from a new participant in the group.

   390.       Remember in 2017 the Fellowship had elected Mr Pocock as their representative.
      Therefore, his right to speak is even more vital and the Debianists' effort to violate that right is a
      social engineering attack on all the Fellowship, not just Mr Pocock.

   391.       âWe are sending this email privately, leaving its disclosure as your decisionâ

   392.       The Debianists are signalling that public knowledge of this situation will be
      embarrassing to Mr Pocock. Mr Pocock clearly recalls the way the same Debianists falsified
      rape accusations against Dr Appelbaum to undermine his civil rights and his reputation. That
      sentence from the Debianists nurtures a sense of fear in the relationship, in the same sense that
      NXIVM periodically reminded people about collateral to maintain fear in the master/slave
      relationships.

   393.     Nonetheless, despite the promise in the last line of the email that it was sent âprivatelyâ,
      Debianist Lamb was simultaneously telling other people about the shaming scheme.

   394.       This blackmailing was taking place at exactly the same time as the trials of Cardinal Pell
      in Melbourne. As mentioned previously, Mr Pocock's second cousin was in the choir at the
      same time Cardinal Pell was the Archbishop of Melbourne. In fact, Mr Pocock's cousin, who is
      much younger, used to hang out with Mr Pocock two or three times per month during the period
      Mr Pocock was at the National Union of Students. Anybody who has ever been responsible for
      one of the children in the choir has gone through the public records and reports from the Royal
      Commission very thoroughly. Mr Pocock immediately realised that the blackmail situation he
      was exposed to by the Debianists was very similar to the situations created by the paedophiles.
      Remarkably, one of the paedophiles is called Father Daniel, he has stolen the name of Mr
      Pocock and he used it in bad faith. A report published by Broken Rites victims' association tells
      us about a victim 5. Victim 5 wanted to be a priest. Father Daniel told the victim BTH that
      abuse was covered by the âseal of confessionâ and if victim BTH violated the silence, he could
      not be a priest (see both Broken Rites and the un-redacted report for case study 35).

   395.       What we see in both cases is the people exercising coercive control are deliberately
      exploiting the psychology of shame and silence. To be a priest or be a ârealâ Debian Developer
      based on notions of honour and obedience rather than the simple, well established fact that
      copyright law gives every Debian Developer an automatic right to recognition immediately
      upon their participation in the act of authorship.

   396.      In the individual cases, the paedophiles are using their psychological tactics to maintain
      ongoing control of their victims. The Debianists Zini, Jaspert and Wiltshire use these tactics to
      ensure the developers continue working without pay, advancing the jointly created intellectual
      property, even when they are in the sin bin.

   397.        In the context of society at large, the paedophiles wanted to maintain their God-like
      image in the community and the Debianists want to create the image that Debian is âa familyâ
      where everybody is happy and free to speak. Therefore, using the psychological tactics,
      blackmail, to hide information from the community is even more important than using those
      tactics to procure additional services from the victim.

   398.       Focussing on the incident at hand, the blackmail of Mr Pocock on 20 September 2018,
      notice how this case differs from the cases of Daniel Baumann (2014) and Dr Jacob Appelbaum
      (2016). In the case of Appelbaum, the Debianists created a rumour of âharassmentâ and then
      they tried to get somebody else to misreport the rumour as ârapeâ. They wanted publicity at
      any cost. In the case of Baumann, the emails to Baumann were not disclosed to all the Internet,
      they were only sent to the debian-private email list. There are approximately 1,000 developers
      subscribed to the list who were complicit with the shaming of Baumann. In the two cases from
      2018, Mr Pocock and Dr Norbert Preining, the Debianists did not even send any immediate
      communication to debian-private, so it was even more secretive than the Baumann experiment.

   399.       Looking at the difference between these cases, we can see that Dr Appelbaum did most
      of his work in the form of advocacy and philosophical work. This type of work is vital for an
      organisation that really wants to be true to its claimed philosophy. But if Debian is simply a
      front for Google & Co, they would not want people to effectively challenge the Google world-
      view and they would want somebody like Dr Appelbaum as far away as possible.

   400.     On the other hand, Dr Preining and Mr Pocock did a lot more technical work than Dr
      Appelbaum. The quality of the work by Mr Pocock is very high, as commented in the email

       from Debianist Zini. Many other users depend on this work. The external users will not notice
       if Dr Appelbaum disappears but they do notice if people like Mr Pocock are not investigating
       and fixing important security bugs in the software. Therefore, the reason they created this new
       type of punishment for Mr Pocock and Dr Preining is so that the Debianists could do an
       experiment, to see if the victims would continue working for free. This appears to be the first
       motive for the Debianists to use the tactic. The Debianists were testing the waters to see if they
       could be slave masters.

      2010, initiated by the Department of Justice (2010) and a civil class action (2013) examined
      tactics used by a number of large companies to keep salaries down. Google was one of the
      defendants in that previous case. Bruce Perens, one of the first Debian leaders who laid out the
      strategy for splitting the assets into a different association with different members in control,
      was employed at Pixar and Pixar was also a defendant in the High-Tech Employee Antitrust
      Litigation. The presence of some volunteers working under slave-like demotions in Debian is
      not inconsistent with the antitrust case.

   402.       In the case of Mr Pocock, there is a second motive for the Debianists to create this
      super-secret punishment environment, where both the punished and the punishers pretend to be
      silent about the situation. Mr Pocock, due to his connection to the choir of the late Cardinal
      Pell, was very alert to the exploitation of women and youth and he had exchanged written
      communications with multiple parties indicating a risk of abuse in the open source software
      supply chain in Albania. Various multinationals claiming to promote diversity, including
      Mozilla Foundation, had put the Albanian man Elio Qoshi on a pedestal and reported on the
      success of the Albanian diversity project in their newsletters and web sites. Experts suggest it
      takes the average abuse victim 30 years to reveal themselves. In other words, there may be
      victims from Albania who come forward at any time now or in the future. They did not want
      Mr Pocock to be an obvious point of contact for any victims who are about to speak up next.
      Mr Pocock's knowledge of the Albanian situation could be considered a form of reverse
      collateral.

   403.       Based on these two facts, the extraordinary technical work done by Mr Pocock and the
      fear that Mr Pocock has collateral on the Debianists, the email sent to Mr Pocock on 20
      September 2018 was the first time the Debianists appear to be using this more clandestine
      coercive control technique. When they used the same technique on Dr Preining, he was the
      second victim of this technique and it only occurred three months later.

   404.      On 20 September 2018, Within an hour of this blackmail from the Debianists, Mr
      Pocock sent an email resigning from the role as FSFE Fellowship representative. The
      resignation email did not immediately appear on the mailing list for the fellows, it was
      suspended until the next day, 21 September 2018, while the FSFE employees decided if they
      would try to re-write the resignation in terms that would look like an expulsion.

   405.     On 21 September 2018, the FSFE president also sent a very heavy-handed message to
      Mr Pocock to scare him into silence even beyond his resignation. Remember the FBI report,
      NXIVM used a Mexican lawyer to scare former members of their cult.

                      [Matthias Kirschner]:

                      Daniel, let us now also solve the problem regarding your publication of
                      internal information. As written before, please remove the data we
                      requested. Please do so within the next 24 hours. Otherwise, you do not
                      leave me a choice and I will have to get our lawyers involved.

   406.       The âinternal informationâ that FSFE (fake FSF) is trying to hide concerns the budget
      documents revealing the influence of Google donations on the staff salaries. The staff, in turn,
      were shown to be punishing critics of Google. This is like the multi-level master-slave-slave
      relationship created by Keith Raniere at NXIVM.

   407.       Keith Raniere did not want women to know that he was at the top of the pyramid in the
      âDOSâ secret society. Debian and FSFE (fake FSF) do not want their unpaid volunteers to
      realise the extent to which Google is at the top of the open source ecosystem, influencing both
      the philosophy and the technical direction of projects, exploiting people's work without paying
      for their effort. The FBI obtained evidence to prove that Raniere was in fact the controller and
      Mr Pocock published evidence to prove that Google is exercising coercive control.

   408.      The FSFE Fellows were relied on to do substantial work without pay for FSFE (fake
      FSF), an organisation deriving 60% of their funds from multinationals like Google. The role of
      Fellowship representative was their only right to representation in the constitution of the FSFE
      e.V. The fact that the FSFE managers were willing to tamper with the communications of the
      representative means that this representative role couldn't function properly and the fellows

       were being deceived. Given that they were providing their work without pay under this
       deceptive promise of representation, the overall arrangement was an exploitation of labour. The
       plan to lend the volunteers to other organisations demonstrates how vital it was to have a
       responsible adult like Mr Pocock involved on behalf of volunteers.

   409.        On 20 September 2018 the Debian Project Leader Chris Lamb sent a reply to Elio Qoshi
      in relation to Qoshi's âcomplaintâ from March. Recall, Qoshi was using Albanian women and
      the goodwill towards the non-profit Open Labs association to obtain money from diversity
      budgets and direct the money into his private company Ura Design. Mr Pocock discovered this
      diversity money had gone astray and simultaneously made a protected whistleblower complaint
      to another sponsor, Mozilla Foundation, about the risk to underage participants. In reprisal,
      Qoshi had sent a âcomplaintâ about being caught, which he mentioned in the public discussion
      about FOSSCamp. Lamb had never shared details of Qoshi's âcomplaintâ with Mr Pocock.
      Now, without any discussion between Lamb and Mr Pocock, Lamb has replied to Qoshi's
      âcomplaintâ by denouncing Mr Pocock.

   410.      Elio Qoshi, the founder who had brought his underage girlfriend to tech conferences,
      received the libellous reply from Lamb and distributed it to other people as a reprisal for the
      work Mr Pocock did supporting the Albanian female whistleblowers.

   411.      The female Albanian whistleblowers who had asked Mr Pocock for support were
      shocked and confused that Lamb, who purports to represent Debian as the leader, was siding
      with the paedophile who brings an underage girlfriend to tech conferences.

   412.       Mr Pocock, who's cousin was offered the choir scholarship in Melbourne, has regrets
      about failing to detect what was allegedly going on there. But he has no regrets about
      investigating the way women were exploited in this case and would ask the same questions
      again. He had a duty to his Debian co-authors to ensure that Debian money was not lost in a
      scam like that.

   413.      Between 20 and 22 September the Debianists put offensive changes into the Debian
      keyring, seeking to discredit Mr Pocock. This was at a very difficult time of grief for Mr
      Pocock and his family.

   414.      It appears that Lamb had denounced Mr Pocock like this to start a social media scandal.
      There was no wrongdoing by Mr Pocock, quite the opposite, Mr Pocock was being punished for
      being diligent. Nonetheless, given that Lamb had never given Mr Pocock the opportunity to see
      or respond to any complaints, Lamb was not even aware of the investigation conducted by
      Mozilla Foundation, therefore Lamb was guilty of negligence in carrying out his responsibility
      as Debian Project Leader.

   415.      Mozilla Foundation regarded Mr Pocock as a witness and multiple messages from the
      women confirm that Mr Pocock was a witness, who went there as a volunteer and provided
      support. Lamb never thanked Mr Pocock for his efforts, he just turned it into a social media
      scandal for his snobby friends around Cambridge.

   416.       Moreover, because Lamb and the Albanian had started distributing these messages about
      a secret complaint behind Mr Pocock's back, it created the situation where Mr Pocock had no
      choice other than putting the facts in public, including the names and emails, so people can see
      what everybody else had been saying for over a year, the Albanian men Elio Qoshi and Redon
      Skikuli were the origin of the problem.

   417.      This was also entirely consistent with the way other Debian people had distributed the
      names of Sven Luther and Dr Jacob Appelbaum. However, in this case, the necessity to publish
      the names existed because Mr Pocock had to rebut the rumours started by Lamb.

   418.        If Lamb and other key Debian figures had met in person and discussed the problems
      earlier in the year it may have been possible to avoid publishing names and other details.

   419.       At the same time, one of Mr Pocock's former classmates, a psychiatrist in Australia,
      really was facing disciplinary action for a relationship with a female patient. The relationship,
      admitted before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT), involved getting the
      patient pregnant, coercing the patient to have an abortion and then deceiving fellow medical
      professionals about the nature of the relationship during the process of procuring the abortion.
      The psychiatrist was given a one year suspension and returned to practice. Mr Pocock, Linus
      Torvalds, Dr Richard Stallman, Dr Norbert Preining, Dr Jacob Appelbaum, Sonny Piers, Dr Roy
      Schestowitz, Bryan Lunduke, Sven Luther, Phil Wyett and others who simply asked ethical
      questions under protection of the first amendment have been subject to life sentences of
      vilification by the Debianist cyberbullies.

   420.       The Scientology cult regards Psychiatry as a cult and they banned it.

   421.       Consider the disparity in outcomes between a real case of misconduct, the psychiatrist
      suspended for a year while victims of gossip campaigns are vilified for life. Observing this
      disparity only adds to the emotional distress suffered by Mr Pocock and others who value the
      long overdue need for ethics in computing.

   422.       Since the psychiatrist case became public in 2019, some of the Debianists, including
      Paul Tagliamonte and Hideki Yamane have conducted a campaign of harassment with jibes
      about mental health directed at Mr Pocock. This is a further example of extreme privacy
      violation trolling as Carla's eating disorder is actually the most fatal mental health condition.

   423.      In October 2018 the Debianist Chris Lamb dismissed Mr Pocock's concerns about abuse
      and concerns about the health of his father as âminutiaeâ. In fact, on the topic of abuse in
      Albania, Australian citizens are subject to a law about mandatory reporting of abuse-related
      tourism. Mr Pocock has multiple nationalities, including Australia, so discussing what was
      observed in Albania is anything but âminutiaeâ. From the Australian government's âSmart
      Travellerâ service: âIt's also a crime to not report a child sex offence that you know about.â

   424.      8 to 9 November 2018, Chris Lamb (Debian) and Matthias Kirschner (FSFE) are both at
      the SFSCon in Bolzano, Italy.

   425.      Kirschner writes a report about the meeting with Lamb at SFSCon where he comments
      âOne general wish -- which I agreed with -- from Debian was to better share information about
      peopleâ. These tactics violate privacy rights in many countries. It shows that there is an
      element of conspiracy and coercive control between the different non-profit foundations funded
      by Google. They are trying to herd and coerce the co-authors to be useful to some hidden
      paymasters.

   426.       Kirschner and Lamb were both independently funded by Google behind the scenes.
      Kirschner also admitted he sometimes received speaking fees independently of the Google
      sponsorship payments to FSFE. This underhanded arrangement between them to control the
      behavior of fellow authors, deriving revenue for themselves without revealing the revenue to
      others, simultaneously coordinating punishments across supposedly independent non-profit

       associations, amounts to conspiracy and racketeering. Remember the plot where FSFE
       volunteers would do tasks for Open Knowledge Foundation.

Cyberbullying, Cardinal Pell gossip erupts at Christmas, civil rights trampled on
   427.       18 November 2018, Lars Wirzenius writes a public blog post about âRetiring from
      Debianâ for the third time, âIâve had a rough year, and Debian has also stopped being fun for
      me. Thereâs a number of Debian people saying and doing things that I find disagreeable, â and
      he continues âIâm tired of people who should know better tearing open old wounds. Iâm tired of
      all the unconstructive and aggressive whinging, from Debian contributors and users alike. Iâm
      tired of trying to make things better and running into walls of negativity. (I realise Iâm not being
      the most constructive with this blog post and with my retirement. Iâm tired.)â

   428.      After all that, wouldn't it be a good idea for the volunteers to have a restful Christmas
      season?

   429.       26 to 28 November 2018, Mr Pocock visited the UN Forum on Business and Human
      Rights in Geneva. At a session on Safeguarding Human Rights Defenders, Mr Pocock made a
      brief intervention, reminding the activists in the room that social media bosses are not on their
      side. The video is available online. It appears that this further enraged some of the Debianists
      who pretend to care about freedom and privacy while simultaneously working for these very
      influential companies.

               I'd like to ask you about the responsibilities of tech companies, those in Silicon Valley.
               They often give activists and human rights defenders a false sense of empowerment but
               in fact the data being harvested by companies like Facebook and Twitter is extremely
               convenient for those who don't have the best interests of human rights defenders at
               heart.

   430.       On 13 December 2018, Cardinal George Pell was convicted of abuse in Australia. The
      conviction was subject to reporting restrictions in Australia but widely covered in media reports
      in the US, Europe and other parts of the world.

   431.        17 December 2018, when Dr Norbert Preining's blog was censored by the Debianists,
      Mr Pocock rose to the defence of Dr Preining. Mr Pocock has a long history of sticking up for
      the little guy, including his defence of Michael Kappes, Dr Norbert Preining, Dr Jacob
      Appelbaum, Dr Richard Stallman and the Albanian female whistleblowers.

   432.      18 December 2018, Dr Norbert Preining sends a message to Mr Pocock. Dr Preining
      had applied for a job in New York and he suspects Lamb used his position as Debian leader to
      stab Dr Preining in the back. There are a bunch of misfits who think they are holier-than-thou
      and look down their noses at everybody else. This is how the misfits use the reputation of the
      software as a tool to cause social and economic harm for fellow co-authors.

                      even if, going through a lawsuite like this in the UK is out and above
                      my abilities and financial possibilities.
                      But I am scared that Lamb actually also hosed an application for a
                      company in NY, a job related to Debian. If that has happened, and I can
                      reasonably document it, I would consider a defamation law suite.

                      Thanks for the links, I will keep them in mind.

   433.      On 24 December 2018, shortly after the conviction of Cardinal George Pell, on
      Christmas Eve, the Debian Project, Debianists Joerg Jaspert, Jonathan Wiltshire and Enrico Zini
      spread rumours that Mr Pocock was involved in abuse. These rumours cascaded into social
      media gossip throughout the Christmas season. This caused enormous apprehension for Mr
      Pocock as he remembered the way the same snobby people on social media whipped up a mob
      to vandalise Dr Appelbaum's home.

   434.      Simultaneously, he was concerned the misfits were using these privacy violations about
      abuse to draw attention to his much younger second cousin in the choir and to Carla's medical
      condition.

   435.       On 25 December 2018 Martin Krafft reveals that he is another victim:

              I know that thereâs been at least another case, in which DAM and AH have acted outside
              their mandate, threatening with project expulsion, and choosing very selectively with
              whom they communicate. I know, because I was being targeted. Neither DAM nor AH
              (the same people still active today) made a single attempt to hear me. None of my e-
              mails to either DAM or AH were ever answered. Instead, DAM ruled a verdict, and
              influenced other people to the point that âbecause DAM ruledâ was given as a reason
              for other measures. This was an unconstitutional abuse of DAMâs powers, and in the
              case of AH, the whole mess also bordered on libel. Among others, the current DPL Chris
              Lamb promised a review in due time, but nothing ever happened.

   436.       26 December 2018 Dr Norbert Preining thanks Mr Pocock and publishes some of the
      insults he received, the full message is in the public debian-project archive:

                      From: Norbert Preining <norbert@preining.info>

                      Hi everyone,

                      (please Cc me, I am not subscribed to d-p)

                      first of all thanks to Daniel for bringing this up and standing up for
                      me, this is very much appreciated.

                      For those not aware of the issue, here is *my* view onto the events.
                      AH and DAM can answer and provide their own interpretation. I will try
                      to stay as objective as it is possible for me.

   437.       Please consider the significance of this. Mr Pocock, who's cousin in Cardinal George
      Pell's choir in the late 1990s used to hang out with him a couple of times per month, was there
      for the Albanian female whistleblowers in 2017 and then started a #MeToo movement for men
      who had been blackmailed and shamed by Google-serving Debianists in 2018. The survivors,
      people like Martin Krafft and Dr Norbert Preining, had been shamed in secret. The Debianists
      hoped that shame would prevent the victims from communicating with each other.

   438.    Having an effective way to keep people silent, by exploiting the power of shame, is a
      common theme for both the paedophiles and the Debianists. This is not to say the Debianists

       are paedophiles, but they have created an environment where somebody like that would be able
       to operate with impunity.

   439.      The Debianists don't pay the joint authors for their work. Some of them, like the
      Debianist Enrico Zini, appear to be on much lower salaries than the senior developers. The only
      way men like Zini can exert influence is through blackmailing. By helping victims to overcome
      shame, Mr Pocock has blunted the weapon of blackmail. The Debianists resent losing their
      power.

   440.      When you realise the significance of what Mr Pocock has done, getting the blackmail
      victims to overcome shame and reveal themselves in public, you can see why the Debianists
      have such a huge motive for reprisals against Mr Pocock.

   441.       By bringing all the resignations and shaming victims into the public sphere, by bringing
      the skeletons of the suicide cluster out of the closet, Mr Pocock has demonstrated that the talk
      about Debian being a âfamilyâ and a âcommunityâ is bullshit.

   442.      On 31 December 2018 Chris Lamb sends a public report admitting he accepted a large
      but obfuscated donation from Google.

US Bill of Rights, Debian Social Contract burnt in New Year's Eve bonfire
   443.       On 28 December 2018 Mr Pocock expresses public concern about the cyberbullying in a
      message where he warns âPlease take a moment and think about what is the worst that
      eventually happens when a community (or it's leader) abuses members in this way indefinitely.â
      with a link to a cyberbullying and suicide research fact sheet.

   444.       One month later another joint author, Lucy Wayland, died in the UK. The coroner
      declared the death to be an accident while recovering from a medical problem. Nonetheless, it
      is clear that vulnerable people were exposed to the culture of shaming and Christmas
      punishments.

   445.      Upon Mr Pocock's prediction of more death, Alexander Wirt (formorer) of the Debian
      mailing list censorship team began censoring messages from Mr Pocock. Herr Wirt, who is in
      Germany, sent a message to Mr Pocock explaining that his emails were now subject to
      censorship:

              I don't want to get too much into details, but phrases like "sustained this state of
              hostility" or "wayward" are not acceptable.

   446.       Wirt's explanation reveals the state of hostility, derived from shaming, was a sore point
      for the gangmasters. In other words, Wirt's immediate action to censor Mr Pocock was not well
      founded, it was indeed a reprisal. As well as being a reprisal, the censorship was a tactic to
      undermine Mr Pocock's efforts to help more survivors overcome shame and speak up.

   447.       The Fellowship community had elected Mr Pocock as their representative so these
      efforts to censor Mr Pocock for being a good representative are even more outrageous.

   448.       At the same time, Mike Hoye at the Mozilla Foundation censored Mr Pocock's blog
      from their Planet Mozilla syndication service. The Mozilla manifesto tells us, among other
      things:

                      The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness,
                      innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the internet.

                      ...

                      Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability
                      and trust.

   449.       Mr Pocock did not receive any explanation from Mozilla. Remember, the Albanian
      bringing the underage girlfriend to tech conferences was funded as a Mozilla Tech Speaker and
      it appears they hoped to bury that story using technical means, contrary to the principles in the
      Mozilla Manifesto and the first amendment.

   450.       People have spent decades collaborating and contributing their work in the belief that
      the principles of the first amendment are intertwined with some kind of Debian philosophy.
      The first amendment has limits, for example, it is not acceptable to distribute abuse images.
      Using the word âwaywardâ is simply not comparable to that. What we see here is a word-nazi
      who is going through every message with a fine-tooth comb and nit-picking about the words
      that people use in case they might irritate somebody else who gets exposed doing sneaky stuff.

   451.       Mr Pocock was censored for expressing legitimate concerns about the mental health
      impact of cyberbullying in Debian. The rumours about âabuseâ, âharassmentâ and âbehaviorâ
      were totally false and those rumours were started by Debianists to cover up the fact they censor
      people for raising ethical questions about unpaid work. The concerns expressed by Mr Pocock
      are entirely legitimate first amendment protected speech.

   452.       The theme at the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights in November 2018 had
      been âStand up for Human Rightsâ. The evidence in these emails shows very clearly what it
      looks like when one of the joint authors stands up for the human rights of his peers. Why does
      he experience such vicious reprisals?

   453.       7 January 2019, Joerg Jaspert makes another reprisal, censoring the blog of Mr Pocock
      in the Debian Planet web site, in violation of the Debian Social Contract and first amendment.

   454.       In the same reprisal, Joerg Jaspert includes a libellous comment about abuse in the
      configuration file for the Debian Planet web site. The libel is committed to the Git repository.
      The libel has been constructed to violate the privacy of Mr Pocock and his family, to cause
      distress and to incite others to engage in reprisals against Mr Pocock.

   455.      January 2019, many more messages are exchanged about censorship. Scott Kitterman
      writes

                      If censorship isnât the right word (and at best, itâs not ideal), whatâs the right
                      word for the chilling effect on willingness to speak in public due to the risk of
                      being ejected from an organization like Debian? Perhaps if we can get past âitâs
                      not censorshipâ and say what it is, then we can make some progress. ... Iâm
                      talking about declining to speak based on concern about disproportionate

                      did or didnât happen in any recent situation - I am trying to see if there is some
                      consensus to be found on at least how to talk about it).

   456.      9 January 2019, Ian Jackson, a former leader of Debian, writes a message admitting that
      they didn't have sufficient reasons for the punishments meted out at Christmas and asking
      people to âPlease search your communications archivesâ because âit may become necessary to
      produce a fuller list of incidents, including responses, to justify the recent DAM decisionâ. In
      the email, Jackson, a former leader of Debian, explains that he wants to build a dirt file on Dr
      Preining.

FOSDEM: from NXIVM cage to Cat behind bars, female speaker trafficked to
criminal speech jurisdiction
   457.       Saturday, 2 February 2019 at FOSDEM in Brussels, Molly de Blanc, being president of
      the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and Strategic Initiative Manager for the GNOME Foundation
      gives a talk about being an enforcer. The video is available online.

   458.       She singles out Mr Pocock for humiliation without naming him. She uses a slide with a
      picture of a cat behind bars and repeats the nonsense about being able to âexpelâ authors, when
      the extinction of authorship rights is simply not possible.

   459.       Molly de Blanc's cat-behind-bars picture triggers NXIVM gossip. Cat pictures are so
      common that it is possible de Blanc has chosen it by coincidence. It is also possible she has
      either subconsciously or consciously been influenced by the high profile news coverage of the
      NXIVM cage. Or maybe people only made the NXIVM connection later in the year as the trial
      and sentencing got into full swing. Nonetheless, the cage shown at FOSDEM and the NXIVM
      cage have converged psychologically.

   460.      In any case, this was the FOSDEM's Legal and Policy room and they encouraged this
      cage mentality, Mr Pocock was targetted with this just weeks before his father died.
      Coincidentally, the birthday of Mr Pocock's father is at the beginning of February, the same
      week as FOSDEM every year.

   461.       Of particular interest, she describes how instead of going to law school, she went to
      Sage Sharp (Otter Tech) âonline training for Code of Conduct enforcement skillsâ. In other
      words, gobbledygook, or witchcraft. In her talk, she admits they have abandoned due process,
      they receive secret complaints from secret victims and every one or two weeks they go to their
      cubby house and draw up a list of punishments. At no stage do they present the evidence to the
      accused or give the accused a right of reply. They have abandoned every development in
      natural justice since the creation of the Magna Carta. This is the stuff of witchcraft indeed.
      FOSDEM hosted the talk in the so-called âLegal and Policy Issuesâ track. Nobody in the
      audience called her out. She used slides with cat pictures to humiliate Mr Pocock and his
      family, who also had cats, therefore, this was an incident of Intentional Infliction of Emotional
      Distress on the part of OSI, GNOME and FOSDEM.

   462.       FOSDEM is in Belgium, a country with criminal speech laws and jail terms for those
      who are convicted. Therefore, we need to consider that Molly de Blanc is both a perpetrator of
      defamation and a victim of human trafficking at the same time. The senior developers are
      mostly men and they don't want to get caught publicly insulting somebody. It seems somebody
      has been whispering things to Miss de Blanc. As an American, she is more likely to say some
      offensive things that a Belgian would not say in their own country. Nonetheless, if other people
      have booked her flight ticket to Belgium and encouraged her to denounce people while she is in
      that country then they have used her to do something that would have criminal consequences.
      Such arrangements are typically considered to be exploitation. Exploitation, combined with
      international travel, is the definition of human trafficking.

   463.        In the same FOSDEM talk, de Blanc encourages people to use a âwhisper networkâ as a
      substitute for professional interactions with their colleagues. This appears to be another attempt
      at vilification, to create a pandemic of gossip and raise a mob.

   464.       6 February 2019, Pierre-Elliott BÃ©cue, who now works for ANSSI in the French
      intelligence services, repeats the accusations that cyberbullying victims are "innocent" and
      helps to perpetuate the vilification of these people.

   465.      18 February 2019 a report by the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport
      Committee stated âCompanies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like âdigital
      gangstersâ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the lawâ. The
      committee failed to trademark the term 'digital gangsters' and now it is used far and wide.

Ubisoft, Mozilla & Debian linked
   466.       Sylvestre Ledru, a Mozilla employee and Debian Developer had previously been an
      administrator in the Google Summer of Code internships. In his role with Mozilla, he publishes
      a blog post about Mozilla and Ubisoft working together on Clever-Commit, an Artificial
      Intelligence coding assistant from Ubisoft La Forge. This is significant because Ubisoft
      executives were subsequently found guilty on charges of real abuse and harassment, as opposed
      to the fake rumours of abuse and harassment we see in so many of these cult-like groups.
      Notice the pattern: executives with money have impunity and people fawn in front of them but
      when independent community representatives like Mr Pocock speak up for women, they are
      subject to reprisals and counter-accusations.

Cardinal George Pell enters prison, death of Mr Pocock's father, victims forced to
make confession under duress
   467.      26 February 2019 Cardinal George Pell was put into custody. In March 2019 he was
      given a six year sentence.

   468.      Mr Pocock's father and uncle were former employees of the Archdiocese of Melbourne
      from the Pell era. Mr Pocock discussed the prosecution with his father. His father was clearly
      disturbed by the scandal.

   469.        22 March 2019, in the middle of all that, Dr Preining writes a forced confession email to
      the public debian-project mailing list. Mr Pocock was reminded of the case of Father James
      Scannell, a priest who forced boys to make confession after being abused. âI understand that
      the criticism of my original blog text was validâ and âI also will take care to listen carefully to
      advice and correctionsâ and finally âIn cooperation with DAM - and the invaluable help of
      some fellow DDs - we have reached the agreement about my further status. DAM will write
      about this in a separate email outlining the agreement and consequences.â. This was obviously
      an email written under duress. It follows the pattern described in Russ Allbery's email from
      May 2013.

   470.       On 17 April 2019, the wedding anniversary and the Wednesday of Holy Week, the new
      Archbishop Comensoli of the Melbourne diocese published an Easter message on Google's
      YouTube where he acknowledges the grief in the community. Mr Pocock's father died three
      days later on Easter Saturday, which was also the birthday of Hitler.

Post-censorship: Google $300,000 semi-disclosed, Albanian distanced but not
banned
   472.      In May 2019 Sam Hartman, the incoming Debian Project Leader, sends an email giving
      the impression that the magnitude of the obfuscated donation from Google was $300,000.

   473.        18 and 19 May, 2019, the annual OSCAL conference in Tirana, Albania. Elio Qoshi, the
      man who had the 16 year old girlfriend in 2017, is not in the photos of the organising team. But
      he is still in the big group photo and this time he has his arm around the girl. We see the
      Debianists are willing to tolerate the guy who brings an underage girlfriend to tech conferences
      but they want to totally ostracise and libel people like Dr Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, Dr
      Norbert Preining and Mr Pocock. These men who suffer lifetime discrimination never did
      anything more than asking a few ethical questions.

   474.      In the photo gallery, most of the Albanians are wearing t-shirts with sponsors' logos
      while Elio Qoshi is wearing a black polo shirt without any logos on it.

   475.       Recall, Elio Qoshi was a Mozilla Tech Speaker, Mr Pocock had tipped off the Mozilla
      investigation in October 2017 and a few months prior to the OSCAL 2019 conference, Mozilla
      censored Mr Pocock's blog from their syndication service. Mozilla is a sponsor of the
      conference again in 2019 and the man is still there.

   476.       The reason why the Albanian man can still come to these events is not clear. As a co-
      founder of the group, he has the list of every employee of the tech companies who visited the
      parties in Albania. There is a perception that he knows how to get girls and this is supported by
      some of the photos where we see a team of three men with twenty or more female volunteers.

Leaking intern's mental health status: Google Summer of Code mentors list
   477.      On 6 July 2019, Mr Pocock sent an email to the Google Summer of Code Mentors
      mailing list expressing concern that people are sharing medical details receiving from their

       interns. The email also points out that this whole problem could be avoided if Google ran an
       insurance scheme for the remote interns. Under the existing system, if an intern gets sick or has
       an accident, they have to negotiate with their mentor to get some special arrangement or get
       thrown out of the program. This is very different from a normal internship where the intern
       simply gives their doctor's letter to HR. Due to the fact every case is different, the mentors
       typically relay the intern medical queries on the mailing list and ask people for ideas about
       whether the medical condition is real or not.

   478.     On 8 July 2019 Mr Pocock sent an email to the mailing list for Google's unpaid Summer
      of Code mentors, reminding the mentors that some of them have rights under the GDPR. Chris

              Hi Everyone,

              Chris DiBona here, I look after open source programs at google. I wanted to mention,
              while many of you know this, Daniel is not an employee or contractor of google and is
              not an authority on how to submit gdpr or other legal filings with google. I'd suggest if
              you'd like to see some information on GDPR, who it applies to and how one might file
              and what one might expect, that you look at our page on the topic,
              here: https://privacy.google.com/businesses/compliance/#!?modal_active=none You
              should also speak with your own, local, lawyer and/or government body as that page is
              obviously google's legal apparatus and not your own.

              Thanks for working on the Summer of Code, we really appreciate it and more
              importantly, I think it is a vitally important program for the ongoing health of free and
              open source software. I would also say that while we've had a few tricky people over
              the years, given the vast number of people we've had in the program as mentors and
              mentees, it's really been an extremely minor part of the summer of code. So thanks
              again!

   479.      Subsequent actions by the cyberbullies appear to be a reprisal for Mr Pocock's interest in
      privacy topics.

   480.       By asserting that copyright can be extinguished, asserting that some joint authors have
      no rights to recognition, reneging upon the Debian Social Contract with its allusions to the first
      amendment, the Debianists are insulting and rubbing out people who created and advanced the
      creative works under those terms.

   481.       DiBona asserts the Google Summer of Code is âa vitally important program for the
      ongoing health of free and open source softwareâ. In fact, it is the other way around: remember
      the bed-ridden Joel âEspyâ Klecker doing unpaid work in the 1990s up to the point where he
      died from Duchenne muscular dystrophy? Remember Chris Rutter working up to 3am in his
      dorm room until the night he had an accident and got run over? That unpaid work was vitally
      important creating the foundation for companies like Google and Facebook who only arrived on
      the scene much later. Google may not exist in its current form if unpaid teenagers hadn't helped
      create Linux and related GNU project works back in the 1990s.

Debian leader Sam Hartman propagates social engineering attack to Fedora Planet
   482.      20 July 2019 leader of the Debianists, Sam Hartman sends a message to somebody at
      Fedora (IBM Red Hat) asking to censor the blog of Mr Pocock.

   483.      Sam Hartman: Daniel says "Debian Developers who spoke up about abusive leadership
      are obstructed from competing in elections." He links to an article, where it turns out that he
      was not permitted to participate in a Debian election.

   484.      In response, the Fedora Planet service (Red Hat syndication of blogs from volunteers)
      censors Mr Pocock's blog and opens a censorship dispute in their Pagure system, Pagure ticket
      249.

   485.       The heading of the Pagure ticket is "[CoC] Issue #249: Debian request re: Fedora
      Planet", which implies that Debianists requested the censorship by waiving around references
      to their CoC gaslighting.

OSI President Molly de Blanc promotes civil disorder (federal felony)
   486.       On 11 August 2019, the president of the Open Source Initiative (OSI), Molly de Blanc,
      gave a keynote speech at FrOSCon14 in Germany. She displays a slide showing three people
      pushing one of the joint authors. In the world of open source software, Molly and her
      colleagues don't pay for the work that the authors are publishing. de Blanc states early in the
      talk that she has no budget to pay people and goes on to say âWe can use our collective power
      to push othersâ. The drawing by the former OSI president shows us the Federal felony crime of
      civil disorder.

           Civil disorder (federal felony) definition: A public disturbance involving acts of violence by
           assemblages of three or more persons, which causes an immediate danger of or results in
           damage or injury to the property or person of any individual.

   487.       The OSI president is inciting others to commit the crime. Recalling the harassment of
      Dr Appelbaum in 2016, Mr Pocock felt great apprehension about these narratives. Chapter 12,
      231(a)(1) teaching techniques for civil disorder is a federal felony, even if cyberbully de Blanc
      did not plan to personally push anybody with her own hands.

   488.       In the same talk, at FrOSCon14, the OSI President tells people that she can't write code
      herself and she has no money to pay people to write code for her so she needs volunteers. This
      reflects the motives for all of the Debianists and other freeloader organisations who are looking
      for ways to trick people into doing work for some philosophical motive that ends up on the
      slippery slope to slavery and exploitation.

Female interns offered trip to Brazil, asked to denounce Mr Pocock
   489.      August 2019, some of the Albanian and Kosovan women who thanked Mr Pocock for
      his support are given free trips to DebConf19 in Brazil. In a telephone call afterwards, one of
      these women tells Mr Pocock that while she was in Brazil, all-expenses-paid trip, she was
      encouraged to denounce Mr Pocock. Google was one of the sponsors of DebConf.

   490.      At the conference dinner, four of these women were sitting at the table with the outgoing
      leader Chris Lamb. Aigars Mahinovs, a BMW employee from Germany, went around the room
      with his camera and photographed the group at that table from every direction. He published
      the photos on a Flickr account.

   491.       Mr Pocock was not present at the conference and had not involvement in the
      photography or publication. The Debianists have spread rumours that Mr Pocock was
      responsible for the embarrassment of the women but it is very easy to find the photos originated
      in the Flickr account of Aigars Mahinovs.

   492.       Remember, in 2015, Margarita Manterola from Google had told Mr Pocock he could not
      bring his spouse to the dinner or accommodation but in 2019, the outgoing leader, Chris Lamb,
      had this whole group of Albanian women at his table. It appears that rules are not created or
      applied consistently, there are different rules for different people.

Debian.community domain name was only registered long after character attacks
began
   493.        23 October 2019, the debian.community Internet domain name was registered for the
      first time but it was not used immediately.

   494.      This is significant because the rogue Debianists frequently claim the dispute arose
      because of the dissenting opinions and leaks published on the now-censored debian.community
      web site.

   495.      As we can see from the chronological history, the vendettas to censor ethical questions
      and discredit the people asking ethical questions had started between 2016 and 2018. The
      censorship had all started long before the registration of the domain name for an independent
      debian.community site in October 2019.

   496.      The rogue Debianists claim in their public defamation that the content of the
      debian.community web site is the origin of the dispute.

   497.       The real reason the FSFE (fake FSF) and rogue Debianists started censoring ethical
      questions in 2018 has been hidden from us and the references to the debian.community dispute
      and other domain name/trademark nit-picking disputes are an attempt to divert attention from
      the fact the most severe violations of the first amendment began in 2018.

Transgender activists stalking Mr Pocock and his family, Zizian mentality
   498.       Between 2019 and 2022, Mr Pocock continued to observe associates of the Debianists
      trying to stir up rumours. By way of example, chat messages were logged by Techrights. One
      of the transgender activists, Ariadne Conill (Edera, Alpine Linux), repeatedly visits the
      Techrights chat channel to spread rumours suggesting Mr Pocock was engaged in a relationship
      with an intern. Witnesses have suggested Ariadne Conill was also at the DebConf19 in Brazil.

   499.       Nonetheless, the women had no problem working with Mr Pocock. The stories were
      entirely fabricated and offensive to the women.

   500.      In October 2019 some of the female Albanian whistleblowers met Mr Pocock in
      Switzerland where they incorporated a new association, Open Source Diversity, and opened a
      Swiss bank account without the involvement of their male overlords from Tirana.

   501.      The female Albanian whistleblowers appear to be familiar with the history of all
      Albanian youth who participated in their hackerspace. It is telling that the women
      knowledgable about that history have been given a series of internships and jobs in
      organisations affiliated with Debianists and other cyberbullies.

   502.       December 2019, the young Albanian woman who was photographed sitting closest to
      the former leader at the DebConf19 dinner was given an Outreachy internship just a few weeks
      after the conference.

   503.      Upon becoming entangled in the financial dependency of employment, the female
      Albanian whistleblowers ceased giving Mr Pocock details about the history of abuse.

   504.        21 January 2020, a news report in the Osthessen Zeitung (local newspaper) declares that
      Debianist Joerg Jaspert, who engaged in cyberbullying by creating libellous rumours of abuse
      the previous Christmas, has been elected as a parent representative on a board for the school
      district (Stadtelternbeirats) representing Dalbergschule Fulda.

   505.     The newspaper features a picture of Jaspert in his Debian t-shirt with two other parents.
      The Debian logo on the t-shirt is the same as the logo on the tombstones of at least two people
      who died.

EPFL (Swiss polytechnique university, Lausanne) lab asks Mr Pocock to do unpaid
open source software work under guise of job application
   506.     January 2020, Mr Pocock had discussed an employment opportunity with a lab at the
      EPFL, a leading Swiss polytechnique (research university) in Lausanne.

   507.     The lab team had asked Mr Pocock to do a small project as a test. Mr Pocock realized it
      was more than a week's work. Normally, companies ask new employees to do tests of this size

       during their paid probationary period but the EPFL lab was asking job seekers to do these tests
       before issuing a contract.

   508.      Mr Pocock discovered the test had already been identified as a missing feature in the
      open source "qemu" emulator project. It was referred to in Sourceforge in 2015 and two
      researchers at Cambridge had published a paper about the theme (Fast TLB Simulation for
      RISC-V Systems) six months before Mr Pocock's discussion with the EPFL lab. Therefore, the
      EPFL lab wasn't asking Mr Pocock to perform some abstract test, they were asking him to
      complete unpaid work that had been anticipated in advance.

   509.      Mr Pocock discussed the situation with his legal insurer and they agreed to pay for the
      work on an ex-gratia basis rather than pursuing the EPFL for the exploitation of jobseekers and
      open source volunteers. Such as lawsuit would have been very embarassing for Switzerland.

   510.      The EPFL and this lab in particular has received funding from some of the controlling
      corporations, including Google and IBM.

   511.      Remember, healthcare bills amounting to tens of thousands of francs had arisen because
      of Carla's eating disorder but other Swiss institutions were asking Mr Pocock to work without
      any pay at all.

Public vilification of Mr Pocock's family continues after death of father
   512.      On 3 March 2020, it is now more than a year that Mr Pocock has been under the
      psychological strain of this blackmailing / slavery experiment and it gets worse. The Debian
      leader Sam Hartman sends another outrageous message calling for vilification of Mr Pocock.

           âI decided to ban someone from the project completely

           âThe person had already been banned from our lists and expelled from the project as a
           developer

   513.      If the person has already been banned, why does Debianist Hartman have to send
      another message like this? How can you ban somebody if they are already banned? This is
      what vilification looks like.

           âIf you don't care about the constitutional complexities of Debian, stop reading

   514.       The reference to âconstitutional complexitiesâ only confirms there is gaslighting and the
      crime of coercive control. What about basic human rights, or Mr Pocock's and other victims'
      rights to ongoing recognition under Copyright law? Authors can't be âexpelledâ or âbannedâ.
      Mr Pocock, Debianists and all the other victims are simply equals under the law of Copyright.

   515.      Upon seeing Hartman's outburst, Mr Pocock felt great apprehension that Sam Hartman's
      mob would vandalise his home (as in the case of Dr Appelbaum, Berlin) or cause him physical
      harm (as in the case of Ted Walther, DebConf6).

   516.      Hartman was elected in the same month Mr Pocock's father died. Hartman spent the
      whole year vilifying Mr Pocock and encouraging others to do so.

   517.       In April 2020, Jonathan Carter was elected Debian Project Leader and he continued the
      practice of vilifying Mr Pocock through the painful years of the Covid pandemic.

Mr Pocock raises alarm about censorship on Fedora Planet, violation of Fedora
Foundations
   518.      March 2020, Mr Pocock alerts the Fedora community to the fact that blogs, including
      his own, are being censored from the Planet Fedora service.

   519.       This is significant because the Fellowship had previously elected Mr Pocock as their
      representative and Mr Pocock had sought to publish accurate reports about the ethical problems
      in the open source software environment.

   520.      Volunteers expressed frustration that the Fedora Foundations, similar to the Debian
      Social Contract, was violated by censorship. (see exhibits)

   521.     Volunteers expressed concerns that this coincides with the acquisition of various
      companies by larger corporate interests, for example, the IBM acquisition of Red Hat and the
      Microsoft acquisition of Github. (see exhibits)

   522.        27 March 2020: Chris Punches: "I had initially thought that the CoC wave across the
      F/OSS world a few years back being pushed by activist groups was to prepare larger hubs of
      activity for corporate acquisition, but, was unable to track it to a meaningful conclusion when I
      got distracted by Red Hat's acquisition by IBM, Github's acquisition by Microsoft, Docker's
      acquisition by Mirantis, NGINX's acquisition by F5, Rackspace's acquisition by Apollo, etc, etc,
      etc...."

Conspiracy against Dr Jacob Appelbaum, deception of the media exposed by Mr
Pocock
   523.         26 August 2020, Mr Pocock did a review of correspondence about the libel and
      vilification of Dr Jacob Appelbaum in 2016. Mr Pocock found the harassment rumours
      appeared to be falsified and published a blog with copies of the debian-private emails. The blog
      title is âDebian falsified harassment claims in Appelbaum expulsionâ. This enraged some of the
      people who lied about Dr Appelbaum. Some of the people like going on these crusades and
      they don't like being exposed as a bunch of liars and cyberbullies. Mr Pocock has a long history
      of sticking up for the little guy, including his defence of Michael Kappes, Dr Norbert Preining,
      Dr Jacob Appelbaum, Dr Richard Stallman and the Albanian female whistleblowers.

   524.       December 2020, Google puts pressure on the co-head of their Artificial Intelligence
      ethics department to withdraw a research paper or remove the names of other Google
      employees from the paper. There was some conflict over whether the paper is pure research or
      whether it is advocacy or a combination of research and advocacy. Timnit Gebru left her job at
      Google with some ambiguity over whether she resigned or whether Google sacked her. This
      has awkward similarities to the situations where people resign from Debian or FSFE in
      objection to something and it is reported with the negativity of an expulsion.

   525.      In December 2020, Galia Mancheva wrote a blog post about taking Matthias Kirschner
      and FSFE to court after he sacked all the women. There were two women, Galia Mancheva and
      Susan Eiswirt. Galia claims that Kirschner came around to her home to try and take back her
      laptop. She went on medical leave and she told him that he is not welcome at her home. These
      groups are cults, they believe the pursuit of their philosophy is above all traditional boundaries,
      including the personal space and personal time of the employees and volunteers.

   526.     January 2021, Dr Norbert Preining becomes the first person to be âexpelledâ from
      Debian twice. The Debianists refuse to tell anybody what crime he committed, if any.

Redox OS, death of 18 year old volunteer, reports of cyberbullying
   527.       March 2021, another death is discussed publicly. jd91mzm2 / LEGOlord208 (Samuel)
      was a Redox OS developer and participant in their Summer of Code as a teenager on three
      consecutive summers. His death in March 2021, age 18, has been discussed as a suicide. His
      real name has not been presented. Although the death is discussed widely, it hasn't been
      possible to obtain an official report of cause of death. The journal SegmentFault published a
      report claiming they confirmed his real name, date of birth, the death and links to cyberbullying.

   528.       Remember, many of the volunteers started as child prodigies.

Berlin police decline to use criminal defamation law against Nazi comparisons for

      protect the FSFE (fake FSF) from alleged Nazi comparisons after the cancellation of elections.

Petition used as vigilantism against Dr Richard Stallman
   534.        In March 2021, the OSI president, Molly de Blanc, used her former edX email address
      to start an online mob against her former employer, Dr Richard Stallman. The mob was thinly
      disguised as a petition. The title of the petition âAn open letter to remove Richard M. Stallman
      from all leadership positionsâ. It includes comments like âOur communities have no space for
      people like Richard M. Stallmanâ and âIt is time for RMS to step back from the free software,
      tech ethics, digital rights, and tech communitiesâ. In other words, they seek to create a virtual
      solitary confinement, sending Dr Stallman to virtual Siberia. They wrap these words with all
      kinds of tangential comments about diversity but this obsession with excluding people is the
      polar opposite of diversity. Moreover, it amounts to harassment and it creates an emotional
      burden for everybody who is exposed to these vigilantes.

   535.       Once again, Mr Pocock stood up against the mob and asked about Dr Stallman's civil
      rights. Molly's mob became even more ferocious seeking to censor and slander everybody who
      defended civil rights. One of the larger Linux distributions was systematically locking out
      every volunteer who mentioned civil rights of Dr Stallman. Mr Pocock has a long history of
      sticking up for the little guy, including his defence of Michael Kappes, Dr Norbert Preining, Dr
      Jacob Appelbaum, Dr Richard Stallman and the Albanian female whistleblowers.

Mr Pocock punished for starting ethics-oriented business during pandemic and

   536.       In 2020, the Ecole Polytechnique Federal Lausanne (EPFL), which has a status similar
      to the University of Melbourne, announced that Switzerland didn't have the capacity to run a
      private equivalent to services like Zoom. After that, Swiss institutions trusted the American
      companies with all their communications.

   537.     In April 2021, Mr Pocock was entitled to extensive furlough benefits during the
      pandemic but he chose to start a new company, Software Freedom Institute SA in the Canton of

       Vaud, Switzerland. Given his extensive experience in real-time communications technology, he
       hoped to help improve on the problem of private alternatives to Zoom and Teams.

   538.       During World War 2, a former student of Xavier College, Flying Officer Philip Wyatt
      Ryan, had send many letters back to his family in Australia. He was the pilot of a bomber
      LM338 PO-U that crashed in Courgent, France. Many years later, the residents of the village
      began building a museum dedicated to the allied aviators. Mr Pocock began a discussion about
      this with Xavier College and the school decided to donate an original copy of the yearbook
      from 1945, The Xaverian, containing all of Flying Officer Ryan's writing, to the museum in
      Courgent. 18 September 2021, when travel restrictions had been lifted, Mr Pocock travelled to
      Courgent to attend a ceremony and present the gift.

   539.       Mr Pocock published a blog post together with a video of the ceremony for the alumni
      community. At this point, the Debianist social media addicts had spent years creating the image
      that Mr Pocock was some kind of a Neanderthal. The image of him wearing a tie and engaging
      in a voluntary activity to honour veterans was completely at odds with the image the
      cyberbullies had been trying to superimpose on his life ever since the death of Mr Pocock's
      father.

   540.       5 October 2021 Mr Pocock published the blog âGoogle, FSFE & Child Laborâ.
      Remember, Mr Pocock had observed the problems with his own eyes in Albania. Mr Pocock's
      cousin received the choir scholarship associated with the late Cardinal Pell. Mr Pocock himself
      had been doing voluntary work since he was 14 years old and the Debianists have maliciously
      sought to undermine the recognition that would normally be given to somebody who had done a
      lifetime of voluntary work since their childhood.

   541.        In November 2021, outraged that Mr Pocock had been part of a ceremony at the war
      graves and in reprisal for his evidence about Google, the Debianists escalated these attacks by
      publishing defamation in the form of a âStatement on Daniel Pocockâ. The defamation was
      clearly intended to sabotage Mr Pocock's involvement in future events, impede Mr Pocock's
      ability to undertake his profession and to cause personal pain to Mr Pocock and his family after
      Mr Pocock had resigned from mentoring at a time of grief.

   542.      Remember, the German FSFE (fake FSF) had elected Mr Pocock on ANZAC Day, 25
      April 2017 and when they realised the significance, they had cancelled future elections and

       censored mailing lists. Mr Pocock's birthday, 9 November, was the Kristallnacht. Mr Pocock's
       father died on Hitler's birthday. Mr Pocock's great grandfather was one of the ANZACs who
       landed in France during World War One. There is no doubt the Debianists and FSFE people
       have some obsession with Mr Pocock's visits to Australian war graves in France and that is a
       big factor in the fierce acts of libel.

   543.      On 15 December 2021, Techrights editor Dr Roy Schestowitz publishes a document
      allegedly obtained from the Lakeway Police Department âOffense / incident reportâ concerning
      Graveley, Balabhadra, incident #21-01655. The police officer J Alonzo #730 reports arresting
      Mr Graveley on allegations of Assault-Strangulation. No further information is provided about
      the progress of the prosecution or the role of Mr Graveley in the open source software
      âcommunitiesâ.

   544.       Strangling girlfriends is a lot like using lawyers to censor volunteers.

   545.      The hysterical attacks against Mr Pocock and his family, which had resurfaced in
      November 2021, appear to be convenient for those seeking to distract attention from the
      genuine allegations against Mr Graveley. There are more attempts to silence Mr Pocock and Dr
      Schestowitz from talking about real perpetrators, we will get to that.

   546.       January 2022, first UDRP case opened. Mr Pocock's blog post âGoogle, FSFE & Child
      Laborâ presented as the sole evidence of âbad faithâ, which is one of the criteria required to
      seize a domain name.

   547.      January 2022, Elon Musk begins buying shares in Twitter, leading to the takeover in
      October the same year. Recall this is what Mr Pocock predicted in November 2018 in his
      statement at the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights.

   548.      On 5 February 2022, Debianist Wouter Verhelst used the FOSDEM bzw mailing list to
      broadcast more rumours about abuse, violating the privacy of Mr Pocock's family and the
      defamation remains accessible on the Internet.

   549.      In March 2022 a UDRP decision was rendered by the ADR Forum stating that Mr
      Pocock was the victim of harassment by a much larger company. The verdict quickly became
      known throughout the open source community. Anybody subsequently spreading rumours
      about Mr Pocock and his family should have realised that their conduct was also an act of
      harassment.

   550.      Immediately after that, on 21 March 2022 Mr Pocock published an Open Letter to the
      ACM regarding Codes of Conduct impersonating the Code of Ethics. No official response was
      observed at the time. ACM is one of the leading professional bodies for computer scientists.

Debianists ignore harassment judgement and start UDRP copy-cat
censorship/shaming case, Google rewards them with more money
   551.       On 20 April 2022, immediately before Debian / SPI started a copy-cat UDRP
      denunciation attack, one of the members of the trademark committee resigned. Felix Lechner
      indicates that there are differences of opinion but despite the fact Debianists claim to be
      transparent, those differences of opinion are not documented publicly:

               Please accept herewith my resignation as your trademark delegate, effective
               immediately.... With this step, I hope to make room for someone whose attitudes toward
               business and legal matters can reflect more closely the preferences of the membership
               as a whole.

   552.       28 April 2022, the Library of Congress web site publishes a guest post from Marilyn
      Creswell at the University of Michigan Law School about âThe Seizure of Jewish Intellectual
      Property Ahead of World War IIâ. It discusses the techniques Nazis used to obfuscate the
      names of Jewish co-authors in important books and, research papers and similar works that they
      didn't want to destroy. This is similar to what we see when names are maliciously removed
      from the list of Debian Developers.

   554.     10 May 2022: immediately after the UDRP denunciation libel dossier is in the WIPO
      procedure, Google confirms they will be a platinum sponsor for DebConf22 in Kosovo.

   555.      Remember, the Debianists' emails and blog syndication service were censored by
      Alexander Wirt and Joerg Jaspert at the end of 2018 and January 2019. It is revealed that the
      disputed debian.community domain name was only registered ten months after the censorship
      blockade against Mr Pocock. The debian.community domain was only registered in October
      2019. Therefore, when the disputes began at Christmas 2018, the domain and web site
      debian.community did not exist at all. From that, we can conclude that the real reason the
      dispute began in December 2018 can not be related to anything that anybody else published on
      debian.community and other web sites. The censorship at the end of 2018 is because the
      Fellowship voted for Mr Pocock in 2017 and Mr Pocock asked important ethical questions.

   556.        19 June 2022, Michael Anthony Bordlee, a respected open source virtual reality (VR)
      artist, died in New Orleans, Louisiana, age 29. He was a graduate of Christian Brothers and
      Jesuit New Orleans (2012) and worked as part of the Parallax Visions collective. One of his
      final projects was a VR simulator to help people understand depression (news report). The
      cause of death has not been disclosed.

   557.      1 July 2022, Dr Roy Schestowitz publishes a report stating that Balabhadra (Alex)
      Graveley has entered a guilty plea (US-style plea bargain) to get deferred sentence on a real
      sexual harassment / assault strangling charge. Notice how somebody who pleas guilty to real
      harassment and abuse can continue working in open source software âcommunitiesâ while fake
      harassment and abuse rumours are used to silence people who raise concerns.

   558.     July 2022, the two Albanian female whistleblowers are given a trip to GUADEC in
      Mexico. They no longer say anything about who did what in Albania.

Mr Pocock acquires Debian-related names to promote his joint authorship status
independently
   559.      Mr Pocock acquires various Debian related domain names to promote the parts of
      Debian he works on, for example, debian.finance and he also obtains domain names like
      debian.news and debian.video to promote general content from himself and other co-authors.

   560.     Mr Pocock believed he had genuine rights and legitimate interests in acquiring the
      domain names based on his status as a joint author and the precedent from the Scientologie.org
      UDRP decision D2000-0410.

   561.       The domain names are purchased from the registrar Gandi SAS. Registration fees are
      paid in advance for one or more years at a time.

   562.       On the anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2022, Axel Beckert, one of the Debian
      joint authors at ETH Zurich signs a complaint to the Swiss authorities claiming that Mr Pocock,
      who is also a joint author, has been banned from receiving recognition for his status as an
      author and ordered not to speak about health & safety issues such as the Debian suicide cluster.

   563.      It may seem odd to somebody in a United States court procedure, but there is intense
      secrecy about workplace deaths in Switzerland, to the extent that even when something
      dramatic happens, the police clear the scene and people go back to work without talking about
      it. By way of example, an 18-storey scaffolding collapsed right next to venues from the Youth
      Winter Olympics in Lausanne. News reports appeared about the collapse but there has not been
      even one news report about the inquiry after the day of the accident.

   564.       People understand that when working for a Swiss employer, it is important to protect
      secrecy. Yet the Debian Social Contract is an agreement, an authorisation and an obligation to
      be transparent. There are certain contexts in Switzerland, such as nuclear safety, where the
      internationally agreed standards of transparency override the local custom. The obligation to
      expose the risks around the Debian suicide cluster, based on the social contract, is on par with
      the obligation to prevent the disclosure of banking records, based on local law.

   565.      On that basis, those trying to advance a complaint with the Swiss authorities, to
      retrospectively superimpose Swiss laws over the Debian Social Contract for one private
      individual is an incredible act of betrayal. Mr Pocock and other co-authors are unable to take
      back the work they already contributed so why should some Swiss or German bully be able to
      take back the social contract?

   566.      Yet the two-faced betrayal just described, in violation of the first amendment, appears to
      be funded by the $120,000 âprofessional feesâ and legal fees disclosed by the US-domiciled
      s503(c) âcharitableâ non-profit Software in the Public Interest, Inc., of New York.

   567.       Remember the comments from Ana Guerrero in 2012, the German and Swiss have been
      plotting against Mr Pocock for more than a decade and they blame Mr Pocock for everything.
      They use his work without paying anything but they squeal like stuck pigs when he asks ethical
      questions. Switzerland does not have the first amendment and rich people can pay lawyers and
      judges to control what other people talk about. SPI, as an American s503(c) tax deductible non-
      profit claiming to be aligned with the first amendment has raised $120,000 from people who
      presumably believe in the philosophy and then SPI diverted the money to lawyers in a
      jurisdiction that is contrary to the first amendment.

British coroner warns about repetitive exposure to negative content from Internet
   568.       On 13 October 2022 H.M. Coroner Mr Andrew Walker sent a Prevention of future
      deaths report to various tech companies including the leading social media networks Twitter/X
      and Facebook. The report was made subsequent to the conclusion that âMolly Rose Russell
      died from an act of self-harm whilst suffering from depression and the negative effects of on-
      line contentâ. The coroner goes on to note âThe platform operated in such a way using
      algorithms as to result, in some circumstances, of binge periods of images, video clips and text
      some of which were selected and provided without Molly requesting them.â

   569.      Mr Pocock's spouse had began engaging in self harm at a similar age, 14 years. In 2018,
      the Debianists began exposing Mr Pocock to unsolicited comments about âharassmentâ,
      âabuseâ and âbehaviorâ. They have repeated these rumours through mailing lists, social media
      and search results and even in conference speeches for seven years at the time of this complaint.
      They do so through the use of algorithms and through deliberate interventions by the
      cyberbullies. The exposure to these troublesome terms, in this context, and over such an
      extended period of time is every bit as harmful as the exposure to graphic images of self-harm.

       Spreading rumours about these private issues, whether it is through a mailing list, a racist Swiss
       judge or a corrupt WIPO lawyer, is a deliberate tort and it is Intentional Infliction of Emotional
       Distress.

   570.       The exposure to these privacy violations is even more extreme because Mr Pocock has
      suffered significant financial costs relating to the illness of a family member while Google
      doesn't actually pay Mr Pocock anything at all. Remember, Google's employee Margarita
      Manterola even prohibited Mr Pocock's wife from eating at DebConf15.

   571.       In the case of Molly Russell, the coroner declared that âIt is likely that the above
      material viewed by Molly, already suffering with a depressive illness and vulnerable due to her
      age, affected her mental health in a negative way and contributed to her death in a more than
      minimal way.â. Google and their puppets began deliberately exposing Mr Pocock to these
      âabuseâ rumours at a time of grief. This is analogous to the exposure of Molly Russell during a
      period of illness.

   572.      1 November: Twitter's new owner dressed as Satan for Halloween. Halloween
      originated in Ireland. Mr Pocock, who anticipated this outcome at the UN Forum on Business
      and Human Rights in 2018, has Irish nationality.

Promoting technical integrity while mocking general notions of integrity
   573.       18 December 2022, the journal IEEE Software announced that a paper published by two
      former Debian leaders, Stefano Zacchiroli and Chris Lamb, had won their best paper award.
      The title of the paper is Reproducible Builds: Increasing the Integrity of Software Supply
      Chains. At the top of a research paper, the authors normally identify their respective employers.
      Stefano Zacchiroli has mentioned the institutions UniversitÃ© de Paris and INRIA, France. Chris
      Lamb has simply written âReproducible Buildsâ in the place where other authors would write
      the name of their employer.

   574.       Reproducible Builds is the name of the concept they are promoting rather than the name
      of an organisation. Tactics like this are obfuscating Lamb's sources of income.

   575.       During the two years Lamb served as Debian Project Leader, his personal web site
      claimed he was a freelancer and provided a list of very small projects he worked on in the past.
      The Reproducible Builds web site mentions the names of various current and previous sponsors,
      including Google. Lamb is obfuscating the extent to which he was influenced by Google during
      the time he was Debian Project Leader. It is ironic that these obfuscation tactics are perpetuated
      in a research paper promoting integrity of software supply chains.

   576.       However, it is quite a serious topic because during the time Lamb claimed to be the
      leader of Debian, he was arbitrating in disputes with external organisations, without revealing
      the extent to which he profited from his personal dealings with those organisations.

   577.      By way of example, Lamb revealed that he acted in disputes from Google against other
      co-authors of Debian, while the Reproducible Builds web site suggests that Google was a
      sponsor of his personal work at the same point in time.

   578.       If Lamb's remuneration depended on him exploiting the work of other people to meet
      the promised goals of Reproducible Builds and if he relied on deception, obfuscation and
      punishments to achieve commitments to his patrons, all while pretending to be leader on behalf
      of the Debian Developers, that is a modern slavery situation.

Mr Pocock gave witness statement to Carabinieri on day Cardinal Pell died in
Rome
   579.       On 31 December 2022 the former Pope Benedict died. Shortly afterwards, Mr Pocock
      saw fresh news reports about the late Cardinal Pell in Rome. Mr Pocock's attention was drawn
      to the evidence published by previous inquiries. He discovered that Spotlight investigators in
      Boston found correspondence from a priest in Melbourne, the priest in question was
      instrumental to the cover-up and the priest is also connected to the choir at the center of
      Cardinal Pell's prosecution. This particular aspect of the case was not explicitly stated in the
      public documentation, it only became evident based on Mr Pocock's contextual knowledge. Mr
      Pocock considered the weight of the scholarships associated with choir participation and
      recalled the manner in which the Debianists paid for the Albanian women to travel to Brazil,
      pressured them to withdraw their favourable reports about Mr Pocock and then granted an
      internship to one of the women.

   580.       While reading the report of the Royal Commission, Mr Pocock read more about the
      tactics and words chosen by abusers for keeping their victims silent and realised that these were
      very similar to the words used when people are shamed by the Debian âAnti-harassmentâ team
      and the Debian Account Managers. In both cases, the fear of shame is used to maintain silence.
      Dr Norbert Preining had published an email in December 2018 revealing that Debianist Enrico
      Zini uses these tactics. On the afternoon of 10 January 2023, Mr Pocock discussed these
      similarities with the Carabinieri and a few hours later the Cardinal died in Rome.

   581.       In more detail, what we see is that some people are simply not fit to be in a position of
      authority. The Catholic Church is struggling to recruit priests and the reports suggest they
      lowered their standards, to a very low level, where they allowed a small number of known
      paedophiles to work because it was better than no priest at all. In the exploitative world of open
      source software development, there is a similar challenge finding people with competence and
      integrity, therefore, when a role is vacant in a Code of Conduct team, it will be given to the first
      person who volunteers, regardless of competence or integrity. Some people have ended up in
      these roles by chance. Some people have deliberately sought these roles so that they can push
      their personal viewpoints on diversity or some other topic. For some of these people, the power
      gets to their head. Whether it is in one of the oldest institutions, the Catholic Church, or in high
      tech, some people think they are God and they want to ostracise anybody who tells them they
      are not. The Catholic Church created the now discredited Crimen Sollicitationis document. It
      is written in Latin but it is almost identical to the Code of Conduct gobbledygook in open
      source software, it is simply a tool for ostracising anybody who calls out real abuse (Crimen
      Sollicitationis art. 70):

              70. All these official communications shall always be made under the secret of the Holy
              Office; and, since they are of the utmost importance for the common good of the Church,
              the precept to make them is binding under pain of grave [sin].

   582.       The resignation / suicide note of Frans Pop, like many other messages on debian-private,
      finishes with this line:

              All mails I ever sent to d-private (and mails quoting them) shall remain private.

              So long,

   583.      Mr Pocock contacted Martin Pop, the brother of Frans Pop and asked him if the family
      was given a copy of the debian-private messages. Pop replied that these messages had never
      been disclosed to the family.

               Martin Pop: This is quite shocking to me. I did not know anything about this.

   584.       Some people from Debian / Ubuntu / Canonical came and took away Frans' computers
      after the funeral. The family thought these people were helping them but they were
      simultaneously removing evidence.

               Martin Pop: All of Frans computers are gone too. There was hardly any paper
               documentation in his home.

   585.      Martin Pop revealed that the convoluted structure of Debian Project and SPI had
      stymied any thoughts about how to pursue compensation. This outcome can be traced back to
      the messages from Bruce Perens in March 1998 about âthe liability issueâ.

              Martin Pop: I don't know what to say. And Debian being what it is, a project and not
              really a company, who or what is liable in a court of law?

   587.      On 17 January 2023 the SPI started a trademark dispute through a civil procedure in the
      Canton of Vaud. They used the trademark dispute to regurgitate privacy violations about
      âharassmentâ and âbehaviorâ.

   588.       On 4 April 2023 the Swiss financial regulator FINMA rendered a decision liquidating
      the Swiss legal protection insurance Parreaux, ThiÃ©baud & Partners, also trading as Justicia SA
      and Justiva SA. Mr Pocock's Swiss company had purchased insurance from Parreaux, ThiÃ©baud
      & Partners and was left empty handed. Mr Pocock subsequently discovered that the regulators
      and Geneva bar association had known about problems in the firm for at least two years. The
      liquidation of the firm was ordered during the period when the media was preoccupied with the
      Credit Suisse failure.

   589.     Moreover, the firm appointed to liquidate Parreaux, ThiÃ©baud & Partners is Walder
      Wyss. Walder Wyss is the same firm that was representing SPI against Mr Pocock in a civil
      procedure. Mr Pocock immediately felt that no reliable judgement could be achieved in the
      trademark dispute given that counsel for the adverse party had gained access to his legal insurer.
      Mr Pocock unilaterally withdrew his Swiss trademark registration.

   590.       The judges and greffiers (law clerks) attempted to ignore the irrevocable cancellation of
      the trademark and ordered the transfer of the trademark. The Swiss Intellectual Property
      Institute (IPI), equivalent of the USPTO, rebuked the judge for making an order that was
      âimpossibleâ to implement. The judge sent two further letters retracting the order.

   591.       In April 2023, GNOME adds one of the Albanian women, Anisa Kuci, to their Code of
      Conduct committee. The woman previously worked as a waitress and she has no professional
      training in law or human rights. The GNOME transparency report says that she was given the
      Otter Tech online training in âenforcingâ a Code of Conduct. Remember, Molly de Blanc
      described the Otter Tech witchcraft in her FOSDEM talk. People are encouraged to submit
      anonymous complaints. The Code of Conduct committee has a secret meeting in a secret
      channel and without speaking to anybody on either side of a dispute, they make up a verdict and
      a punishment. If in doubt, expel somebody.

   592.      September 2023, FINMA releases a highly redacted version of the decision shutting
      down the illegal legal insurance scheme Parreaux, Thiebaud & Partners. All the names and
      even the dates are redacted. The redacted report is released around the same time FINMA

       announces the resignation of the FINMA CEO. News reports cover the CEO's resignation but
       none of the news reports mention that an illegal legal insurance company operated out of
       Geneva for five years and then vanished in the blink of an eye.

   593.       On 7 October 2023, Mr Pocock published his first blog post about the illegal legal
      insurance, bad faith and the FINMA judgement against Parreaux, ThiÃ©baud & Partners. He did
      not make this research and publication spontaneously. In the Swiss procedure started by the
      Debianists on 17 January 2023, they had demanded a publication by the Swiss tribunal
      rewriting the death of Mr Pocock's father. Such a demand is obscene and the Debianists
      deserved to be tarred and feathered for spreading smears about âbehaviorâ at a time of grief. Mr
      Pocock felt compelled to demonstrate that the secret trial process, including his own legal
      representation, the bar association and the financial regulator had collectively failed to provide
      the relevant services when they were needed, throughout the entire period from when he started
      the company in Canton Vaud, when he purchased insurance, when he notified the jurists that he
      was being harassed by the Debianists, at every step, the jurists failed. To mitigate any risk that
      the Debianists and the tribunal might denounce his family, as demanded by Debianists, he felt it
      was necessary to publicly expose the Swiss corruption.

   594.       From the point where the illegal legal insurance was liquidated, Mr Pocock has been an
      unarmed civilian victim of lawfare while the non-profit Debianists, who claim to promote
      transparency, are obfuscating their sources of funding from some of the world's largest
      companies, including Google. This disparity limits the options available to Mr Pocock such
      that one of the few options available is to publish the evidence, names and all, so observers
      cross-reference the evidence and names with public sources and see that Mr Pocock, rather than
      the secretive Swiss tribunal, is the most likely source of truth.

   595.       Publishing the name of the Swiss jurists was necessary so that observers can cross-
      reference public records from the bar association, the directorships listed in the corporate
      registry and facts about their experience and credentials that they voluntarily disclosed through
      services like LinkedIn. This, in turn, demonstrated that only one of these people had passed the
      bar exam and many of them had no legal experience at all. Most of them only had experience
      in sales and some administrative work.

   596.      In other words, it was a boiler room in Geneva. One news report noted the founder had
      never passed the bar exam. Nonetheless, he had been invited on a weekly talkback radio

       program where he would answer questions from callers and promote his illegal legal insurance
       scheme.

   597.       Having been exposed to both the cover-up around the institutional abuse and the cover-
      up around JuristGate, Mr Pocock examined the cover-up tactics in some detail and found they
      are remarkably similar. During the 2008 financial crisis, there was public concern about
      revolving doors between the regulators, the banks and the credit ratings agencies. In
      Switzerland, Mr Pocock found the revolving doors had been removed, leaving the doorways
      wide open and the same people were concurrently working in the illegal legal insurance office,
      tribunals, the city council, and at least two district attorneys' offices. Exposure of what is both a
      boiler room and a massive corruption of the legal and political system is not only embarrassing
      for the individuals who participated, it is also embarrassing for all other organs of the justice
      system where the same people have worked, concurrently with their work in the boiler room. If
      these conflicts of interest were discovered in an American or an Australian courtroom then a
      miscarriage of justice would be declared and the trial would be abandoned or a verdict set aside.

   598.       1 November 2023, All Saints Day, the festival of Martyrs, Mr Pocock was granted Swiss
      citizenship. Nonetheless, the acquisition of citizenship was overshadowed and tainted by the
      overbearing behavior of the Debian Project and those behind them and the remarkable
      discoveries Mr Pocock had made about the illegal legal insurance (JuristGate).

   599.       There is enormous embarrassment in the Swiss authorities that after such an extensive
      period of time spent methodically shutting down the boiler room while everybody was
      distracted by Credit Suisse, Mr Pocock, a former UBS contractor, has picked the insurance
      scam wide open and published it almost in the same breath as taking the Swiss citizenship oath.

   600.      Trevor Kitchen, a British/Swiss citizen, discovered and disclosed the FX scandal ten
      years prior. Switzerland tried to extradite Kitchen from Portugal in 2018, just before the EU
      whistleblower protection directive came into force. The extradition request was declined,
      appealed and declined again. The tribunal in Portugal and various observers commented that
      Mr Kitchen could not be extradited for exposing a crime and even if Kitchen was extradited, he
      could not trust any lawyer or judge in Switzerland and he would not have a fair trial.

   601.       Mr Kitchen had exposed a scandal in the financial sector and this resulted in the
      perception that the Swiss judicial system would be rigged against him. Mr Pocock has exposed
      corruption in the judicial system itself, so the trademark procedure and any other Swiss
      procedure against Mr Pocock is even more likely to be biased, untrustworthy and a vehicle for
      reprisal.

   602.       Gerhard Ulrich (Swiss citizen), founder of âCall to peopleâ and the swiss-
      corruption.com web site, publishing a list of judicial errors, was pursued by the secretive Swiss
      âTIGRISâ commando unit and imprisoned for 4 years. Once again, this is another example of
      the harsh consequences for anybody who questions the credibility of the Swiss tribunals, as Mr
      Pocock did some weeks before the tribunal decided to try and make an invalid judgement.

   603.     The trademark cancellation notice was delivered to the tribunal by registered mail on 10
      November 2023, the cancellation was acknowledged by the judge Richard Oulevey on 13
      November 2023 and the date stamp on the invalid judgement is 26 November 2023. This
      sequence of events proves the judges and the greffier have knowingly stamped an invalid
      judgement.

   604.       Given that the libellous and invalidated judgement being circulated by the Debianists
      was only created several weeks after Mr Pocock dramatically put himself at odds with the Swiss
      legal profession, it is essential to consider the possibility that the tribunal deliberately made an
      invalid judgement out of reprisal, not simply out of human error, even though they knew the
      trademark was cancelled.

   605.       Between 2002 and 2004 there was a significant outcry in the Internet community about
      the actions of a Swiss magistrate demanding that ISPs sabotage the Internet to censor access to
      swiss-corruption.com. Debian and EFF and their supporters were against the censorship. One
      of the judges involved in that controversy was Daniel Hofmann in the Tribunal of Vaud.

       Ironically, the invalid judgement paid for with $120,000 of Debian money in 2023 has been
       signed by a judge Caroline Kuhnlein-Hofmann. Is the judge Daniel Hofmann her father? This
       further emphasises the fact that the money has been spent contrary to the philosophy that
       Debian's co-authors believed we were working for over more than three decades.

   606.       One of the Debian co-authors in Switzerland, a board member of the Debian.ch
      association, Didier Raboud is employed at the Swiss IT contractor Liip SA. The co-founder of
      Liip SA is Gerhard Andrey, a prominent member of the Swiss parliament. The judge who
      signed the invalid order, Caroline Kuhnlein-Hofmann is appointed by the Green party and pays
      part of her salary to the party. Records showed a payment of CHF 8,400 in 2022. The Green
      party parliamentarian Gerhard Andrey submitted a witness statement in the procedure and the
      judge did not declare her conflict of interest.

   607.      While dealing with the hassle of the Swiss jurists, Mr Pocock began researching the
      corruption, eventually publishing findings on a web site JuristGate.com and acquiring the
      previously banned domain name swiss-corruption.com

Abraham Raji (DebConf death, drowning) anticipated by Mr Pocock's research
into negligent homicide
   608.       At the same time, Mr Pocock began looking through the debian-private archives to see if
      the records could support an investigation into negligent homicide. The British call it Gross
      Negligence Manslaughter. On 9 September 2023, a dossier of approximately 100 pages, mostly
      from debian-private, was sent to the coroner who investigated two previous deaths in
      Cambridgeshire, England. The email included a comment âBased on my own experience of
      both Debian culture, the Pell situation and the evidence in these emails, I feel that there is an
      ongoing risk to the health of people who engage with this culture.â.

   609.       12 September 2023, three days after the prediction sent to the coroner's office, Abraham
      Raji died at the DebConf23 in India.

   610.      Abraham Raji was a local resident of India, the host country for DebConf23 and he had
      done a lot of unpaid work to prepare for the conference. This included the design of the
      conference logo.

   611.      On the conference day trip, people went to a beach and then a canoe / kayak expedition.
      "Energizing Day: Cherai Beach Fun and Kayaking"

   612.      Participants were asked to contribute some of their own money for the activity in the
      kayaks.

   613.       Mr Raji was left alone to swim unsupervised while other participants went in the kayaks.

   614.     A search and rescue mission failed to find Mr Raji. According to news reports,
      everybody else went back to the conference venue and locals found the body in the evening.

   615.       Remember, Mr Pocock's first voluntary activities, beginning in 1993, included the
      Southern 80 ski race and the Red Cross Murray River Canoe Marathon, where he was part of
      the WICEN amateur radio group in the water safety team. Mr Pocock had participated in
      multiple rowing clubs, he had been a member of the committee and even rowed with the police
      officer who won the National Emergency Medal. He had been dining with Arjen Kamphuis
      before Kamphuis disappeared in a canoe excursion. Mr Pocock had anticipated a health and
      safety risk in an email to the coroner just days before the death of Abraham Raji. In the twelve
      months before the drowning of Abraham Raji, stubborn people at Debian had paid $120,000 in
      legal fees to censor the one colleague they should have listened to before going out in the water.

   616.       The DebConf23 budget approval email tells us that the total budget for the conference
      was $226,500. The legal fees spent to censor Mr Pocock, the Australian volunteer elected by
      the Fellowship on ANZAC day, was over half of the budget for a fifteen day conference.

   617.      Abraham Raji's web site is still available. His first blog post âWhy Debianâ includes the
      comment âEverything in Debian is transparent, all forms of official communication are a
      matter of public record, the amount of unresolved bugs, every step taken by debian as an
      organization, everything is in the open! I appreciate that from my distribution. There is no room
      for underhand corporate deals, no unfair treatment behind private mails and everything can be
      reviewed by the public.â.

   618.       What Raji has written is the way the Debianists try to present themselves. Yet their use
      of Swiss tribunals harbouring conflicts of interest, their conduct in the FSFE Legal Network,
      eighty thousand emails hidden in debian-private archives, all shows that there are many
      opportunities for underhand behavior.

Amandine âcryptieâ Jambert reveals use of pseudonym, Conflict of Interest,
resigns
   619.     On 10 October 2023, the FSFE (fake FSF) conducted their annual general meeting at the
      Linuxhotel, Essen-Horst, Germany.

   620.       The minutes of the meeting include the resignation of Amandine âcryptieâ Jambert.

   621.       Jambert reveals she has been participating and voting under a pseudonym âcryptieâ.
      Notice that when men use a pseudonym they are accused of trolling but women are given the
      benefit of the doubt.

   622.       Jambert states that her new job at the European Data Protection Board creates a conflict
      of interest.

   623.       She does not mention that her previous job at the French data protection agency CNIL
      also created a conflict of interest.

   624.     She does not mention that the prior conflict of interest was obfuscated by her use of the
      pseudonym âcryptieâ.

   625.      Remember, in some years Google has been the biggest sponsor of the FSFE and their
      events while Jambert's previous employer, CNIL, was responsible for investigations into
      Google and in fact penalised Google with the biggest ever fine for GDPR violation in 2019.
      How could Jambert simultaneously investigate Google while being part of a pro-Google
      lobbyist like FSFE?

   626.       Because Jambert is a woman, people tell us we have to turn a blind eye to the conflict of
      interest and put her âprivacyâ first.

Nazis used administrative procedures to obfuscate identity of inconvenient authors
of technical works
   627.      January 2024, the University of Western Australia Law Review published the article
      Copyright Nazi Plunder - How the Nazis Aryanized Jewish Works (UWALawRw 3; (2024)
      51(1) volume 46) by Lior Zemer and Anat Lior. As in the blog post by Marilyn Creswell from
      2022 (Library of Congress), the authors of the paper consider the manner in which the Nazis
      wanted to gain benefit from some technical books and research documents but they didn't want
      to recognise the names of some co-authors.

   628.      The paper by Zemer and Lior tells us that the Nazis used administrative measures to
      achieve their aim of obfuscating who deserves recognition for certain intellectual works:

           Despite the fact that written IP legislation in Nazi Germany did not include specific
           exclusions for Jewish applicants and authors, in practice, they were excluded by
           administrative measures alone rather than legal ordinances.

   629.     The UDRP at WIPO, which SPI has chosen as a tool for obfuscating and denouncing Mr
      Pocock and his family, who has rights as a joint author, is an administrative procedure too.
      What a creepy similarity. Mr Pocock's birthday, 9 November, is the Kristallnacht and Mr
      Pocock is being targetted with underhanded techniques the Debianist borrowed from Hitler.

   630.      It is suspected that these techniques evolved out of the FSFE Legal Network (LN)
      mailing list, which is hosted in Berlin.

   631.      2 December 2023, a man with a machete and hammer attacks people at Pont de Bir-
      Hakeim in Paris, France. News reports make various references to terrorism and mental illness.
      Debianists have adopted the hammer as a metaphor for illegal coercive control over joint
      authors.

Debianist Cyberbullies administrative procedure SLAPPs Mr Pocock. Corruption
and LLW during WIPO process.
   633.      20 February 2024 SPI submitted a complaint containing libel about Mr Pocock and his
      family through the WIPO UDRP denunciation procedure.

   634.      The service DNSlytics finds over 2,700 domain names containing the Debian trademark.
      SPI and Debian only made WIPO complaints against 14 domain names / web sites.
      Coincidentally, those domain names are all owned by the same person, Mr Pocock, who the
      Debian cyberbullies have been vilifying with ritual defamation since the death of his father.

   635.      Between 4 March and 13 March 2024 the WIPO staff notified Mr Pocock they had
      received the libel from the Debianists.

   636.      On 7 March 2024 Mr Pocock begins the JuristGate.com web site where he analyses each
      aspect of the JuristGate affair in separate blog posts with links to evidence.

   637.      The WIPO staff member is hiding her full name and signing each message âStanislava
      I.â. WIPO seem to know they are hurting people and they do things like this to avoid
      accountability and avoid consequences for their gangsterism.

   638.       At the same time, a libel case appears in the UK's High Court, KB-2024-003529
      Balabhadra Graveley vs Roy Schestowitz of Techrights. The case is advanced by the firm Brett
      Wilson LLP. It may be nothing more than coincidence that people associated with large
      multinationals are simultaneously trying to silence all the independent technical blogs and news
      sites. This is more evidence that these groups are breaking their own promises, the Debian
      Social Contract and the first amendment are not taken seriously by some of the corporations
      who get the most benefit out of the software.

   639.      1 April 2024, Jonathan Carter sends an email to debian-devel-announce mailing list
      declaring that Mr Pocock is in trouble with the police. Remember, the police officer who used
      to row with Mr Pocock has just won Australia's National Emergency Medal.

   640.      Upon seeing the privacy violations about âharassmentâ, Mr Pocock contacted WIPO on
      13 April 2024 to ask what assistance WIPO provides to victims and witnesses to abuse who are
      sucked into these denunciation procedures:

               The insults that WIPO transmitted to me are very disturbing for me as a witness in
               relation to real cases of harassment and abuse.

               Blackmail, defamation, shame and abuse often go together.

               Please kindly advise me what assistance WIPO provides to victims and witnesses of
               abuse when you blackmail us to participate in your administrative procedures

   641.       WIPO did not provide any response about how to prevent more harm from being done in
      this case.

   642.       17 to 19 April 2024, in the middle of the period where the WIPO legal panel was
      considering the dispute over Debian-related domain names, the FSFE (fake FSF) organised the
      annual Legal & Licensing Workshop (LLW). The event was in Gothenburg, Sweden. The
      participants typically include lawyers associated with intellectual property law and the more
      significant sponsors of the cyberbullies and fake non-profits. There is a perception in the
      industry that the LLW and associated FSFE Legal Network (LN) are forums for plotting against
      the intellectual property rights of individual authors, small businesses and volunteers. The
      leaked email from Max Mehl suggests there is good reason to be concerned about LN having a
      face-to-face meeting during the time the legal panel was considering the UDRP case.

       above the signature is 3 May, the document was only relayed to Mr Pocock and made public on
       6 May 2024. The day it was signed, 3 May, is World Press Freedom Day and the UDRP
       denunciation had the effect of censoring web sites like debian.news. (A new web site, deb.news
       appeared immediately after the WIPO Debianist censorship)

   644.       The document by lawyer Blackmer is loaded with libel. It accuses Mr Pocock of bad
      faith simply for including Mr Pocock's business name in a copyright notice at the bottom of a
      web site. The opinion lawyer Blackmer writes in his role as a legal panel does not fit the
      definition of bad faith. He simply doesn't show how the trademark owner or any third party
      could have suffered any loss due to the presence of these web sites. The web sites were not
      used to ask for money and they were not used to distribute substitute products or services. They
      simply contained content based on Mr Pocock's perspective as a joint author.

   645.       The legal panel's written decision acknowledges that Mr Pocock has made significant
      technical contributions to the development of Debian GNU/Linux. Therefore, it is only logical
      to find that Mr Pocock is one of the joint authors. There is significant incompetence and
      negligence on the part of W. Scott Blackmer for failing to note in his UDRP denunciation the
      fact Mr Pocock is a joint author of Debian GNU/Linux, or in the term used by joint authors
      since 1993, a Debian Developer.

   646.       Once it is agreed that Mr Pocock is a joint author, it is only logical to conclude that Mr
      Pocock also has legitimate interests in using the trademark that is identical to the name of the
      creative work, Debian.

   647.       Once the legitimate interests are acknowledged, the UDRP does not require the legal
      panel to make any determination about bad faith. W. Scott Blackmer was negligent in ignoring
      the legitimate interests and this negligence has allowed him to stray into making the far-fetched
      accusation of bad faith.

   648.      Ordinary people like Mr Pocock pay $10 or $20 to register a domain name with no idea
      they could subsequently face staggering legal bills and UDRP denunciation on the WIPO web
      site. The gangsters behind UDRP shaming practices seem to know that a lot of people who pay
      $10 for a domain name will not be able to afford a lawyer for an appeal.

   649.      It just doesn't pass the smell test. How can somebody who has done unpaid voluntary
      work for decades be accused of bad faith for publishing information about his own unpaid
      voluntary work and the intellectual property he was encouraged to share as part of Debian
      philosophy?

   650.       Mr Pocock submitted all of these facts through the UDRP. The legal panel disparaged
      Mr Pocock's submission with a condescending comment that it was not in the form normally
      prepared by greedy WIPO lawyers. The lawyer Blackmer could see that Mr Pocock was
      participating Pro Se as a private individual and a volunteer forced into multiple acts of UDRP
      harassment. He is negligent in failing to take this into account and adapt the lawfare process for
      an ordinary human being.

   651.        The lawyer Blackmer wrongly and negligently suggested Mr Pocock's response was
      late. In fact, WIPO's case coordinator didn't specify a time zone for the deadline. The lawyer
      Blackmer appears to be in some indeterminate US time zone and Mr Pocock submitted the
      UDRP response at 23:46 on 10 April 2024 believing that was 14 minutes before the deadline in
      Blackmer's time zone. Blackmer didn't make any attempt to clarify this point before making an
      accusation of lateness, this is more of lawyer Blackmer's negligence. He was in a big rush to
      criticise and took little interest in the truth.

   652.      The cyberbullies SPI and Debian Project submitted defamatory privacy violations in
      their UDRP case and lawyer Blackmer copied-and-pasted the defamation and privacy violations
      verbatim into his opinion. Moreover, the libel was placed under the heading â4. Factual
      Backgroundâ when such accusatory nonsense would appear to belong under â5. Parties'
      Contentionsâ if it was included at all. Including the material verbatim and including it under a
      heading â4. Factual Backgroundâ demonstrates negligence, bias and a wilful intention to libel.

   653.       The domain names were registered in the personal name of Mr Pocock, reflecting the
      fact Mr Pocock has collaborated on the joint authorship of Debian since before forming his
      company. This registration strategy was chosen based on the previous UDRP decision
      concerning the scientologie.org domain name. In the scientologie.org case, the legal panel
      decided that the authorship interests derived from the rights in the Scientologie book were a
      legitimate interest and the holder of the copyright could keep the domain name, despite the
      similarity to the trademark for a well known cult. Yet the lawyer Blackmer has contrived this
      excuse to include Mr Pocock's company name in the UDRP denunciation because the company
      name was mentioned in the copyright notice. He is doing that to tarnish the name of Mr

       Pocock's company. As Mr Pocock is the sole member of the LLC, Mr Pocock is the victim of
       any negative impact on the brand, the market position and consequently the revenue of the
       LLC.

   654.       Mr Pocock has served in various representative and voluntary roles where integrity is
      important. Most notably, the community had elected Mr Pocock as their Fellowship
      representative in the FSFE elections of 2017. In that role, Mr Pocock had correctly called out
      the fact that the name FSFE is derived from the name FSF in bad faith and even more
      disturbing, a fellow who was possibly fooled by this name had left a bequest of EUR 150,000 to
      the wrong FSFE instead of the real FSF. The counter-accusations of bad faith concocted by
      lawyer W. Scott Blackmer appear to be part of the pattern of reprisals against Mr Pocock ever
      since he resigned from FSFE in disgust in 2018.

   655.      When you consider the FSFE harbours the Legal Network lawyers like W. Scott
      Blackmer, FSFE was upset that their name/bequest scandal was exposed, it looks like there was
      a motive for somebody to do a job on Mr Pocock.

   656.      When you look at the way the UDRP denunciation is biased, for example, copying libel
      verbatim from one side and using nothing from Mr Pocock's case, it adds to the perception that
      somebody was doing a job on Mr Pocock.

WIPO UDRP procedure could be improved to avoid malicious decisions being
rendered in a single step
   657.       WIPO is operating a procedure that is flawed because it asks the legal panel to
      determine three significant points in one step. This dramatically increases the burdens on each
      of the parties. Each party needs to fully document their attitude to the first question (similarity
      of domain name to trademark), the second question (legitimate interests) and the third question
      (bad faith). Findings of bad faith can be particularly harmful because they are libellous but the
      civilian victims of this lawfare may not realise this is a possible outcome. Nonetheless, it would
      appear more logical for the legal panels to issue their opinions on each question iteratively and
      then allow a cooling off period where the parties could choose to appeal the procedure or settle
      the dispute before the legal panel is asked to rule on the subsequent question.

   658.       Being more specific, the legal panel should give their opinion on UDRP rule 3(b)(ix)(2)
      legitimate interests without completing the evaluation of UDRP rule 3(b)(ix)(3) bad faith.
      Upon receiving the intermediate decision on legitimate interests, the parties would have the
      opportunity to pursue litigation or cancel the domain names or reach a settlement out of court.
      If neither party tries to appeal the decision on legitimate interests, after a delay, the legal panel
      would then evaluate the claims of bad faith.

   659.       On 6 May 2024, WIPO forwarded the UDRP denunciation to Mr Pocock and published
      the libellous UDRP denunciation on their web site. 6 May is the Holocaust Remembrance Day
      and the UDRP seizure of domain names had the effect of censoring web sites about the Debian
      suicide cluster victims.

   660.       The process of creating and publishing the UDRP denunciations has the hallmarks of a
      protection racket. The victims, like Mr Pocock, pay a small fee, maybe $10, for a domain
      name. They invest time and money building a web site and promoting it. At some point, a
      lawyer can come along and threaten to publicly denounce the victim. They can cut and paste
      rumours and smears as they please into the web site of WIPO. The victims are effectively
      blackmailed to give their own money to lawyers to try and mitigate the defamation attacks. The
      victims are prevent from spending time with their own employment and their families. In this
      particular case, the blackmailers at WIPO have including defamation about âharassmentâ,
      which is even more troubling for Mr Pocock, because of family members who may have been
      exposed to genuine harassment or abuse.

   661.       The cyberbullies who prepared and distributed this UDRP document have committed the
      torts of negligence in various ways, for failing to give Mr Pocock a proper hearing, for failing to
      recognise his status as a joint author and for making an accusation of bad faith where it was not
      justified. By selectively cutting-and-pasting the most offensive comments from the Debianists
      into a UDRP document, the cyberbullies have collectively engaged in the torts of libel, calumny
      and IIED.

   662.        Those torts were committed for the purpose of violating a contract, the Debian Social
      Contract for violating the first amendment rights of Mr Pocock and for maintaining fear in the
      rest of the community.

   663.       Given that Mr Pocock's first amendment rights had been deliberately reaffirmed by the
      Debian Social Contract and the Debian Diversity statement and Mr Pocock has made
      substantial contributions of intellectual property based on those affirmations, the violation of
      first amendment rights is even more outrageous.

   664.      One of the web sites was at the domain debian.day and published the grievances of
      Frans Pop, the volunteer who submitted his resignation/suicide note the night before the Debian
      Day.

   665.       Another censored web site was running on the domain name debian.news, a service that
      aggregated blog posts from joint authors and published them in simple time order without any
      algorithmic censorship.

Debianists' subsequent use of domain names reveals intention of procedure was for
harassment and libel, denouncing Mr Pocock
   666.       When SPI submitted their censorship demands through the UDRP, they signed a
      declaration that they were not using the UDRP for harassment. After obtaining the domain
      names, rather than publishing any new content on them, they immediately began using the
      domain names to publish content denouncing Mr Pocock and his family. This shows that some
      among the Debianists have a pathological obsession with undermining the life of Mr Pocock,
      his career, his family life, his relationships with friends and neighbours are all attacked by this
      blanket defamation. Debianists are seeking to vilify Mr Pocock and his family and raise a mob
      against them.

   667.       Publicly naming people, violating the privacy of their families and spreading rumours
      about them appears to be a key part of the Debianists' strategy. WIPO is effectively making the
      name of WIPO available to these attackers for a small price and with no adverse consequences.
      The legal panels are not juries, they are lawyers who have a sympathy for the writings of other
      lawyers. In this case, the manner in which lawyer Blackmer has copied accusations verbatim
      into the denunciation while not using any equivalent material from Mr Pocock contributes to the
      perception that lawyer Blackmer has been more than sympathetic and actually become
      complicit with the Google racket propping up the non-profit SPI.

   668.      In all the UDRP cases, not one legal panel has found Mr Pocock responsible for
      defamation. The legal panels have classified Mr Pocock's writing as âcritical commentaryâ,
      which is similar to the term âinconvenient truthâ popularised by former Vice President Al Gore.

   669.        The Debianists using the UDRP denunciation process have never tried to convene a civil
      defamation trial to discuss Mr Pocock's publications in front of a jury. The Debianists are well
      aware that judges and juries may find at least some of the critical commentary was truthful and
      in the public interest and publicly confirm that to be so. The Debianists are aware that a public
      trial by jury would create more public debate about people doing unpaid work for Google, the
      ethical questions on censored web sites and the Debian suicide cluster. Therefore, the
      Debianists prefer to slink around in the FSFE Legal Network mailing list, the LLW, the UDRP
      and secretive Swiss tribunals where there is no trial and no jury. They use these pseudo-legal
      tricks and their Code of Conduct gobbledygook to take pot shots at victims like Mr Pocock who
      has strong rights to protection under the combined umbrella of the Debian Social Contract and
      the first amendment.

   670.       The combined effect of these libellous pot shots taken at Mr Pocock through different
      procedures and gobbledygook amounts to more than libel, the combined effect of this is the
      Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.

   671.       In their own communications, they indicate they are obsessed with controlling the
      behavior of people who are not actually employees of the Debianists. Forcing the co-authors to
      behave like an employee/servant, whether it is with the menace of violence, the menace of
      public humiliation, the menace of lawyerism is modern slavery. Remember the Debianist
      Enrico Zini asking leadership candidates to name five people they would like to expel. This is
      typical of the threat hanging over the heads of the voluntary co-authors.

Deliberate dishonesty and libel during the European elections
   672.       During May 2024, Mr Pocock was contesting the European elections as an independent
      candidate. A number of candidates suffered acts of violence during the campaign,
      demonstrating the additional risks faced by those who engage in public life. Mr Pocock
      observed that people exposed to the gossip experiments on social media and in search results
      would sometimes, without any valid reason or provocation, become aggressive or apprehensive.
      This, in turn, left Mr Pocock feeling apprehensive about his own safety.

   673.      Social media and Google prompted people to ask irrelevant questions about harassment
      rumours, without realising that this violates the privacy of family members. This distraction
      from rumours and libel undermined the effort to focus on real issues in people's lives.

   674.       On 6 June 2024, Debianist Jean-Pierre Giraud placed the invalidated Swiss civil
      procedure on the Debian.org web site without explaining that it had been invalidated and
      retracted by the judge. Jean-Pierre Giraud and Debian Project & SPI are trying to pass off the
      invalidated and retracted judgement as if it was fact.

   675.        Not only do Giraud, Norwood and SPI try to pass off the invalidated judgement in bad
      faith, they go on to elaborate with statements asserting Mr Pocock âhas failed to comply with
      any of the court's ordersâ while they fully know that the Swiss judge retracted the order.

   676.       The real facts are summarised in documents such as the death certificate of Mr Pocock's
      father. That makes it clear Mr Pocock resigned from Google unpaid mentoring activities at a
      time of grief. Attempting to usurp that significant personal loss with the superstitions of
      chronically racist Swiss hill-billy lawyers is the real tort.

   677.       The Debianists knew that the procedure was invalidated by the corruption around
      regulation of the illegal legal protection scheme. They knew that the judge's order was
      invalidated by the IPI. They new that the judge retracted it too. When the Debianists knew
      these things and published the document anyway, it is akin to knowing they received a fake fifty
      dollar bill and deliberately tried to spend it in a local shop.

   678.       The timing of their fraudulent, bad faith publication on 6 June 2024 was a few hours
      before the media news moratorium for the European elections. Had any media outlet reported
      on the retracted judgement as if it was fact, there is a strong chance that Mr Pocock would not
      have been able to have the reporting corrected or issue a reply before the moratorium took
      effect at 14:00 that same day.

   679.       Mr Pocock didn't get a lot of votes in the election and feels that the distorted, libellous
      material presented in social control media and Google's search results had undermined his
      participation in public life and the voting results are evidence of the negative impact of libel.

   680.       24 June 2024, an IBM Red Hat employee died age 37. Daniel Bristot de Oliveira was a
      Brazilian, residing in Italy, where he had obtained his PhD.

   681.      Throughout his career and long relationship with Red Hat and Fedora, de Oliveira had
      given promises to friends, family, colleagues and the community at large about the open nature
      of Red Hat Linux. Some of these commitments were captured in videos available online.

   682.        Not only was de Oliveira himself tricked by the promise of open source, he may have
      felt that he had been used to trick other people who trusted him.

   683.      He died exactly 12 months after IBM Red Hat made their decision to break the compact
      with the community and restrict redistribution of the RHEL source code.

GNOME Foundation libels Sonny Piers, everybody suffers emotional distress
together
   684.      On 8 July 2024 the GNOME Foundation published a message publicly denouncing a
      former board member Sonny Piers. Sonny published a blog post explaining he had been
      removed without any reason, without any due process, based on some secret trial.

   685.      In other words, Sonny Piers was a victim of the gangsterism predicted by Mr Pocock in
      his Open Letter to the ACM. It is a good time to read the open letter again and see how it
      compares to the facts about the vendetta against Sonny Piers.

   686.      The defamatory announcement published by GNOME Foundation mentioned the Code
      of Conduct gobbledygook. Remember, one of the people on the GNOME Code of Conduct
      committee is the former waitress from Albania who did the Otter Tech witchcraft course.
      Therefore, the reports of a Code of Conduct complaint can never be taken too seriously in these
      groups.

   687.      Think about the previous point carefully. Sonny Piers has done two decades of
      voluntary authorship. The former waitress is not an author at all. She has no competence in
      copyright law and she has no competence as a software engineer. Yet the sponsors are happy

       for that woman to sit in judgement over somebody like Sonny and take away his reputation and
       his career.

   688.       The public shaming of Sonny Piers was stressful for all members of the community.
      The forum thread shows that 18,500 people viewed the defamation. This had a triggering effect
      for other bullying victims, including Mr Pocock. The GNOME Foundation board includes Erik
      Albers from the FSFE, this is the same German who had punished a volunteer in January 2018
      because the volunteer questioned funding from Google. The presence of Albers in the GNOME
      scandal emphasises the incestuous nature of these groups. The verdicts they pronounce about
      people don't arise out of any independent and objective inquiry, these defamatory verdicts and
      judgements are born out of conspiracies, rumours and pillow talk.

   689.       The triggering impact of the Sonny Piers humiliation amounts to a tort of Intentional
      Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED). It has to be emphasised that the bullyboys at the top of
      these scandals do these punishments publicly because they want the other volunteers to be kept
      on their toes. Therefore, anybody who witnesses the humiliation is stressed and the tort of IIED
      is proven beyond reasonable doubt.

   690.       12 July 2024, four days after the shaming of Sonny Piers, the GNOME Foundation
      publishes an announcement that their Executive Director, Holly Millions is leaving. They don't
      reveal if she resigned in disgust or if she was sacked.

   691.      Millions had been in the job for nine months. During this period, M. Millions would
      have come to realise that the Executive Director title is symbolic but she didn't have any real
      managerial powers. The budgets and staffing decisions appear to be made by the board.

   692.       The GNOME Foundation web site contains minutes of board meetings that have been
      held in camera and the critical sections of the minutes are suppressed.

   693.      While GNOME and other groups loudly make claims about diversity, Millions may have
      come to realise the two Albanian female whistleblowers had been given jobs at GNOME
      Foundation and these jobs had facilitated silence. Millions may have felt uncomfortable
      supervising employees if they were there under a hushing agreement funded by a corporate
      sponsor. Such a hushing agreement is even more ludicrous when the organisation is openly

       claiming to promote diversity while it is paying women to stay silent about Albanian men who
       hijacked the diversity funding gravy train.

   694.       It is not clear if Millions personally posted the libel about Sonny Piers the week before
      her resignation or if some of the staff and board members worked around her and did it of their
      own will. The Executive Director title sounds impressive but in reality, there are different
      people in these organisations who are protected by the corporate sponsors, they are not really
      managed by the Executive Director and they do as they please. M. Millions may have realised
      she had no authority over those people and maybe she wanted nothing to do with the
      defamation tactics.

   695.        At the peak of the GNOME crisis on 12 July 2024, Peter De Schrijver (p2), a Debian co-
      author, passed away in a hospital in Helsinki, Finland. This death happened at the peak of the
      Sonny Piers / Holly Millions crisis when, once again, a lot of co-authors were feeling incredibly
      shocked, undervalued and disposable. Sonny appears had spent close to 20 years collaborating
      as an unpaid volunteer, it is hard to explain how everybody else feels when he is forced into a
      disappearance, it is like he had been murdered in broad daylight. It is not clear if Peter's death
      is related to the Sonny Piers crisis or if it was pure coincidence. Finland doesn't have a public
      coroner process and no report is currently available.

Dr Roy Schestowitz of Techrights sued in UK High Court for publishing US court
documents about strangulation case
   696.       On 23 October 2024, the UK law firm Brett Wilson LLP, acting for Balabhadra (Alex)
      Graveley files a UK High Court defamation claim against Dr Roy Schestowitz for his
      publications about the arrest of Mr Graveley on strangulation charges. Graveley v Schestowitz,
      Case no. KB-2024-003529. Notice that the court documents obtained from the US courts are
      public documents and the UK web site is free to publish them and write comments about them.
      Techrights claims in a series of reports that Matthew Garrett and Microsoft are involved in the
      legal action to bring down the Techrights web site in its entirety. There is no allegation that any
      other party was involved in the assault however.

DebConf24, forgetting Abraham Raji, Debian leader confesses swimming outside
supervised hours
   697.      In July 2024, the DebConf24 is in South Korea. People start a discussion about
      swimming at a local beach. The beach is only supervised from 9am to 6pm and this conflicts
      with the hours of the conference itself. Andreas Tille, the leader of Debian, another German,
      admits swimming illegally at 7am. Remember, Abraham Raji drowned at DebConf23 the
      previous year. Mr Pocock, the volunteer who has thousands of hours experience of water safety
      at events like the Murray River Canoe Marathon, Southern 80 and rowing is censored from
      commenting on this mailing list.

   698.      Andreas Tille: âMy guess is that neither police nor other patrol was awake at 7:00 when
      Pollo and I where there on Wednesday. Or they were afraid about the rain? No idea, nice to
      know we were lucky and thanks in any case for the warning to be carefully.â

   699.     Remember when Abraham Raji died, the announcement included the words:
      âAbrahamâs contributions will not be forgottenâ

EFF, home of Blue Ribbon Campaign for free speech online, censors Mr Pocock's
message in their Let's Encrypt forum
   700.       Later in 2024, Mr Pocock created a thread in the EFF Discourse Forum about his
      relationship with former EFF Chief Computer Scientist Peter Eckersley, the steps he had taken
      to restore Dr Eckersley's web site after Dr Eckersley's death and the vast amounts of money SPI
      had spent on legal fees attacking Mr Pocock and his family. Eckersley's web site has been
      restored at https://pde.is

   701.      Dr Eckersley and Mr Pocock have known each other since their undergraduate studies at
      the University of Melbourne in the 1990s.

   702.       Dr Eckersley had used his web site to publish comments about Google, the US military
      and Artificial Intelligence. At the time of his death, many people in the industry spoke up for
      his achievements and contributed to a high-profile crowdfunding campaign to preserve Dr
      Eckersley's brain. Yet nobody except Mr Pocock made any effort to preserve Dr Eckersley's
      writing. Why?

   703.      Mr Jacob Hoffman-Andrews is a former employee of Twitter and a former employee of
      Google, now employed at non-profit EFF. Google, the former employer of Hoffman-Andrews,
      was discussed at length in Dr Eckersley's web site.

   704.       On 5 September 2024 Jacob Hoffman-Andrews censored the thread in the EFF
      Discourse forum. This was disturbing for Mr Pocock because, Dr Eckersley is deceased and
      they had known each other throughout their entire careers, more than 25 years. The censorship
      was disturbing for Mr Pocock because the EFF is associated with the Blue Ribbon Campaign
      against Internet Censorship. Many software developers have contributed significant time and
      intellectual property without payment in the belief they have been working for this common
      cause. Mr Pocock has examined the cases of volunteers who died, including cases of suicide.
      One of the first Debian Developers to die, Joel âEspyâ Klecker, had prominently supported the
      Blue Ribbon Campaign on his web site. Frans Pop, the Debian Day volunteer suicide victim,
      had resigned once before and then returned to Debianism citing the philosophical appeal. The
      disrespect for people like Mr Klecker and Mr Pop by those who reneged on the EFF's values is
      disturbing for those like Mr Pocock who have been equally generous in sharing their time, their
      skill and their intellectual property.

   705.     The EFF is violating Mr Pocock's first amendment rights while claiming to be a
      champion of the first amendment.

   706.      The censored post to the EFF forum emphasised the sum of approximately $120,000 SPI
      and Debian Project spent on legal fees after Mr Pocock's father died to obfuscate the fact of this
      tragedy and paper over it with their gobbledygook about how joint authors should demonstrate
      submissive employee-like behavior when Google is around.

   707.       Discussion about this money is particularly relevant because SPI has never accounted
      fully for revenue related to the Debian intellectual property. Joint authors have been asked to
      leave their spouses at home and share rooms at the annual DebConf. The joint authors are
      asked to volunteer their time to sell t-shirts and other merchandise at conferences. When the
      developers attended DebConf23 in India, they were asked to contribute their own money
      towards a kayak activity on the day trip. Abraham Raji, who had designed the logo and done
      substantial unpaid work organising the conference, was left alone to swim when the other joint
      authors paid the kayak fee. Raji was sucked into a drain and drowned. The DebConf continued
      without him. The fee paid for one hour with a Swiss lawyer could have paid for all the
      participants in the kayak trip and Abraham Raji would still be alive.

   708.      Therefore, there is a compelling public interest in discussing where the money comes
      from and how it is directed, especially in a group that makes such loud statements about
      freedom and transparency.

Techrights authors claim harassment by Debian co-author Matthew J . Garrett
   709.       6 September 2024 Techrights publishes the article âWhy We Are Suing Matthew J.
      Garrett for Harassment and Why It's Important to Everybody in the Communityâ. Matthew J.
      Garrett is one of the co-authors of Debian. Dr Roy Schestowitz and his wife have had to make
      multiple civil and criminal complaints about certain people.

GNOME removes American staff with public notice, secretly adds Albanian staff
   710.      October 2024, the GNOME Foundation publicly states that two American employees,
      Caroline Henriksen (Creative Director) and Melissa Wu (Director of Community Development)
      were made redundant due to a budget shortfall. A few weeks prior to this they had added the
      Albanian woman to the staff list but they did not make any public comment about her. They
      only made a public comment about the American women who were removed.

Google giving prominent positions to libel about Mr Pocock, formerly an unpaid
volunteer for Google's own Summer of Code program
   711.        As a consequence of these vigilante packs attacking Mr Pocock and his family, Google
      displays the libel and privacy violations prominently in search results. Facts about Mr Pocock's
      professional achievements, the fact he resigned from Google's own unpaid mentoring program
      at a time of grief and any attempts to post any right of reply are routinely censored from mailing
      lists, social media and missing from Google's own search results.

   712.       During the Irish General Election in November 2024, Google search results showed a
      result from the June 2024 European Elections with the heading âELIMINATEDâ, giving the
      casual reader the impression that Mr Pocock was eliminated from the November general
      election, despite the fact no general election candidates had been eliminated.

   713.     Mr Pocock observed problems during the general election campaign similar to the
      European campaign. People exposed to social media and Google would behave in ways that

       were inconsistent with the actions and efforts of Mr Pocock, sometimes involving aggression or
       apprehensive behavior on the part of people who never met Mr Pocock before.

   714.       The voting results in the general election were also dismal, once again, Mr Pocock feels
      this can be attributed to the impact of libel.

Zizian news reports prompt flashbacks for Debian victims and witnesses
   715.       When the Zizian deaths were reported, Mr Pocock recalled the violence against Ted
      Walther at DebConf6, vandalism at the home of Dr Jacob Appelbaum, the Molly de Blanc
      âpush othersâ speech, the stalking from Ariadne Conill and felt further apprehension about the
      way the Debian âAnti-Harassmentâ Team seeks to vilify independent professionals who ask
      ethical questions.

   716.      Martina Ferrari of the Debian âAnti-Harassmentâ Team, Rhonda D'Vine of the Debian
      mailing list censors and Ariadne Conill of Alpine Linux are transgender while Enrico Zini of the
      Debian Account Managers team publicly spoke about being bisexual. There are romantic and
      physical relationships linking these different teams within the organisation. When these groups
      collaborate to bring somebody down, they are not objective in any way. Instead of due process,
      they use pillow talk.

   717.       Mr Pocock feels there are strong similarities in the way a subculture of queer people
      have used their free time to take over gatekeeper roles in voluntary groups and use those
      gatekeeper roles to participate in these vendettas based on their persecution complex. Up to
      now, other professionals have been afraid to challenge the blatant and unethical conflicts-of-
      interest because of the mantras about diversity.

   718.     Mr Pocock and other victims feel great apprehension, based on what happened to Dr
      Appelbaum's home, based on the drawings of civil disorder, based on the way the Zizian group
      behaved, that if these vigilante tendencies are not constrained then they will again manifest
      themselves in physical acts of vandalism or violence.

   719.      On 9 January 2025 Mr Pocock contacted the investigations team at WIPO, raising
      concern about the UDRP procedure from 2024 and the LLW event that took place at the same

       time as the UDRP procedure. The WIPO investigations unit decided to remove Mr Pocock's
       name from their web site. It appears that the Debianists have seen the UDRP as a low-cost
       opportunity to shame unpaid volunteers by publishing their names and defamation about them.

   720.       Relationship between Google and the other cyberbullies, fake non-profits: Google
      donations and Google's employees are interacting with all the other entities. The other entities
      are all much smaller than Google. Some of the written evidence in emails suggests the smaller
      organisations received pressure from Google and made decisions based on influence from
      Google.

   721.       On 8 February 2025, Maximilian Snyder from Zizian used the phone in his jail to
      transmit a statement, reminding me of the way Debian makes statements about people. Snyder /
      Zizian assert through the statement âYou need to have a crisis of faith about whether animals
      are people. It is critical to saving the world.â When I read that, I felt that Zizian wants to
      replace the laws of man with the law of the jungle, which is on par with the Debianists trying to
      impose their Code of Conduct gobbledygook on everybody they come into contact with. This
      smells like another case of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.

Presumption of innocence compromised by administrative procedures
   722.      February 2025, Australian magazine The Monthly published a lengthy report by Louise
      Milligan under the headline "The True Legacy of the Rapist George Pell". The late Cardinal
      Pell was acquitted in the criminal procedure. Around the time he died, an administrative
      procedure, the National Redress Scheme, decided to give a payment to somebody making a
      claim about an incident unrelated to the criminal procedure.

   723.       The administrative procedure lowers the bar significantly, allowing people making an
      allegation to get a payment in situations where it may not be possible to get a criminal
      conviction. The administrative procedure is asked to make payments on the basis of a
      "reasonable likelihood" rather than the criminal standard "beyond reasonable doubt". There
      was no trial and no jury.

   724.       Statistically, when we are talking about a famous person or a whistleblower, it seems
      that claims will be presented to the administrative procedures over and over again until sooner

       or later, by random chance, it seems that one of those claims is going to be rubber stamped as a
       side effect of guesswork or a desire not to leave the claimants empty handed.

   725.      Recall IBM Red Hat brought a UDRP dispute over the WeMakeFedora.org domain
      name (ADR Forum FA2201001980642). The administrative panel confirmed that Mr Pocock
      was the victim of a witch-hunt, an abuse of the administrative procedure. People with deep
      pockets keep coming back and trying again until they find a lawyer without a conscience
      willing to smear a civilian.

   726.      It feels very uncomfortable that procedures like the National Redress Scheme and the
      WIPO UDRP can bypass the jury process, bypass the presumption of innocence and give these
      verdicts on demand, especially in the case of people who are unable to defend themselves or
      submit an appeal to a procedure that can be initiated after their death.

   727.       People of integrity may choose not to be a Catholic priest, a childcare worker or an open
      source software developer because in all of these fields, administrative procedures can now be
      used to arbitrarily denounce somebody. The result is that some high quality candidates simply
      don't enter these professions at all.

   728.       In Australia, major religions have voluntarily submitted to the National Redress Scheme
      while many smaller cults have not. This means a deceased Catholic priest could be found
      "guilty" of a crime in the National Redress Scheme while a deceased cult leader could not be
      investigated in the scheme at all.

GNOME closing bug reports, sacking Executive Directors without investigation
   729.       On 21 April 2025 Jeremy BÃ­cha from Canonical Ltd / Ubuntu went and unilaterally
      closed five of my bug reports about the GNOME desktop. This is disrespectful of the time I put
      into investigating the original issues and writing the bug reports for them. The Debian Social
      Contract (DSC), point 3 states âWe won't hide problemsâ and the full text of the DSC
      emphasises the importance of the bug reports. Closing bug reports over aggressively obfuscates
      the issues raised, it creates the impression that the overall number of bugs is lower than it really
      is and it reduces the motivation of people who spend time testing the software and writing high
      quality bug reports. The sudden manner in which BÃ­cha did this is unprofessional. It may not

Complaint filed in US federal court
   730.       6 May 2025, on the eve of the conclave, a complaint about Debian cult behaviour is
      filed in US District Court for the Southern District of New York.

   731.      Coercive control is a major theme of the complaint, along with censorship, defamation
      and harassment.

   732.       The name of Cardinal George Pell is mentioned in the complaint and the conclave
      elected the first ever American Pope Leo.

Harassment convictions at Ubisoft, cult references
   733.        In July 2025, news reports appear about the conviction and sentencing of Ubisoft
      executives for real sexual harassment and psychological harassment. Remember, in January
      2019, Sylvestre Ledru of Mozilla & Debian had written a report praising collaboration with
      Ubisoft immediately after the conviction of Cardinal George Pell, at the very same time they
      were spreading false rumours about Mr Pocock and his family. So the French court has proven
      that at least one Debianist sided with the real bad guys and people like Mr Pocock are needed
      more than ever to keep the industry honest.

   734.       A detailed and lengthy research report by FranceInfo in June 2025, written in French,
      describes coercive control and silence at Ubisoft. âClose the eyes or grit the teethâ is the title.
      One heading in the report, âUn roi tout-puissantâ translates to âAn all-powerful kingâ, so much
      like the dictators in other voluntary groups who use their CoC to silence ethical questions from
      independent experts like Mr Pocock. See the English translation.

       France. Nicolas Dandrimont and Enrico Zini lead a discussion about "Community governance
       and curation". They publish notes from the workshop, beginning with the comment "no
       names". We see it was really a meeting about coercive control and they used the word
       "hammer" seven times as they discuss ways to blackmail people instead of paying people.

   736.      17 August 2025, the day after Debian Day, Phil Wyett, a veteran of the British Army's
      Royal Engineers writes an email "Ending Debian Contribution". He states that he has been
      discriminated against and "I have tried to carry on with Debian contribution, but cannot".

   737.      It was scary to see this at 5:40am on a Sunday morning, another volunteer unable to
      sleep because of the toxic behaviour of certain people in Debian.

   738.     It was fifteen years after the suicide of Frans Pop. Pop sent his suicide note on 15
      August 2010, the night before Debian Day.

   739.      Given that cults are a form of social engineering, it is disturbing that former and
      potentially active military personnel are fooled, manipulated and exploited by the Debianism.

Facebook's former regulatory chief, Nick Clegg, on bosses pretending to be victims
   740.     23 August 2025, Nick Clegg, Facebookâs former regulatory chief, is interviewed by The
      Guardian.

   741.      Clegg states "In Silicon Valley, far from thinking theyâre lucky, they think theyâre hard
      done by, theyâre victims"

   742.       The belief in victimhood appears to confirm that harassment rumours are false.

   743.       If the rumours of harassment and abuse are false then the people who routinely spread
      those rumours are guilty of defamation and libel.

GNOME and KDE purge continues
   744.       A few days later, 29 August 2025, GNOME Foundation board publishes a blog post
      publicly sacking their Executive Director Steve Deobald. Much like his predecessor Holly
      Millions, Deobald had only been in the job four months. As a cult-like organisation, they want
      to leave a scar, so instead of simply thanking him, their blog slights him with the words:

   745.        GNOME Foundation board: "Despite these many positive achievements, Steven and the
      board have come to the conclusion that Steven is not the right fit for the Executive Director role
      at this time. We are therefore bidding Steven a fond farewell. I know that some members of the
      GNOME community will be disappointed by this decision. I can assure everyone that it wasnât
      one that we took lightly, and had to consider from different perspectives."

   746.       Mr Pocock has the perception that the corporate sponsors are not giving the Executive
      Director any real powers. When somebody is hired and they come to realise they are just there
      to be a mouthpiece, they lose motivation and they quit. The sponsors don't allow the Executive
      Director to make independent decisions about the budget or staffing. Therefore, the title
      Executive Director is only used to fool the public about the significance of this role. The role,
      which is often vacant, gives volunteers a false impression that GNOME is an independent group
      when it really feels like it is becoming a sweatshop extension of the corporate sponsors.

   747.       14 September 2025, another victim presents himself publicly. Jonathan Riddell, from
      the UK, writes about joining the development of the KDE Desktop in the year 2000 and alleges
      he has just been shafted by the joint authors of the project who abandoned their previous
      company Blue Systems and set up a new company, Techpaladin, without him.

   748.       Quoting Mr Riddell: A couple weeks later we had anther video call but Nate called me
      first and told me Iâd be excluded from it. No explanation was given beyond I had âmade some
      comments and would not be happyâ. If someone is telling you what your emotions that is when
      controlling behaviour starts to become abusive. And thus ended my 25 years with KDE.

   749.      "made some comments" - it appears that Mr Riddell feels he was punished for simply
      speaking his mind in a community born out of the promise of free speech

   750.       Mr Riddell concludes his blog post with the comments: But in the end I lost my friends,
      my colleagues, my job, my career and my family. Whatâs a spod who just tried to do the right
      thing for society to do? Dunno. For now, if you want me, you can find me surfing the endless
      wave whenever the sun sets over my digital nomad coliving paddleshack at the end of the world.

   751.       Riddell's former colleague Nate Graham has exercised a right of reply, publishing a blog
      post where he states: "KDE is thriving, with competitive board elections this year and an
      increased base of donations it can use to assert a measure of independence from commercial
      entities."

   752.       In other words, Mr Graham seems to acknowledge that all these supposedly voluntary
      non-profit organisations come under significant influence from some of the world's largest
      corporations. His comment appears to be optimistic about a future where that doesn't happen
      but his comment doesn't reveal the extent to which such influence exists today. Having "a
      measure of independence" is not the same as being independent.

   753.       Mr Riddell did 25 years of work and claims he was given the cold shoulder with no
      explanation and no severance benefit. Mr Graham asserts "Iâm confident that no laws are being
      broken here; I exhaustively researched the employment laws of 7 countries and then confirmed
      my conclusions with a lawyer before moving forward with anything.". While these
      arrangements may be technically or legally correct or there may be steep legal costs for
      anybody to challenge these arrangements, that doesn't necessarily mean the situation is morally
      or ethically acceptable.

Other observations about impact of cyberbullies' harassment of Mr Pocock and his
family
   754.      Ever since the campaign of harassment against Mr Pocock and his family, there have
      been strange incidents with a range of people, both in a social and professional context,
      including neighbours, friends, subcontractors, clients.

   755.       By way of example, a neighbour came and started shouting over the fence on a Sunday.
      It took five minutes for the neighbour to reveal the real reason he was angry was the libellous
      rumours on the Debian web site. He had been totally sucked in by it and lost countless hours
      reading it, without realising the simple fact that Mr Pocock had resigned from Google's unpaid

       mentoring at a time of grief. Both the neighbour and Mr Pocock lost time and energy for no
       real reason.

   756.       Anecdotally, some people have expressed fear that if they talk to Mr Pocock, they will
      be denounced or suffer some adverse consequences too. This is a contagious form of blackmail
      that exists within cult-like groups. Similar things happen in Scientology, people are told that if
      they can't recruit their mother they have to stop talking or âdisconnectâ their mother.

   757.      Debian and Open source software started off in the spirit of collaboration analogous to
      the academic community.

   758.       Sadly, some parts of the open source software ecosystem have descended into a racket.

LEGAL CLAIMS BASED ON THE FACTS ABOVE
Inextricably intertwined disputes
The complaint identifies multiple corporate, non-profit and individual defendants.
The copyright interest in the joint works has accumulated over a period of decades. Over that time, the
plaintiff and individual defendants have collaborated in various contexts, including joint authorship of
different works and membership of different associations. Some of these arrangements were only
short-lived, some lasted for many years. Any joint authorship rights that have arisen in any of the
software products are ongoing for seventy years beyond the death of the last author.
The allusions to first amendment free speech are closely intertwined with the collaboration agreements
between joint authors and the stated goals of the various non-profit associations.
Therefore, the disputes between authors, whether those disputes relate to joint authorship or to the first
amendment, have become inextricably intertwined over a period of decades.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 27, encompasses both the right to participate and
the right to moral recognition for works of joint authorship. The fact that both of these things are
grouped under the same article in the declaration emphasises the inextricably intertwined nature of the
dispute:

                                      Universal Declaration of Human Rights
                                             Article 27:
           1. Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy
              the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.
           2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting
              from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.

Copyright
Copyright is derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 27(2) and it is recognised
in the national laws of the countries where the joint authors reside.
In the United States, where joint authors began creating many of the related software products,
copyright is federal law.

Compilations and works of joint authorship
The software products being discussed have features of a compilation and they simultaneously have
features of joint authorship.
In a compilation, an author takes works from third parties and the author makes decisions about which
works to include (selection), how they are coordinated and how they are arranged.
The copyright in the components rests with the author(s) of each component.
The process of compiling (selection, coordinating and arranging the components) creates a work that is
distinct from any other arrangement of the same components. The person who engages in this process
is an author for the collection.
In the Debian GNU/Linux software, some of the Debian joint authors have authorship rights in
individual components and they also acquire rights for the process of arranging them in Debian. The
latter gives rise to the claim that all of those people, including the plaintiff and some of the individual
defendants, have become joint authors in Debian GNU/Linux.

Proving joint authorship under US law
To prove the regulations for joint authorship are applicable, there are multiple tests.
First of all, it must be demonstrated that the parties intended to create a work of joint authorship. In
some cases this can be hard to prove. However, in the case of open source software, the software
usually contains license statements and other governing documents asserting an intention to
collaborate. The GNU Public License (GPL), which comes in various versions, the BSD licenses, MIT
license and similar licenses all authorise other parties to modify the source code. The GPL goes further
and encourages sharing of the source code so that third parties can also modify it. These licenses
enable authors to create derivative works and engage in joint authorship. The Debian Manifesto, from
1993, states "By involving others with a wide range of abilities and backgrounds, Debian is able to be
developed in a modular fashion.", hinting at a compilation of modules created by joint authors. A
Debian constitution has been approved by a subset of authors at various times, stating "The Debian
Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating
system.". These are strong statements of the intent to create a work of joint authorship.
Secondly, it must be demonstrated that the parties claiming a right of joint authorship really did have a
creative role and make some original contribution that is typically inseparable from the work of their
colleagues.

The assertion of joint authorship has been reaffirmed by many among the defendants over the years
although they have tried to ignore it during the WIPO UDRP administrative censorship.
In October 2010, co-authors voted on General Resolution: Debian Project members. The text of the
resolution strongly affirms that a wide range of activities qualify as contributions:
"The Debian project aims at producing the best free operating system. To that end, the project benefits
from various types of contributions, including, but not limited to: package maintenance, translations,
infrastructure and website maintenance, porting, bug triaging and fixing, management activities,
communication, testing, legal advice, quality assurance, etc."
Some of those contributions, for example, free legal advice to developers, may not give rise to a joint
authorship interest. Nonetheless, collaborating in many of those activities does appear to help give
shape to the software, therefore, it is joint authorship.
Defendants publish a list of Debian contributors at https://contributors.debian.org and they publish
another list at https://nm.debian.org
Anybody named in these lists has a strong claim to joint authorship rights.
Equality of contributions: the general resolution from 2010, along with the constitution from 1998,
each proscribe a system of one person has one vote. In other words, every joint author is equal. The
fact that there is a voting system and the fact that each vote is equal gives us further confirmation that
every person entitled to vote is regarded as part of the decision making process for the selection,
coordination and arrangement of packages/modules into the compilation.
Everybody added to the Debian keyring is granted equal authority, through technical access rights, to
modify any package/module in the compilation. Many other workplaces have a more fine-grained
system of access rights but in Debian development all developers have always had equal levels of trust
to modify any package/module, including one-off adjustments to packages that were originally or
routinely maintained by one of their peers.
It is only logical to conclude that every person entitled to vote and entitled to modify the
packages/modules is regarded as an equal. As everybody is equal, everybody who has ever been
included on the Debian Developer keyring is a joint author.
The plaintiff was added to the Debian keyring in November 2012 and remained on the Debian keyring
to February 2019. For such an extensive period of collaboration, in which three major releases of
Debian occurred (Debian 7 "wheezy" 2013, Debian 8 "jessie" 2015 and Debian 9 "stretch" 2017), it is
clear the plaintiff has become a joint author.

During an administrative procedure in relation to the Swiss trademark in 2022, the defendants
submitted a bundle of documents to the Swiss Intellectual Property Institute. Included very
prominently in the bundle were the writings of the plaintiff himself. The fact that they relied on this
material in a case against the plaintiff further affirms the fact that the plaintiff is one of those who has
the status of a joint author.

WIPO panel's assertion that copyright attribution is optional
In the WIPO UDRP administrative decision, the legal panel speculates that the disputed web sites
contain a copyright notice and that as one of the parties mentioned in the copyright notice is the
plaintiff's business, the copyright notice was put there on a discretionary basis to raise awareness of the
business.
Including the full list of names in a copyright notice is not a discretionary undertaking. Anybody
publishing or reusing a work is obliged to include the names of all relevant parties in a copyright
notice.
If the plaintiff didn't have a choice about which names to include or exclude then it is not reasonable
for the defendants to claim that the plaintiff arbitrarily chose to put the name of the business in the
copyright notice.
The assertion of bad faith is offensive and defamatory. The WIPO decision didn't identify any defects
in the content published on the web sites. By using the name found in the copyright notice, where it
was no more prominent than other names, and not making any other complaint about the contents of
those web sites, they are clutching at straws.

The promise of recognition
The promise of recognition has been made in various forms and by various parties.
In typical copyright disputes, the works are generating financial income in the form of royalties and the
authors seek to distribute the financial benefits according to the law and any agreements. Financial
remuneration is not the basis of the claim here.
It has generally been made clear to contributors that they will not be remunerated financially with
royalties or wages. Therefore, the promise of recognition is the only promise and it is an important
one.
Retracting recognition is equivalent with bouncing a cheque.

Replacing recognition with assertions of bad faith is therefore worse than simply retracting the
recognition.

Implying the existence of obligations that are not in any agreement
In the WIPO UDRP dispute, the defendant SPI, has referred to a trademark policy.
The rights arising from joint authorship pre-date the trademark registration and therefore those rights
also pre-date the trademark use policy.
More significantly, a trademark use policy can grant rights to third parties but it can not extinguish
rights that have a higher precedence. The policy promoted by SPI, the trademark owner, seeks to deter
joint authors from registering domain names, in contrast with the UDRP, which permits the trademark
to be used where there is legitimate interest.
In an employment contract, the employer typically asks employees to consent to restrictions on the use
of the trademark. Third parties often have more rights to use a trademark than the employees of the
trademark owner. Yet Debian Developers are not employees and have never signed any agreements
waiving first amendment rights or legitimate interest rights.
In a situation where the trademark owner does not pay anything for our collaboration, it is important
that they should not be able to unilaterally baffle the individual co-authors about their rights under the
legitimate interest clause.

Entitlement to first amendment free speech - 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983
The updated pleading of 19 September 2025 adds one additional defendant who was already identified
in the original pleading.
Paul Tagliamonte informed us about joining the US Digital Service at the White House in October
2015 or thereabouts.
On 21 June 2016 Mr Tagliamonte joined a discussion about expelling and denouncing Dr Jacob
Appelbaum based on rumours of sexual impropriety. Mr Tagliamonte specifically encouraged the
rumours to be spread through the "press team". He did not specify why that was a wise thing to do.
Dr Appelbaum, at the time, was an American citizen living abroad. At the time of this discussion,
unidentified individuals had already defaced his home with the graffiti "rapist lives here".
The vendetta created stress for everybody and ever since then, various messages have appeared
indicating that people have apprehension about exercising their first amendment right to speech.
People specifically recall the intense negativity of Mr Tagliamonte's words about not feeling safe. He
was working in the White House and the Pentagon, how can he not be safe? After all, this was four
years before President Biden arrived with his famous dogs Major and Champ.
A US Air Force publication from 8 May 2017 gave us a picture of Mr Tagliamonte with his colleagues.
They are in the Pentagon. They are safe. Mr Tagliamonte's emails about not feeling safe have been
added in exhibits at the end. It appears that he migrated from US Digital Service to Defense Digital
Service (DDS) at some point but he remained a government employee.

Mr Tagliamonte resurfaced in 2019 spreading rumours about the mental health of the plaintiff. The
email is included in the section of the pleading about injuries.
Remember, in October 2013, the German newspaper Die Spiegel, with help from Dr Appelbaum, had
revealed the US Government NSA was spying on the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Therefore,
people have the suspicion that White House employee Paul Tagliamonte spread rumours about Dr
Appelbaum as a form of revenge or reprisal and a deterrent for anybody else who talks about
surveillance or assists the fugitive Edward Snowden.
Given the high profile of those cases involving Merkel and Appelbaum, Tagliamonte's behaviour casts
a long shadow over the Debian community and people are less willing to speak. The recent email from
Luke Faraone, the "Community Team FAQ", indicates people are still afraid to speak now.

Entitlement to first amendment free speech - influence of International bodies
WIPO is an organ of the United Nations and the US Government is a member of the United Nations.
The WIPO Arbitration center operates at the request of trademark owners who may be private or public
institutions. In this case, the WIPO Arbitration center was asked to look at disputes from a non-
government entity.
However, the rules and procedures are imposed by WIPO itself. The rules, the pressure they create
with the menace of denouncing people for "bad faith", have the effect of stifling speech.
The legal panel was constituted by lawyer W. Scott Blackmer in the United States.
WIPO has a physical presence in both New York and Geneva.
The defendant SPI is domiciled in New York.
The practice of publicly denouncing people for "bad faith" has a chilling effect on all the remaining
participants whether they are US citizens or not.
According to the web site DNSlytcis, there are over 2,700 web sites with the Debian trademark in the
name of the web site. Some of them are published in the United States or operated by US citizens. The
threat of making "bad faith" accusations is a threat to all those publishers.

Entitlement to first amendment free speech
It is understood that the first amendment does not apply in every context. For example, an employee of
a private company understands it is unwise to denounce their employer and the first amendment does
not necessarily protect them in such cases. The first amendment does not prevent privately run social
media companies from arbitrarily removing certain posts.
On the other hand, the agreements between joint authors have always included a strong emphasis on
the first amendment. For example, the Debian Social Contract, article 3, states "We will not hide
problems". All the most well known open source software collaborations have published similar
statements in the form of the Mozilla Manifesto, the Fedora Foundations and such. These statements
always refer to openness, transparency, freedom and empowering the ordinary person.
On top of these promises, the associations seek to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the public at large by
having made these claims of transparency.
They use these claims to recruit volunteers, to attract financial donations, to gain speaking
opportunities and publicity and most of all, to encourage software developers to publish source code
under royalty-free open source licenses.
When these associations denounce people, they are leaning on the reputation of the association,
pretending that the associations are faultless. Yet by violating free speech, both through censorship and
through scaring people into silence, they are distorting the facts and gaining a reputation they may not
deserve.

Methods used to undermine first amendment free speech
Once again, this is where we get to the fact that the disputes with individual defendants are inextricably
intertwined.
When one of the defendants decides to censor some fact, such as the revelation that a volunteer sent a
suicide note on the night before the Debian Day, the efforts they use are wide ranging.
To begin with, the administrators of the mailing list will remove copies of the email from the mailing
list archive that is browsable online.
The person who sent the email is then added to a blacklist preventing them from sending future email
messages to the mailing lists of the same group.
Beyond blocking messages from that person, the mailing list administrators may also block all
messages containing certain keywords.
Yet this is not enough for them. Many of the joint authors and volunteers are participating in multiple
groups with overlapping memberships. The people who originally decided to censor a topic in one
association begin a pestering campaign asking other associations to make equivalent censorship of the
victim and the forbidden topics.
Some external associations are sufficiently infiltrated that they will surrender to this influence without
asking any questions.
To propagate the censorship further, the association leading the effort seeks to denounce the victim in
various ways. To begin with, we see them making false statements about "harassment" and "abuse" as
these are invisible things that nobody can verify.
After making these false statements, they exert influence and pay money to third parties to regurgitate
the lies, for example, through lobbying journalists, paying money into the WIPO UDRP administrative
procedure or through the secretive and corrupt judicial process in Switzerland.
In parallel to this, they use various types of blackmail, which is sometimes referred to a peer pressure
but it is blackmail nonetheless.
The publicly boast about punishing and humiliating people and this public retribution, as well as being
a tactic to undermine the credibility of people who speak up, simultaneously serves to terrify anybody
else who may contemplate speaking up in future.
In the complaint, we demonstrate that various defendants have engaged in some combination of the
tactics above.

Many of the other crimes and torts described in the claim did not arise spontaneously. The offences
arise as part of this coordinated effort to undermine first amendment free speech.

Enforcing contracts between collaborators, allusions to the first amendment and
the claim against the Electronic Frontier Foundation
42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 is normally applied for civil rights / first amendment cases involving government
institutions and their officials.
None of the defendants is a government institution although it is not clear if any of the individual
defendants are currently employees of the government.
Nonetheless, the defendants, most notably those who are non-profit associations, have proclaimed a
commitment to free speech. This is widely understood to mean the associations and individuals are
consenting to be regulated by the first amendment or academic liberty to at least the same extent that it
regulates the government and public higher education institutions.
American Association of University Professors published a guide Academic Freedom and the Law.
They note that academic liberty in an employment contract would normally be disputed in state law in
the state where the employer and employee are domiciled. In this case, as we are talking about
agreements that span different institutions and private individuals in multiple states and countries and
given that it is intertwined with the dispute about joint authorship, the federal court can act on it as a
contract dispute.
These are two-way and multi-way contracts between the associations, the participants and society at
large. For example, when a member of the public visits the Debian mailing lists, they believe they are
seeing a discussion where all voices are presented.
Donors, volunteers and joint authors give money, skill and intellectual property and the entitlement to a
framework of free speech is one of the few things expected in consideration.
Specific examples of written agreements and written promises creating the contractual obligation to the
first amendment:
   1. Debian Manifesto (1993)
   2. Debian Social Contract (1997)
   3. Debian Constitution (1998)
   4. Fedora Foundations
   5. Mozilla Manifesto

   6. All promises ever made on the web sites of the associations, including debian.org, fsfe.org,
      eff.org, gnome.org
   7. All emails, blog posts, conference speeches, advertisements and similar statements ever sent by
      people in leadership positions
   8. FSFE constitution (2021 and earlier)
   9. GNU General Public License references to freedom, along with the FSF / RMS statement that
      they are about "free as in speech, not free as in beer"
Many documents also refer to the obligation indirectly. For example, the FSFE constitution refers to
the process of scientific discovery and that, in turn, implies the principle of academic liberty.
Subsequent to these contracts, many participants and observers have made statements over the years
indicating they were under the impression that the principles of the first amendment or academic liberty
are respected by these entities.
Consider the observations made in various books. These carefully edited and reviewed manuscripts
capture the participants' expectations and the public's expectation of the free software community:
Coding Freedom, The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking, E. Gabriella Coleman, Princeton University
Press 2013: "These multiyear protests worked, I argue, to stabilize a relatively nascent cultural claimâ
nearly nonexistent before the early 1990sâ that source code should be protected speech under the First
Amendment (or among non- American developers, protected under free speech laws).". First
amendment, along with the names of the defendants, mentioned many times in the book.
The Hacker Conference: A Ritual Condensation and Celebration of a Lifeworld, Gabriella Coleman,
Anthropological Quarterly, Volume 83, Number 1, Winter 2010, pp. 47-72 (Article), Published by
George Washington University Institute for Ethnographic Research: "they nevertheless share a number
of technical and ethical commitments, such as a commitment to free speech, the nature and effect of
which have been the topic of a burgeoning literature (see Kelty 2005, 2008; Nissenbaum 2004;
Galloway 2004; Wark 2004; Himanen 2001; Thomas 2002; Levy 1984; Turkle 1984; Sterling 1992;

"According to Lameter (2002) Debian was founded by an initiative of the Free Software foundation.

someone to develop a Linux distribution that would be done in the spirit of the Free Software
Movement and where all software would be available under licensing of the Free Software Foundation.
Ian Murdock responded to this ad he saw in a magazine."
The plaintiff is not the only person to believe that first amendment free speech has always been part of
the deal when collaborating in free, open source software.
Moreover, given that substantial intellectual property has been created/contributed in consideration for
the right to free speech, the contractual commitment to free speech is enduring as long as the copyright
is valid.
Joel "Espy" Klecker, the volunteer who gave his youth to Debian while dying of terminal illness,
explicitly put the EFF's Blue Ribbon Campaign logo, representing free speech, on his web site. The
web site espy.org is archived by the Wayback Machine.
Frans Pop, the volunteer who wrote his suicide note the night before Debian Day, had also written that
these philosophical objectives were key to his contributions to Debian.
Given these contractual expectations are so widely understood in society, given that these public,
collaborative software projects have been born out of these expectations and given that people have
lived and planned their deaths around these expectations, we need to demonstrate the same obsession
for ensuring free speech is not compromised.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a private non-profit entity.
The EFF operates and EFF web site at https://www.eff.org and various other projects, including the
Let's Encrypt project, with a discussion forum at https://community.letsencrypt.org
The EFF is registered as section 501(c)(3) charity receiving tax-deductible donations.
On 1 February 1996 the EFF launched the well known Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign.
The EFF has received tax-deductible, in other words, taxpayer-subsidised donations as a consequence
of their stated commitment to free speech online.
In the Blue Ribbon Campaign web pages, the EFF actively promotes the US Bill of Rights and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Therefore, this is a special case of a private entity who has recruited volunteers and donors with a
common understanding that they will be able to express themselves and they will be able to see the
unfiltered opinions of their fellow volunteers. Given the nature of the Blue Ribbon Campaign,
volunteers and donors have come to expect these organisations are subjecting themselves to the first

amendment. If EFF controlled forums are not operating freely then the volunteers and donors have
been deceived.
The content that was posted and censored by the EFF appears to be largely uncontroversial to the
public at large. It is a message telling people that Peter Eckersley's web site at https://pde.is has been
restored from a backup copy. The same post mentions the sum of money spent on legal fees in cases
where Debian censored communications by joint authors. Therefore, the dispute with EFF is not about
content pushes the limit of free speech with adult themes, libel or private personal data. The dispute is
about EFF censoring content that most people would regard as respectful and mildly political.
We are interested to know if the law suit itself will be a banned topic in the EFF's own discussion
forums.
As the censored topic in the EFF forum referenced the legal expenditure in Debian censorship and the
EFF employee who did the censoring, Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, is a former employee of Google and
Twitter/X, the cases are intertwined in subject matter and they share the common theme of voluntary
associations who invited people to work together under an agreement/manifesto/social contract that
alludes to first amendment rights for the volunteers.
The specific text the plaintiff posted to the EFF Lets Encrypt forum on 2 September 2022, which
includes hyperlinks:
               Peter Eckersley's blog is back
               Today is the anniversary of Peter's passing on 2 September 2022.
               I've written a blog (here) about how I brought back Peter's blog at pde.is and some of
               the ethical issues involved.
               Please feel free to use this thread for discussion and let people know Peter's writing is
               back.
               The amount of money some people spent to censor critical commentary about Debian,
               over $120,000 and counting, is actually four times the amount raised on GoFundMe to
               freeze Peter's brain. Go figure.

Fundamentally, each of these associations has loudly proclaimed the right to free speech, they have
used the right to free speech to solicit taxpayer-subsidised donations, they have used the right to free
speech as part of a compact between the volunteers, authors and the association and then they have
violated free speech. On a web page recruiting volunteers, the EFF claims:

Volunteers who create and contribute their intellectual property as joint authors are led to believe they
are participating in an environment where free speech is practised.
Therefore, this is as much a contractual dispute as it is a dispute about civil rights under the first
amendment.

Racketeering
18 U.S. Code Â§ 1951 refers to anybody interfering in commerce, with particular reference to extortion
(b)(2).
Joint authors have waived the right to royalties and wages in the belief that their collaboration will lead
to public and positive recognition.
The threat of sabotaging the public recognition and replacing it with public denouncements is a form of
extortion.
Multiple people have participated in creating this culture of fear and silence.
Victims have lost the opportunity to gain other forms of remuneration for their time and intellectual
property.

Conspiracy
Conspiracy, as opposed to conspiracy theory, arises when two or more people agree to work in cahoots
with each other to cause harm or loss to some third person or group of victims.
As the other acts described here have had multiple participants and as they have been pre-meditated
they meet the technical but not necessarily the legal definition of conspiracy.
In the United States federal law, conspiracy is contemplated in Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 19 for very
specific cases, including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy against an officer of the
government and thirdly, 18 U.S. Code Â§ 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence.
This latter type of conspiracy, as proscribed by US federal law, is alluded to in a general sense by the
"push others" drawing prepared by Molly de Blanc in 2019. She does not recruit a specific person to
push for her and she does not identify somebody to push. Nonetheless, the drawing presented in her
speech is a very public confirmation that this mindset exists.

       âWe can use our collective power to push othersâ. The drawing by the former OSI president
       shows us the Federal felony crime of civil disorder.

           Civil disorder (federal felony) definition: A public disturbance involving acts of violence by
           assemblages of three or more persons, which causes an immediate danger of or results in
           damage or injury to the property or person of any individual.

de Blanc and Neil McGovern, being the two most senior employees of the GNOME Foundation in
early 2021, advanced a "petition" as a form of virtual mob against Dr Richard Stallman (RMS). Based
on the previous online mobs, it was entirely foreseeable that this so-called "petition" may result in

somebody doing actual physical harm to the victim, Dr Stallman. While they didn't proscribe the form
of violence, they didn't set a deadline and they didn't offer any reward, 373 (a) is very broad and
includes any mechanisms whatsoever that "induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other
person to engage in such conduct,". For 373(a) to apply, we need to be talking about the possibility
that somebody exposed to the online lynching might commit violence or threaten violence having the
character of a felony.
The recent statistics about political violence in the United States make it clear that the country is
becoming much more polarised. Reports published after the assassination of Charlie Kirk demonstrate
that political violence is up more than twenty percent compared to the same period in 2024.
When de Blanc and McGovern published their "petition" in 2021, it would have been clear to them that
violence against Dr Stallman (RMS) was a possible outcome.
To satisfy the crime of conspiracy, it is not sufficient to say that they ignored the risk their petition
could lead to violence. We need to be sure that at the very least, they contemplated violence as an
acceptable outcome of their "petition". We can see that by looking at de Blanc's previous talks, for
example, the "push others" drawing and we can find it in the wording of the 2021 petition, "Richard M.
Stallman, frequently known as RMS, has been a dangerous force in the free software community for a
long time. He has shown himself to be misogynist, ableist, and transphobic, among other serious
accusations of impropriety.". The allegation of being transphobic is frequently used as a dog whistle
tactic to incite an angry response. It is placed in the opening paragraph.

Unauthorised and excessive credit card charges (Gandi SAS)
Prior to and during the WIPO UDRP dispute, Mr Pocock's credit card was charged for domain names
that were subsequently transferred to the defendant SPI and used to denounce Mr Pocock. The domain
names were pre-paid by Mr Pocock for a period of 12 months or longer. These pre-paid amounts have
never been refunded to Mr Pocock and these amounts are in dispute.
From the beginning of the business relationship, Mr Pocock had given Gandi authorisation to
automatically charge his credit card.
In August 2023, Gandi began charging a higher rate than authorised for domain renewals.
On 7 January 2025, Mr Pocock informed Gandi that he had detected an error in the billing and asked
them to correct it.
Mr Pocock disabled automatic payments in his account with Gandi SAS.

Gandi continued taking payments from his credit card.
Mr Pocock completely deleted the credit card from his account with Gandi SAS.
Gandi continued taking payments from his credit card.
Mr Pocock logged in to the Gandi account and found the credit card had reappeared by itself.
All the payments from the August 2023 invoice onwards are approximately double what was authorised
and the difference between the amount authorised and amount charged is in dispute.
All the payments from 20 January 2025 are completely unauthorised and the full amount of these
transactions is disputed.

WIPO UDRP appeal ignored, violation of arbitration contract terms
Under the WIPO UDRP, the losing party is entitled to appeal a decision within a certain number of
days.
The defamation and violation of family privacy is a criminal matter in the jurisdiction where Gandi
SAS is headquartered, Paris, France.
On this basis, Mr Pocock filed a criminal complaint within 10 days and provided the receipt to the
WIPO arbitration center and Gandi SAS.
Gandi SAS ignored the notice of the criminal complaint and transferred the domain names to the
defendant SPI regardless.
The defendant SPI immediately began using the domain names to denounce Mr Pocock, in violation of
their signed declaration that the WIPO UDRP was not being using to harass the respondent.

Defamation
The defendants engage in defamation and it is inextricably intertwined with undermining the positive
right to recognition that accrues under copyright law.
In the "Statement on Daniel Pocock" published 6 June 2024, the defendants claim that there was a valid
and final ruling from a tribunal in Vaud, Switzerland. They claim that the plaintiff "failed to comply".
Yet as they know the order was invalid they know the plaintiff could not comply with it or appeal it.
The judge had written a subsequent letter annulling his previous communications.

The incomplete account of the dispute published by the defendant SPI and some of the individuals
therefore creates a perception that is at odds with reality.
They wrongly imply the plaintiff liquidated his Swiss business entity to avoid payment of debts. This
is also a lie. The plaintiff has clearly indicated in his correspondence to the tribunal that after the
failings of the Swiss financial regulator, FINMA, the plaintiff had no confidence in the Swiss
procedures. The plaintiff had purchased Swiss legal fees insurance from a jurist who was subsequently
banned by the regulator. Under Swiss law, the regulator is responsible for the debts of the failed legal
fees insurance scheme.
The plaintiff was concerned that the failed Swiss legal fees insurance scheme would be unable to assist
in future disputes and for this reason, it was entirely appropriate to liquidate the Swiss entity.
They wrongly claim the plaintiff is responsible for a "heavy smear campaign", when in fact the former
leader of Debian, Chris Lamb, started the smearing himself in mid 2018 and the plaintiff is the victim
of the smearing and privacy violation.
Defendant Lamb started the heavy smearing campaign by sending defamatory emails with the subject
line "Daniel Pocock & Debian". Specifically, when defendant Lamb used the suffix "& Debian" in the
email subject line, defendant Lamb has used the reputation of the Debian software, of which the
plaintiff is a co-author, to smear the plaintiff.
Lamb started the smearing at a time of deep personal pain for the plaintiff's family. This was a time
when the plaintiff lost two family members. Lamb unilaterally denounced the plaintiff for absence
from an unpaid voluntary activity and then incited others to join him in denouncing and insulting the
plaintiff.
The plaintiff, rather than "smearing", simply raised the alarm about previous suicides that occurred due
to the overbearing demands of the group, including the death of Adrian von Bidder-Senn on the
plaintiff's wedding day.
As the plaintiff has been provoked to publish information about the excesses of the group, it is wrong
and defamatory to characterise the plaintiff as the source of the conflict.
As the defendants have committed to the Debian Social Contract, article 3, "we will not hide
problems", the defendants can not accuse the plaintiff of a "heavy smearing campaign" simply for
publishing "critical commentary". Yet they paid the WIPO lawyer to write just that.

18 U.S. Code Â§ 2261A - Stalking and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
(IIED)
18 U.S. Code Â§ 2261A - Stalking article (2) is Federal law concerned with stalking and harassment,
including electronic and online forums of stalking and harassment.
IIED is New York state law. In this case, IIED is used as part of the tactics to impose upon federal
law / constitutional free speech rights. In particular, IIED is used both to punish people who spoke up
and to deter other people from speaking up.
The public rumours about bad faith or wrongdoing, which were constructed around a time of grief,
when the plaintiff lost two family members, are a particular example of psychological harassment on
the web sites of defendant WIPO, defendant Debian and in the search results of defendant Google.
For the purposes of 18 U.S. Code Â§ 2261A - Stalking (2)(A) and (2)(B), which both concern stalking
online, we can refer to the way the defendants WIPO and W. Scott Blackmer published rumours of
harassment and bad faith on the web site of WIPO. The defendants Debian, SPI, Jean-Paul Giraud
have published similar rumours on the web site of Debian and using email sent to Debian newsletter
subscribers. The references to the plaintiff were placed on the main page of www.debian.org and the
name of the plaintiff was placed in the subject line of the emails. This has caused unreasonable
emotional distress to the plaintiff himself, as proscribed in 2261A (2)(B).
Furthermore, the placement of the defamation and insults incites and inspires third party vigilantism.
Even if the attacks on the plaintiff do not explicitly call for violence, it is easy to see similar cases in
the same community, including the attacks on Ted Walther at DebConf6 and the vandalism at the home
of Dr Jacob Appelbaum. Naturally, each new victim of this toxic Debian behaviour, including the
plaintiff, will recall the previous incidents of violence and have great apprehension about their family,
friends, neighbours and the risk to their own person.
The plaintiff is acutely aware of the case of Radio Szczecin in Poland. Radio Szczecin is a state
controlled public broadcaster. Under influence from the government, the station made a broadcast
about a paedophile in an opposition political party. The victim was the 15-year old son of another
politician. The court had made strict secrecy orders about the case to ensure the privacy of the victim.
The radio broadcast violated the orders, the public were able to identify the victim and the victim
subsequently committed suicide. When the plaintiff sees the defendants spreading ambiguous rumours
about harassment and abuse, which began immediately after the conviction of Cardinal George Pell, he
feels these rumours are an attack on the privacy of a family member who had received the scholarship
to participate in the choir. It was the most high profile abuse trial in Australia at the time. The
Debianists set off unfounded social media rumours about abuse within days of the conviction.

When the Debianists and other defendants attacked Dr Jacob Appelbaum in 2016, many emails were
exchanged on the debian-private mailing list revealing the defendants are aware they have the power to
destroy people's lives. Having seen these strategies discussed, we can be sure that the defendants have
always been aware of the harm their smearing campaign can cause to the plaintiff and it has been their
intent from the moment the rumour-mongering began.

Bad Faith
The court can make findings of bad faith based on both state and federal law and rules of procedure.
What does "bad faith" mean?
The Lawyer X Royal Commission cost taxpayers over $100 million. That is what taxpayers paid to the
lawyers to talk about a lawyer. Law Firm X was documented by an unpaid volunteer on the
JuristGate.com web site. When caviar is consumed at a lawyer's picnic, has the word picnic been used
in bad faith to give the impression of a family-budget-compatible dining experience?
In terms of domain name disputes, we typically use the term bad faith for somebody who is a total
stranger or imposter. It is not reasonable to use this term for somebody who has a genuine right of joint
authorship, especially when authorship was undertaken without remuneration by unpaid volunteers.
When talking about the material published on a web site with a disputed domain name, the public
expect action to be taken when the content itself is harmful or universally illegal. It is not reasonable to
use this term for people publishing critical commentary.
Critical commentary is simply a synonym for inconvenient truth. Al Gore's well known documentary
named An Inconvenient Truth has taken close to $50 million at the box office. Inconvenient truth is a
form of truth, therefore, critical commentary can not be bad faith.
The Debian Social Contract, article (3) "we won't hide problems" is an agreement, authorisation and
invitation to publish critical commentary about the technical and ethical issues in the distribution of
open source software. A WIPO UDRP legal panel, W. Scott Blackmer, has specifically written on 3
May 2024, World Press Freedom Day, that web sites were "used for critical commentary".
The Debian Open Logo License states that the Debian swirl logo, a registered trademark, can be used
without authorisation yet the use of the logo is disputed in the WIPO UDRP complaint. Therefore, as
there was a pre-existing open license for everybody to use the logo, making complaints about use of the
logo is itself bad faith.

Copyright law gives all joint authors a right to recognition at all times. Copyright can not be
extinguished by allusions of expulsion. In private emails exerting coercive control over the plaintiff,
the defendants use the term "demoted" yet in the complaint to the WIPO UDRP, the defendant SPI
claims that the plaintiff's authorship rights have been extinguished by expulsion. Being demoted and
being expelled are not the same thing. The references to expulsion are a form of brainwashing to
subvert the strength of the joint authorship relationship. Suggesting that any joint author can be
"demoted" or "expelled" is therefore bad faith because it leaves the joint authors feeling unsure of their
real rights under copyright law.
The fact they attempted this "demotion" trick on multiple people, including Santa, Daniel Baumann,
the plaintiff and Dr Norbert Preining, suggests it is an ongoing pattern of bad faith. If a joint author
rejects the status of being less equal, if a joint author rejects being a slave, the defendants can
retrospectively claim the victim was really expelled. Yet analysis of the communications between the
defendants and the victims always shows an intention for the victims to continue collaborating on the
software. The slithery manner in which the defendants pivot between claiming to demote people and
claiming that people have been expelled is surely bad faith.
Then we have the question of whether Debian is a professional activity or a hobby. Many open source
software activities pivot between having meetings on weekdays or on weekends. For example, the
DebConf annual conference is typically held over eight or nine days, taking in two weekends and five
week days. It is held in the northern summer, typically July or August. Some participants are using
their paid vacation days to attend the conference while other people count the days as paid working
days. Employees of some companies, especially those in Europe, are entitled to count the weekend
days as overtime hours and take extra days of vacation in lieu. Debian and some other software
initiatives have become unpaid jobs disguised as hobbies. Yet the feeling victims get when some
stranger says "Code of Conduct" is identical to the feeling one gets when you are at the pub on a
Sunday evening and your boss shows up in the same pub. Persistently and deliberately pretending
work is a hobby is bad faith.
The defendants publish various documents and statements about diversity overflowing with mantras to
the effect that "everybody is welcome". Yet they keep a list of people who are banned/censored on the
whim of the somebody's girlfriend and what makes her "feel safe". The promise of diversity is bad
faith.
Some truths are more inconvenient than others. It isn't fair to randomly speculate about who is dating
who in a voluntary organisation or a hobby like Debian. Extreme rumours about relationships were
spread by leadership figures in late 2018. Victims of the rumours, in defending their honour, have a
right to expose conflicts of interest in the leadership and ask who really had a relationship. These

questions were not raised spontaneously. These questions were not raised as a matter of reprisal. The
questions about the real relationships are raised to demonstrate conflicts of interest and to highlight
unequal distribution of bursaries. In these contexts, there is no sexism or bad faith.
The term Debian Developer can refer to somebody in at least three different ways. Firstly, as a joint
author, secondly, as an expert skilled in Debian technical work and thirdly, as somebody who chose to
be a member of one of the optional associations. The first definition, joint authors referring to
themselves as Debian Developers was in common use from 1993 while the trademark and the first
unincorporated association only appeared in 1998/1999. A real joint author using the term Debian
Developer in the original sense is not bad faith. The WIPO legal panel was negligent in ignoring this
argument.
In fact, the WIPO legal panel has deliberately cut and pasted a whole bunch of this disputed
gobbledygook into their decision while not cut and pasting any of the arguments rebutting it. The
reader may be deceived to feel the plaintiff had not responded at all.
The WIPO web site claims "Arbitration is a confidential procedure" yet the defendants appear to be
using the procedure to deliberately and publicly denounce the plaintiff by hanging out the dirty laundry
on the WIPO web site. Is WIPO's claim of confidentiality bad faith?
In United States law, the term bad faith is typically used for insurance disputes. Ironically, in this
particular case, the plaintiff's legal fees insurer was subject to enforcement action and then liquidated
by Walder Wyss, the same law firm representing the rival party in the Swiss civil procedure. The
failure to assist the plaintiff was bad faith while handing the dossiers of insurance clients to a rival law
firm goes far beyond bad faith. It is the Swiss JuristGate scandal.
The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE, which is not the FSF) has been told to stop claiming an
affinity to the real FSF. On their web site, they presented a button and a form for volunteers to "Join"
the FSFE. People who fill in the form were asked to make an annual payment, given an fsfe.org email
address, given an FSFE smart card and invited to vote in the annual fellowship election. Over 1,500
people completed this "Join" process but the FSFE claims they were not members. Only approximately
25 people were kept on the official membership register of the association. Ninety-nine percent of the
people who "Join" the FSFE are never invited to the annual general meeting (AGM). The allusion to
FSF-affiliation and the allusion to membership are both used in bad faith to get volunteer time and
donations, subverting the real FSF in Boston, a genuine 501(c)(3) charity.
In the European Union, the regulation on email signatures requires people to identify their employer
name in each work-related email. Employees of Google, Ubuntu and other companies regularly
collaborate in Debian mailing lists using private gmail.com email addresses. They don't include any

details about their employer affiliation in their email signature or the email address. Given that at least
some of these people are obliged by law to have a corporate email signature, this practice amounts to
bad faith.
In the history of the dispute, we looked at the way each of these situations arises. Taken together, it
paints a picture of bad faith by the defendants.
Back to the question of how we define bad faith. There can be no bigger example of bad faith than
using the term bad faith itself in bad faith, especially when the term bad faith is being used against the
backdrop of one of the most extreme cases of abuse in religious institutions.

Human trafficking and modern slavery
In the US and abroad, regulations to prevent exploitation are evolving.
The State Department published a very broad definition of modern slavery, asserting that the use of
deception to procure and exploit somebody's work is just as bad as the use of force.
We have considered patterns of censorship and a pattern of bad faith behaviour. Taken together, we can
see that authors/developers/volunteers may be fooled about who really benefits from their work.
The US Federal Acquisition Regulation includes an Anti-Human Trafficking Rule. These are strict
provisions against fees incurred by potential employees during the recruitment process. The rule
prohibits, among other things, the use of unpaid labour by people hoping to be selected for a job and it
prohibits potential employees paying their own visa fees.
It has become standard practice for US employers and companies in their supply chains to operate
recruitment programs through the open source software communities. A typical example of this is the
presence of job fairs with on-the-spot interviews at technical conferences like DebConf. The
employers try to create the impression that Debian and DebConf are independent organisations and the
participants continue to be asked to pay visa fees and some other expenses.
When the plaintiff applied for employment at a lab in the EPFL, one of the two well known Swiss
polytechnic universities, the professors asked him to do a test in his own time. The plaintiff realised it
was about a week's work and it was a task that had already been discussed publicly in the open source
software communities. Defendant Google has been a funder of work in this particular lab, therefore, it
is part of their supply chain and subject to the US Federal Acquisition Regulation. The plaintiff
reported the request for unpaid work to a Swiss legal insurer and the insurer agreed to pay for the work
in an out-of-court settlement rather than commencing a procedure that would be embarrassing for the
Swiss polytechnic institution.

The more insidious example of modern slavery is the "demotions" experiment, which has been
imposed upon Santa, Daniel Baumann, the plaintiff and Dr Norbert Preining. The victims are told that
their key has been removed from the Debian keyring but no public explanation is given. The
gangmasters can retrospectively decide how to explain the removal of the key. For example, some
months later, the gangmasters could tell the public that the key was removed due to wrongdoing. By
removing the key without any valid reason, the gangmasters can hold their victim in a state of
suspense. The victims of these tricks have received written directions attempting to coerce their work
to focus on the needs of third parties. In the first case, Santa, he expressed displeasure with the slavery
status and after about six months of Santa demonstrating he resented the blackmail, messages were
secretly distributed denouncing him and telling people not to talk to him at all. In the second case,
Daniel Baumann, he was held in the state of suspense from 2014 to 2018, a period of approximately
four years. Throughout this period, Herr Baumann lived with the constant apprehension that the
gangmasters could retrospectively create a public statement denouncing him if he wasn't submissive
enough. The third victim was the plaintiff in September 2018. The plaintiff, in turn, observed when
the gangmasters attempted the same tricks on Dr Preining in December 2018.
This trick creates a relationship where people are working under the threat of being publicly
denounced. From time to time, the gangmasters really do publicly denounce somebody to show off
their powers, as was the case with the false harassment accusations against Dr Jacob Appelbaum.
On 19 March 2025, the recent email from Luke Faraone on behalf of the Debian Community Team
(CT) demonstrates that the feeling of apprehension in the community is alive and well and the state of
fear is well understood by the gangmasters:
       âThere may be some misconceptions as to what the CT means when it writes to someone... We
       don't want people to feel intimidated that any interaction they have with CT is just a stone's-
       throw away from an adverse decision by DAMâ
It is important to remember that defendant Google has made payments to defendant Debian / SPI
coinciding with these "demotions" experiments in coercive control.
The vital evidence in these "demotions" are the emails explaining that the victims had to keep working.
If somebody was really expelled, the notion of them continuing to work together would not exist. Real
joint authorship, as in copyright law, implies equality between the authors. The word "demotion"
implies a master/slave relationship has been created but in this case there is no salary. Unpaid work,
under a framework of shaming, with the threat of public disclosure, is exploitation and violates various
criminal codes on coercive control, modern slavery and anti-trafficking.

As the federal anti-trafficking rule law applies to supply chains, there is an expectation that suppliers
abroad will adhere to local labour laws. For example, the UK Minimum Wage Act is not only applied
to employees with a written contract. The UK Minimum Wage Act is applicable to volunteers in
certain situations. For example, if Debian volunteers are being used to test new software, as in the
infamous case of systemd, they are doing work equivalent to paid software testers.
A specific example of this displayed in public is the complaint of Phil Wyett in the UK. He did a lot of
work collaborating with people on the creation of packages over many years between 2017 and 2025.
He followed the procedure to have his name added to the list of Debian Developers. Yet his application
remained stalled. He observed the names of other joint authors were added to the list within ten days
but he was waiting over a year. Eventually he lost all his motivation and energy. When Mr Wyett
began contributing, he believed this would eventually result in recognition and having his name on the
list of Debian Developers.

Antitrust behaviour (Google, Ubuntu, but also exercised through the non-profit
front groups)
The Code of Conduct gaslighting described in the claim and plaintiff's web site is an example of anti-
competitive behaviour.
Victims of the Code of Conduct are slighted for "behaviour" that doesn't resemble the behaviour of
employees.
But wait a minute - the volunteers are not paid. They are not employees at all. Some of them are
employed by other organisations.
Follow the money: Google employees enter into a voluntary group like Debian or FSFE, they make
donations to the group, they pay travel expenses and then they attack people from smaller companies.
The plaintiff founded a new company in the middle of a pandemic and he was attacked. After the
puppet organisations like Debian or FSFE attack somebody, the controlling corporations, like Google,
circulate the defamation in their search results. Therefore, Google resources enabled the conflict at the
beginning and Google search results report the conflict at the end.
The overall cycle of money, defamation and coercive control is an example of anti-competitive
behaviour.
Smaller companies, such as the plaintiff's attempt to establish a consultancy at Software Freedom
Institute, are prevented from entering the market and the smaller companies are deterred from trading
with each other.
Employees are treated as if they are "sacked" by companies that never employed them in the first place.
People have asked the plaintiff if he was "sacked" by Google. He was never employed by Google.
This undermines the employment market for those who have been denounced and it undermines the
market for employers seeking people with strong ethical practice.
Plaintiff posed ethical questions about Facebook and Twitter when attending the UN Forum on
Business and Human Rights in November 2018 (video).
The European Union has already identified in the Digital Services Act that these companies have an
excessive market power and they have been subject to special regulation when they are classified as
Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) and Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs). This is a big
hint that they are ripe for antitrust regulation.

We can see the behaviour is collusive because the employees of these companies are parroting the same
lines about Code of Conduct gaslighting or they are all in lock-step about being woke or not being
woke or whatever is the issue of the day.
There are lots of minor examples of collusion, for example, the Debian-private discussion about using
internal contacts at the hosting company OVH to seize the domain name debian-multimedia.org
The overzealous nature of the WIPO UDRP decisions making "bad faith" rulings for domain names
that have not even been used yet suggests the legal panels are under significant pressure or influence to
stifle critical commentary. The FSFE Legal & Licensing Workshop, where some of these lawyers
gather to plot against the volunteers, took place during April 2024, right in the middle of the period
when the legal panel of W. Scott Blackmer was supposedly considering the Debian dispute.
Looking at the FSFE finances, we see they obtain sixty percent of their funds from the controlling
corporations. Many of the other associations don't even give us a breakdown of how much money and
staff time they receive from the controlling corporations. Nonetheless, if it is over fifty percent and if it
is hidden then it serves to hide the fact that these non-profit organisations have become extensions of
the corporations. That, in turn, conceals the prospects for genuine volunteers and smaller companies
who try to operate within the open source software market.
The manner in which certain types of corporation attempt to control the culture of supposedly
independent voluntary groups, the use of pseudo-legal diversity frameworks, the training in
enforcement tactics, for example, the enforcer courses from Otter Tech, are an attempt to coerce and
straightjacket people. The fact that multiple corporations have coordinated around these practices and
tried to impose them globally has a smell of antitrust collusion.
While the non-profit associations are not as financially influential as the controlling corporations,
looking at their behaviour is like looking at lab samples of corruption growing in a Petri dish. For
example, when the plaintiff established Software Freedom Institute in April 2021, in the height of a
pandemic, multiple non-profit associations created statements denouncing the plaintiff and the Institute.
Each of the associations created links to statements from the other associations. Therefore, the
associations are not really independent from each other, they are in collusion with each other to prevent
new entrants from earning an income or sharing their ideas in the open source ecosystem.

Summary of the legal claims
Debian GNU/Linux is a compilation that is produced by a process of joint authorship.

The founding documents of the various associations and their promises of freedom and transparency
imply that the first amendment is applicable to the participants in free, open source software
development.

The first amendment applies to all volunteers, whether they are joint authors or not. In other words,
people who do mentoring, training, publicity, testing, administrative work, support work and similar
tasks, without payment, are not claimed to be joint authors but the first amendment does apply to them
too when they participate alongside the joint authors in these unpaid, voluntary undertakings.

The Code of Conduct gaslighting contradicts the first amendment, therefore, it is being applied
excessively.

The Code of Conduct gaslighting can not be applied retrospectively to people who had gained the
status of joint authors prior to the Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct gaslighting can not be applied retrospectively to people who had gained the
status of volunteers with first amendment protection prior to the Code of Conduct.

The civil procedure commenced by defendant SPI in the Canton of Vaud was compromised when the
legal fees insurer for the plaintiff's company became subject to liquidation by Walder Wyss, the same
law firm acting against the plaintiff's company on behalf of defendant SPI.

Furthermore, as the trademark was cancelled and the cancellation received by the Swiss Intellectual
Property Institute (IPI) before any judgement was attempted, there were no grounds for making a
judgement. Swiss civil procedure specifically states that a judgement can not be made if the object of
the judgement no longer exists, as in the case of a trademark that has already been cancelled.

As the Swiss judges were notified of the legal fees insurance scandal, they were notified of the role of
Walder Wyss in the scandal and they were notified of the trademark cancellation and as the IPI
eventually rejected their judgement, the judges' attempt to push ahead with making an invalid
judgement against an unpaid volunteer who resigned at a time of grief was not only errant, it was
tyrannical.

The defendants' attempts to promote the invalidated judgement, while knowing full well that it was
invalidated, is both a libel and a deception.

WIPO UDRP administrative decisions have previously stated that a copyright interest can take priority
over the rights of a trademark registration, giving an author or a joint author what the procedure calls
legitimate interest in using the trademark.

The plaintiff's submission to the UDRP administrative procedure included a strong claim of joint
authorship and the administrative panel did not discuss or refute these joint authorship rights at all in
their response. Therefore, the administrative panel has been negligent.

As the panel has not responded to the plaintiff's evidence of joint authorship, the defendants do not
appear to be overtly denying that the plaintiff has rights as a joint author.

There appear to be hundreds, maybe thousands of unpaid volunteers who have gained the rights of joint
authors in the Debian GNU/Linux software and other related open source software. It may be tedious
to make a definitive list of everybody who has acquired joint authorship rights.

Nonetheless, based on each of these intermediate findings, it is important to find that the plaintiff is
actually one of the joint authors.

The WIPO UDRP administrative procedure only applies the test for bad faith in the case where
legitimate interests did not exist. Therefore, if the administrative panel had examined the claim of joint
authorship, if the panel had not been negligent in ignoring joint authorship, they would not have
applied the test for bad faith at all.

Nonetheless, the assertion that publishing "critical commentary" amounts to bad faith may be valid for
trademarks in a general sense, but the restriction on "critical commentary" can not be applied to
participants in a group that encourage their participants to speak freely with the claim "we will not hide
problems". Therefore, in this context, the administrative panel's observation about "critical
commentary" displayed in proximity to the trademark does not justify a finding of "bad faith".

The second attempt by the administrative panel to assert bad faith is based on the inclusion of a
business name in a copyright notice. As it is essential for copyright notices to be complete, the plaintiff
did not have discretion in this matter and it is not appropriate to allege bad faith on this ground either.

Moreover, the original and amended complaints submitted to WIPO's procedure do not raise any
concern about the presence of a company name in the copyright notice at the bottom of the disputed
web sites. Therefore, the plaintiff had no opportunity to consider whether the copyright notice should
be amended or submit a response to the allegation. The allegation of using a business name in the
copyright notice was only introduced by the legal panel after the deadline for the response had passed.
The administrative panel should not rule on matters that the respondents in the procedures never had
the opportunity to respond to in the first place.

The WIPO legal panel went as far as ruling bad faith for domain names that had not yet been used to
publish web sites, in this case, the domain names were not used to publish critical commentary and
they were not displaying the disputed copyright notice. The panel has written "it is difficult to conceive
a legitimate, non-infringing use for those disputed domain names, and the Respondent has not
demonstrated one", effectively making an allegation that the domain names will be used for bad faith in
the future and so the plaintiff should be punished in advance just in case. Once again, with the words
"has not demonstrated one", the panel totally ignored the evidence about joint authorship, without
explaining why it is not taken into account and the panel rushed into the accusations of bad faith for
each of the domain names that had not been used at all.

In context, Debian is a voluntary activity, an activity often undertaken in free time and weekends and
without remuneration. The web sites operated by the plaintiff did not ask people for money and they
did not direct visitors to install substitute software or anything else that may be harmful. In the
circumstances, when talking about voluntary activities, the legal panel has been unreasonably harsh in
nitpicking about the smallest technicalities, failing to give the plaintiff any opportunity to adapt the web
sites, summarily taking all the domain names and publicly spreading rumours of bad faith. The
summary punishment meted out by the legal panel was extraordinarily disproportionate to the
voluntary hobbyist context and to the content of the web sites.

As legitimate interest exists and as both of the grounds for bad faith are unfounded, the overall finding
of bad faith should not have been reached.

As the finding of bad faith should not have been reached, the domains should not have been transferred
to the defendant SPI.

The defendant SPI, in their complaint to WIPO, had signed a statement that they would not use the
procedure for harassment. Nonetheless, they explicitly admit that they started discriminating against
the plaintiff in 2018, a period when he lost two family members. After obtaining the domain names,
they used them exclusively for publishing accusations that any family would find offensive at a time of
grief. Therefore, the defendant SPI has violated their declaration that they were not using the UDRP
for harassment.

Given the scandal was born under the shadow of an institutional abuse prosecution, given that the
paedophile closest to the highly discussed choir was a priest and given that the priest is named Father
Daniel, as in the name of the plaintiff, the rumours of "bad faith" are an extreme violation of privacy
and an extraordinary insult to the plaintiff's family, far beyond the evil of mere libel.

Various defendants have given the public a promise of transparency and they have given the plaintiff
the impression of rights under the first amendment. By censoring the contributions of the plaintiff and

other people, they have not only violated the rights of the plaintiff, they have violated their promise to
the public at large.

The defendants' internal procedures for dispute resolution and grievances, whereby they use secret
victims, secret evidence and secret trials without even telling the person that such a procedure is under
way, the victims only receive a punishment at the end, amount to a gross violation of natural justice.

The violation of natural justice is so significant that the accusations and punishments amount to
(cyber)bullying on the part of the defendants.

By deliberately denouncing the plaintiff to other people and organisations at a time of grief, the
defendants have knowingly intended to undermine the ability of the plaintiff to work and earn an
income.

The defendants alternate between asserting that they are "just a group of friends" who can arbitrary
leave somebody out of their birthday party to claims that they are some supreme moral authority
weaponising their high profile web site and trademark to exclude people from society at large.

By disseminating references to harassment, abuse and problems with behaviour, the defendants are
violating the privacy of harassment victims, abuse victims and those parties who really have been
diagnosed with behaviour disorders.

Beyond violating privacy, the defendants' conduct vilifies certain people and incites discrimination and
retribution.

The overall conduct of the defendants amounts to a violation of article 27 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, which promises everybody the right to participation and the right to recognition.

The public discrimination and vilification of specific critics is not only an attack on the plaintiff and
other named individuals, it constitutes intimidation of the rest of the community to remain silent about
blackmail tactics and the conflicts of interest.

An undertaking of joint authorship does not come with any default confidentiality agreement. The
publication of the debian-private messages has been discussed many times by the joint authors.
Discussions in the community have regularly raised the point that the existence of the debian-private
mailing list archive, containing more than 70,000 messages in 2018, contradicts the promise of the
Debian Social Contract, where article 3 states "we will not hide problems". In the case of disputes that
are raised in public, anybody subject to rumours of wrongdoing clearly has a right to publish any
material to help demonstrate the lack of integrity on the part of those who regularly spread rumours. It

is important to state that the plaintiff and anybody else, whether they are subject to rumours or not, is
not violating any law or contract when they publish or discuss the contents of these mailing lists.

The Fellowship had elected the plaintiff as their representative. Given the FSFE promises of
transparency and democracy, the fellows had a reasonable expectation that the plaintiff would provide
them with critical commentary about the free software ecosystem and the plaintiff legitimately felt an
obligation to fulfil that expectation through his exemplary publications of critical commentary.

The FSF (Boston s501(c)(3) non-profit) had expressed written concerns that the FSFE (Germans) is
using the name of the real FSF without authorisation and in bad faith. Therefore, the plaintiff's role, as
elected Fellowship representative, required him to bring such a serious concern to the attention of
fellows, volunteers and donors. The definition of the Fellowship representative does not include any
confidentiality provisions. Therefore, it is important to confirm that the plaintiff, in his capacity as the
elected Fellowship representative, was not breaching any alleged confidentiality agreements when he
was reporting concerns about the very name of the FSFE to the fellows, volunteers and donors.

The individual defendants and non-profit associations named in the complaint have indicated they
received extensive donations, sponsorships, use of staff time, subsidised use of Google services,
employment opportunities, travel and publicity from Google at various times throughout the history of
these disputes. When intimidating people, censoring people and publicly denouncing people, from
time to time, they have indicated that they are acting upon actual "complaints from Google". In other
situations, the enforcers have indicated they have concern about any "behaviour" that could undermine
the "reputation" of the group with Google, suggesting the resources from Google have created an
expectation that people have to be coerced into the behaviour of actual Google employees, whether
salaried or not. The cumulative effect of this phenomena is to conclude that the non-profit associations
and individuals are not really independent of Google, they are operating as an extension of Google's
will and therefore Google has responsibility for the negative impact on the plaintiff and other victims.

The individual defendants and non-profit associations named in the complaint have indicated they
received extensive donations, sponsorships, use of staff time, free use of Launchpad services,
employment opportunities, travel and publicity from Ubuntu at various times throughout the history of
these disputes. When intimidating people, censoring people and publicly denouncing people, from
time to time, they have indicated that they are acting upon wishes of management at Canonical Group
Ltd, the company behind Ubuntu. In other situations, the enforcers have indicated they have concern
about any "behaviour" that could undermine the "reputation" of the group with Ubuntu, suggesting the
resources from Ubuntu and employment obligations have created an expectation that people have to be
coerced into the behaviour of actual Ubuntu employees, whether salaried or not. Mark Shuttleworth,
the founder and CEO of Canonical/Ubuntu, has been a personal participant in the debian-private
mailing list since the beginnings in the 1990s. Frans Pop, the Debian Day volunteer suicide victim, had
indicated the comment "We are not Ubuntu's slave even if they try hard to make it look like that"

resonated with him. The cumulative effect of this phenomena is to conclude that the non-profit
associations, especially Debian, and individuals are not really independent of Ubuntu, they are
operating as an extension of Ubuntu's will and therefore Ubuntu has responsibility for the negative
impact on the plaintiff and other victims.

Looking at the financial statements of the non-profits, the general pattern we see is that donations from
the corporations are provided for specific projects or objectives. The level of donations goes up and
down substantially from one year to the next. Without the donations from a few very specific
corporations, the non-profit associations would have no funds at all. The significant absence of other
revenue sources and the absence of investments further supports the conclusion that the non-profit
associations act as an extension of the will of certain corporations.

In the case of the GNOME Foundation, which employs an Executive Director and a few other staff, the
last two people hired in the Executive Director role were both removed by the board after a period of
only a few months in the job. This further reinforces the perception that board members, under the
influence of certain corporations, are seeking an Executive Director who acts as an extension of the
donor corporations rather than somebody who builds a stand-alone, independent and credible non-
profit association. In the KDE software, which is analogous to GNOME, a developer has just
announced that after twenty five years of collaboration, his colleagues suddenly cut him out and
stopped speaking to him due to a perception he "made some comments and would not be happy".
Almost at the same time, another Debian Developer, the British Army veteran Phil Wyett, wrote
publicly that he no longer has the will to contribute after being told he will never be a real developer.
These other cases, including both employees and volunteers, lead us to the finding that the plaintiff's
case is not unique, the plaintiff is one of many people who have been bullied and discriminated against
for reasons that relate to politics and not due to any genuine wrongdoing.

The defendants, unlike many other proprietary organisations, have made grand promises of freedom
and transparency and these promises are used as a tool to recruit volunteers, donations and other
benefits. Given that these promises of transparency are so fundamental to the purported philosophy of
these organisations, they can not censor somebody without a very extreme reason to do so.
Maintaining the illusion that the organisations are free and transparent appears to be a motive for them
to create extremely negative rumours as they did to the plaintiff and other victims over the years. It is
important to declare the defamation is conducted with this particular motive.

The Fellowship had elected the plaintiff as their representative and he has proven that people contacted
him about genuine cases of harassment and abuse, making him a witness to those incidents. The
defendants' campaign to denounce the plaintiff and intimidate other people from speaking up was
intended to prevent more people making reports to their elected representative.

As the plaintiff had documented the risks to specific children in the open source software supply chain,
as the plaintiff's wife had started cutting herself at fourteen years of age, as the plaintiff's cousin had
been in the choir during the era of Cardinal George Pell and as the defendants began creating allusions
of sexual impropriety immediately after the late Cardinal's conviction, the defendants' head-strong
obsession with imposing public humiliation on the plaintiff at that moment violates privacy around
actual victims and witnesses to child abuse.

The critical commentary published by the plaintiff pales into insignificance in comparison to the
hideous violations of privacy referred to above. The public has widespread revulsion for harassment
and abuse, especially when children are involved, therefore, it is essential for the plaintiff to
demonstrate the lack of integrity on the part of those who have systematically conspired to create
allusions of impropriety involving multiple defamation victims, the plaintiff included, over many years.

One of the plaintiff's interns, Elena Gjevukaj of Kosovo, was subject to rumours of a relationship with
the plaintiff, who was her mentor in Google Summer of Code. It is vital to have a legal finding that not
only were these rumours wrong but they were also deeply offensive and absurd, given that the intern
had her wedding in the middle of the internship in the European summer of 2018.

The death of co-author Adrian von Bidder-Senn on the plaintiff's wedding day would be disturbing for
anybody. It is a disturbing fact to recall on your wedding anniversary. The defendants' seeking to
effectively snuff out the plaintiff in order to distance themselves from the death only compounds the
trauma of the death in question.

INJURIES

The defendants Debian Project, Paul Tagliamonte and Hideki Yamane have appointed themselves as
doctors and written a diagnosis of psychological injury, or is it just more libel? Nonetheless, if the
defendants are so confident in their ability to practice medicine that they distribute these messages to
millions of people who access the Debian web site every day then we can accept it as useful for the
purposes of determining liability and calculating damages. If the defendants insist they have injured
the plaintiff, if they insist that he does not have the work capacity to do the duties he performed before
the death of his father then their accusations/admissions of causing psychological harm, which they
have made without any duress, could be more relevant than any other medical evidence.

               Hi,

               First, if there's a culture problem in the project or not, sending messages
               to people they do not want to receive is not good. Of course you have your
               opinion, but your such behavior is not acceptable at any communities including
               outside of Debian. Please stop it.

               Before talking, you should get counseling for a while since it seems that
               you have some cognitive troubles now. You'd be better to hear about your
               opinion and current your mind status from professional 3rd parties, not Debian.
               (If they say you're very healthy and good, then that's good. Don't you think so?)

               Without that, we cannot make a constructive conversation.
               As I said in my platform, "Be calm, stay cool, stay safe" - Hope you stay "cool"
               a bit with help from professionals, and you would to be able to a "contributor"
               to floss again.

               Life is short - to waste our time for fighting. Let's make more values for users.

IV. RELIEF
The transgender defendant Ariadne Conill who persistently spreads rumours about a young Google
Summer of Code (GSoC) intern from Kosovo having a relationship with the plaintiff, having left these
rumours on social media and chat forums. As the rumours were spread after the intern's wedding, it is
libel, harassment and IIED at the same time. Conill to pay $10 million to the female intern and $10
million to a fund for Kosovan women, nominated by the plaintiff, being a total of $20 million to
Kosovan women and $1 to the plaintiff himself.

The defendant Gandi charged registration fees in advance for domain names that were stolen and
censored by the defendants. Gandi overcharged for other domain names in the period from 2023 to
2025 and after the plaintiff removed his credit card from Gandi's web site, the credit card re-appeared
by itself and unauthorised charges were taken from the plaintiff's card in the first four months of 2025.
Gandi can reimburse the plaintiff for the above amounts, rounded up to the sum of $5,000.

Order Defendants Gandi, SPI and Debian Project to effect the transfer of the domain names from the
WIPO UDRP dispute back to the plaintiff.

The defendant Paul Tagliamonte, as a government employee, being in one of the most secure facilities
in the world, the White House, spread rumours he did not "feel comfortable" or "safe". He did this as a
reprisal against Dr Jacob Appelbaum's first amendment rights and he subsequently attacked the
plaintiff. Tagliamonte simply needs to explain what would be more safe than the White House, without
reference to ex-President Biden's dogs, and pay $1 to each of Dr Appelbaum and the plaintiff.

   1. retract and de-publish the UDRP administrative decisions concerning Debian disputes
   2. revise all decisions published on their web site to anonymise the names of any parties who have
        been mentioned as respondent or in any other context in a decision
   3. revise the UDRP rules so that
        1. the names of respondents and any other identifying details in a complaint or response are

        2. the administrative process can be suspended more easily by external action, for example, a
            harassment complaint against the complainant,
        3. a complainant who has previously been found guilty of abuse of the procedure or any
            complainant who could be a proxy for such a complainant should be restricted from stalking
            the same respondent again,
        4. rather than examining the three tests in 3(b)(ix) in a single pass,
            1. the first test for trademark similarity (3(b)(ix)(1)) is decided and notified to the parties,
                with an appeal period and,
            2. the test for legitimate interests (3(b)(ix)(2)) is decided and notified to the parties, with
                another appeal period
            3. in the case of minor defects in a web site, rather than giving an immediate finding of bad
                faith, the panel gives the respondent a further period of 30 days to correct defects
            4. and only after the parties have had a chance to reflect on and possibly appeal each of the
                above, the panel would begin to make a decision on bad faith (3(b)(ix)(3))
   4. recognise any findings the court makes about joint authorship and copyright in Debian
        GNU/Linux,
   5. recognise that the Debian open use logo has been available for many years and people using the
        open use logo can't be accused of bad faith in the absence of other substantial reasons,
   6. apologise for being negligent in their failure to suspend proceedings on receipt of a police
        complaint, their failure to handle a written complaint about privacy of those in proximity to real
        abuse, their failure to consider evidence about the open license for the logo and their failure to

influence and direction from Google was proven in written communications from other defendants.
Google has made financial donations and donations of staff time over many years, to the extent that
Debian is becoming an unpaid extension of their businesses. Given the overall relationships between
this behaviour in groups funded by Google, including Debian, FSFE, FOSDEM, GNOME and others, it
entered into the domain of antitrust concerns. The suicide cluster, including a death on the plaintiff's

      ranking links to the plaintiff's web site, his business and related web sites, especially where his
      publishing contains first amendment protected speech about ethical issues in Google's own
      business practices and supply chain.

Defendant Ubuntu has made financial donations and donations of staff time over many years, to the
extent that Debian is becoming an unpaid extension of their businesses. Given the overall relationships
between this behaviour in groups funded by Ubuntu, including Debian, FSFE, FOSDEM, GNOME and
others, it entered into the domain of antitrust concerns. Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu founder, personally
engaged in discussion about the suicides and the next death occurred on the plaintiff's wedding day.
The suicide cluster, including a death on the plaintiff's wedding day, occurred in this context of pressure
and anticompetitive behaviour.
    5. Ubuntu to pay a sum of $15 billion to the plaintiff.
    6. Ubuntu to pay any legal costs and court costs that are not due to other defendants
    7. stop censoring plaintiff's blog from Planet Ubuntu

      and archives, replacing them with a link to the apology and call for people not to discriminate
      against any colleagues who have been attacked in the past,
   3. In consideration of the manner in which FOSDEM allowed another speaker to insult the
      plaintiff, FOSDEM conference organisers invite the plaintiff as a keynote speaker for the next
      edition of FOSDEM, in a similar time slot, venue and format as the other keynote speakers

    3. distribute the apology based on the attached text

The defendant Debian Project (unincorporated association) who has failed to protect its own members,
the joint authors, from outside influences, denounced the plaintiff and exercised coercive influence on
the plaintiff to
    1. pay $1 billion to the plaintiff,
    2. ârebaseâ the Debian keyring repository and Debian Planet repository to remove offensive
        modifications that incited discrimination and vilification of the plaintiff and other victims,
    3. cease demanding that joint authors retrospectively comply with agreements such as the flawed
        Code of Conduct, in other words, the Code of Conduct is not binding upon any joint author who
        did not affirm support for the general resolution.
    4. equal division of funds between joint authors, including restitution of expenditures that have
        already been made without consent.

The defendants Donald Norwood, Sam Hartman, Joerg Jaspert, Jonathan Wiltshire, Enrico Zini, Chris
Lamb, Jonathan Carter, Andreas Tille, Jean-Pierre Giraud, Wouter Verhelst, Kurt Roeckx who used the
Debian mailing lists, web site and trademark to denounce the plaintiff at a time of grief. Their conduct

          religious institutions and $1 to the plaintiff

       Boston, along with interest at 5% up to the date of judgement. The sum was equivalent to
       $170,000 in August 2016 and it is $266,000 today with interest compounded daily at 5%,
   2. to offer all Fellows a full refund of the membership/fellowship fees paid by those who thought
       the FSFE was part of the FSF,
   3. for those Fellows who do not demand a refund, to ensure their names and contact details are
       correctly recorded on the membership roll of the incorporated association, ensuring they receive
       notices of meetings, voting rights and financial reports in compliance with applicable corporate
       law,

   6. to stop using the name FSFE within 6 months unless they obtain authorisation from the real
      FSF and Dr Richard Stallman

For all of the defendants operating mailing lists and discussion forums, (Debian, FSFE, FOSDEM vzw,

   1. immediately cease censoring/banning/moderating those participants who were censored for
        political reasons,

All defendants who have published defamation or violated the privacy of individual, private volunteers
and families are to replace the defamation with an apology. At a minimum, the apology should contain
the names and statements provided in this example:

              Apology to the families of Daniel Pocock, Adrian von Bidder-Senn, Frans Pop, Dr
              Jacob Appelbaum, Dr Norbert Preining & Elena Gjevukaj

              Prior to and after the death of Frans Pop, fellow developers and the controlling
              corporations failed to provide adequate support to unpaid voluntary developers.

              We are saddened that the subsequent death, Adrian von Bidder-Senn, occurred within a
              year of Frans' suicide and on the wedding day of another respected Debian Developer,
              Daniel Pocock. Given the circumstances of the death, we acknowledge that few things
              would make a more unpleasant memory on each wedding anniversary.

              In 2016, communications platforms operated by the Debian Project were used to subvert
              privacy rights under German law and spread defamation about Dr Jacob Appelbaum, a
              resident of Berlin.

              In 2017, Mr Pocock used private channels to raise legitimate concerns about coercive
              control of women and exploitation of underage volunteers, both male and female, in the
              Albanian voluntary group Open Labs. Mr Pocock provided compelling evidence that
              money intended for diversity was enabling coercive control in a developing country.
              Fellow volunteers and the controlling corporations failed to provide Mr Pocock with
              any procedure to exit this situation amicably and failed to provide support to volunteers
              exposed to these situations.

              In 2018, Mr Pocock resigned from voluntary mentoring activities at a time of personal
              tragedy. Colleagues developed an obsession with having a reason for Mr Pocock's
              resignation. The behaviour of online groups in these situations, enabled by remote

              working and the social media set, fails to respect the right of every colleague to the
              privacy of their family life.

              Mr Pocock reached out to the former Debian Project Leader Chris Lamb who neglected
              the opportunity to meet Mr Pocock. This was a missed opportunity to avoid further
              conflict for the community and end-users.

              At Christmas 2018, Mr Pocock realised that a colleague, Dr Norbert Preining, was also
              being subject to coercive control. Mr Pocock reached out to support Dr Preining in
              good faith. In February 2019, Mr Pocock was subject to further reprisals as a
              consequence of supporting his colleague.

              We recognise that the attacks on Mr Pocock and Dr Preining violated the privacy of
              family life and violated a holiday season that is important for many families.

              We recognise that the wrongful and totally untrue rumours about a relationship in
              Google Summer of Code violated the family life of the intern, Elena Gjevukaj, who
              celebrated her marriage during the summer of the internship. As her real wedding
              occurred during the time of the wrongly rumoured mentor/intern relationship, the
              rumours were rude in the extreme. This has created a situation where a second couple,
              Elena and her husband, have had the memory of their wedding day tainted by the toxic
              culture of Debian group behaviour.

              We recognise that all of these people have made substantial contributions of their time
              and skill over many decades as unpaid volunteers. When disputes appeared, Debian
              leadership figures didn't take the time to even let these men tell their side of the story.
              That was wrong.

              We acknowledge that working in a large group inevitably results in situations where
              everybody will not agree with each other and the people who ask ethical questions or
              express a dissenting opinion should not be slapped down with harsh reprisals from a
              leadership figure.

              Asking an inconvenient question is not harassment. It is not abuse. It is not a problem
              with behaviour. It is our duty.

              We acknowledge that in many of these disputes, leadership figures have had commercial
              and romantic conflicts of interest that impaired their judgement.

              We acknowledge that all Debian Developers have a status of joint authorship under
              copyright law and this status entitles all Debian Developers to equal recognition of their
              status that does not expire until 70 years after the death of the last author. We
              acknowledge that this recognition can't be revoked through any statement, decision or
              vote.

              Opinions expressed freely by any individual joint author do not necessarily represent the
              majority. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that in a relationship of joint authorship, any
              author may express dissent or express their personal opinions at any time now or in the
              future, while simultaneously asserting their status as a joint author of Debian.

              We acknowledge that every joint author has a legitimate interest in using the Debian
              trademark to achieve recognition for their work. We acknowledge that some joint
              authors have gained substantial financial benefits from their association with Debian
              and no other joint author should be prevented from taking credit for their Debian
              authorship in a commercial context.

              We wholeheartedly apologise for rumours, accusations, SLAPP lawsuits and acts of
              discrimination against these valued colleagues. All rumours and previous statements
              imposing upon these colleagues and their families should be disregarded and, where
              they have appeared in public, be replaced with a copy of this apology.

The damages charged to each defendant are made up of the following:

Special Damages, Presumed Damages, Actual Damages in relation to lost income from the time the
vendettas started on 20 September 2018 up to anticipated retirement date, lost value of business share
capital.

Special Damages, Presumed Damages, Actual Damages in relation to work performed and intellectual
property contributed and created together since 1997 on the basis of positive recognition in lieu of
payment.

Punitive damages, based on the extent to which the persistent violation of privacy over such an
extended period of time impacts professional and private life, the intrusion at a time of grief, the
motives of the organisations violating agreements and avoiding payment for work and weighted based
on the relative size of the organisations responsible.

I've been a computer hack for going on 14 years and I've been active on the
net for the past 6 or so, yet I continue to forget a very basic fact...

People simply do not act the same over email as they do on the phone or
in person.

At least twice in the last two weeks I have ended up in real-time
conversations with someone I had been fighting with over email
and I instantly regretted some of the things I had said.

I can be a stubborn SOB sometimes and I fight for what I beleive in. On
the other hand, I like to think I can be reasoned with and can admit when
I'm wrong.

Well, I was wrong, and I appologise.
("I was wrrrrr.... wrrrrrr.... wrrrrrng." for "Happy Days" fans).

All of the people in this project are trying to do what they think is best
and do it in their free time. They do not deserve my attacks. They
deserve my praise and my respect.

We're all on the same side and we're all adults. I'd ask everyone to
think about what has happened and what has been said over the past few
months. Would you do/say those things if you were sitting across the
table from your adversary? I certainly didn't when I found myself on
the telephone with them.

I think the best thing for this project would be for everybody to sit

have some problems, but we can work them out if we work together instead
against one another.

The past is the past. Let's work on the future.

For those of you that do not IRC....

06:42 *Espy* is saying 'goodbye' on IRC today, spread the word
06:42 <woot> Espy: oh?
06:44 <woot> Espy: would you elaborate on that?
06:46 <Espy> terminal illness     close to death
06:46 <Joy> Espy: you're kidding, right?
06:47 <Espy> uh, no
06:47 <woot> Espy: what brought this on?
06:48 <Joy> Espy: omg!
06:50 <woot> Espy: have you known about this long?
06:53 <Espy> I've had this disease my entire life
06:55 <Espy> been bedridden at least as long as I've been a developer
06:57 <Espy> Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
07:02 <Espy> http://mdausa.org/disease/dmd.html

Espy is Joel Klecker, our long time devoted glibc maintainer. A few days
ago he joined IRC and told us he was giving up his packages to deal with
this very important juncture in his life. He has unsub'd from all lists
but -private, and one other.

Our thoughts and best wishes should go out to him. It might sound corny to
some, but since Joel has dedicated so much time to Debian, even though he
has also had to deal with this condition, I think we should dedicate our
next release to him.

Fine, then let's also express sympathy for people on the other side. Palestinean police officers killed or
injured in attacks on police buildings, Columbian cocoa farmers who are getting royally screwed by the
US government intervention (if they are to stop producing cocoa they should be protected from attack
by the drug barons), Iraqi civilians who suffer from lack of food and medical treatment due to ongoing
US bombing raids against their country, etc.

I oppose expressing sympathy for only one side in a conflict, I believe that would have to be considered
a political act.

What I didn't mention is that it would probably involve me bribing her to
deal with it; she doesn't find Debian to be quite worthwhile enough on its
own merits (she likes it, she just likes FreeBSD better, and has little
enough time to spare overall that short of someone making it worth giving
up what else she does, it isn't worth it).

This would be the primary reason she isn't already a DD, since the only
part of NM that would pose any issue at all is the wait (I can sign her
trivially, and passing the requirements is a no-brainer). But we don't
really need another developer not doing much most of the time, and I
have better uses of the money than paying her to work on it. :)

An NYT editorial wouldn't say that. But a mention in a newspaper might mention that in the Debian
project pictures of lesbians kissing are distributed as entertainment, and if a message such as yours was
public the fact that "homosexual" is used as a term of abuse might get mentioned too.

Incidentally I don't recall seeing the term "racist homosexual" used before. Probably because there
appears to be a strong correlation between racism and homophobia.

One thing to consider is that journalists often write articles with conclusions that aren't entirely
supported by the facts which are references. The next time an article in a tabloid referrs to Linux users
as "crunchies" and barracks for SCO it may be related to something like this.

Well, in short: I'm against Debian paying *anyone* (through
SPI/ffis/whatever) for work, how defined or "important" that work may
be. If that gets true it's time for me to resign.

s/psychiatrist/therapist/ Maybe someone that is experienced in large voluntary communities could
give a talk, or workshop, or both.

It would be interesting to know wether anyone knows a person that could
help us this way. I could talk to some people if the idea doesn't look
stupid to the rest you the people reading this.

When I did the NM process, I knew that I had to give some personal information
so that my AM knew me better. I also knew that these mails will be read by FD
and DAM. But I knew they will not be public even between other DD.
 So, I wrote some things about my personal life. I also wrote opinion on other
DD (my AM ask me to react to some public claim from theses DD).
 I do not want that these mails become public (even between DD and even more
external people) because I do not remember what I wrote exactly, I do not want
to check/rewrite/filter public/private parts, ... These mails have never be
intended to be read by people other than the ones that already read them.

 In summary, I'm very disappointed with the way to propose to manage very
private data of actual DD and even more non DD (ie people rejected by the NM
process)

  Vincent

Dear Developers,

delegations:

   1. Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org> is appointed FTP-master.

   2. Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org> is made a full Debian Account

   accounts according to the New Maintainer procedure.

  These delegations are effective until revoked by the DPL or by a

Quite so: learning about what non-debian stuff people do helps to make
some interesting connections.

Is it actually written that moon.d.n is acting against 'abusers'?
Using debian.net to insult other DDs is implicitly banned by DMUP.

I don't much care if some DDs want to run a public aggregator that
misses cool people like Evan Prodromu and Eddy Petrisor out because
they're too lame to edit their own blogroll (especially when it still
sends me traffic), but if they're insulting them, that's a bit off.

BTW, its name is "moon" but it says "pluto" on the page. However the
dwarf planet controversy ends up, Pluto seems unlikely to be a moon.
Is it a joke or is moon.d.n's owner stupid?

Hi

this is on -private on purpose so that

a.) someone can't claim I am doing slander and want to lower his
   reputation, and
b.) we dont really need more public discussion about it, since we
   already had that some while ago, and its mostly an informational
   text now.

I finally did the [redacted] reject from NEW some days ago, based on
the "Hostile upstream" disucssion we had a while ago.

This also means that no new software from [victim] will ever
enter the Debian archive. The only software from him currently in the
archive ([redacted]) could stay (ie. it only affects NEW), but as both
packages are buggy/unmaintained they are bound for removals.

Of course this is a very drastic action and as such none to be taken
lightly. But we think it is acceptable in this situation, as the past
has shown there is a lot of very heated discussions ongoing, sometimes
downright to threats of law suits, and we fear that adding new software
From him to the archive will only add more of those.

       Hi!

 Yesterday, 20th of March, at five to midnight, we have released out
most straining and time consuming project ever. It's codename is Simon
AndrÃ© and we are pleased that it was (more or less) a smooth release
process with just a minor delay of three days - but the best don't
release on time but when it's ready.

 Given that the maintenance of the release is expected to require a fair
bit of attention I have to set myself into soft-VAC mode. I do not plan
to diasspear from my other tasks but it might mean that my responses
won't be as timely as people are used to.

Thanks for your attention, enjoy the nice spring weather!

Uploading is in the US. He can do that. His own packaging work.

He has access to ftp-master (shell or ftp upload doesnt matter, its

The final call over machine access is with DSA. Currently I know that
doing such a seperation is not the most loved option of them. As far as
I know it is also currently not planned, but I can not speak for DSA.
DAM certainly prefers not opening such a kind of class of Developers.

We do not intend this, as the lawyer wasn't all to optimistic about

I dont think we got an estimate, besides it will take years and most
probably start off by getting either Debian or (more likely, as legal

It's time to say goodbye. I don't want to say too much about it, except that I've been planning this for a
long time.

Participating in Debian has been great.

For personal reasons I will be revoking my GPG key. However, it is not compromised and the validity
of this mail can still be verified using my public key from current keyring packages.

My resignation means that the following three packages will need a new maintainer:
- debtree
- debmirror
- qcontrol (tbm?)

It also means the following tasks will need a successor:
- editor and release manager for the Installation Guide
- daily D-I builds for s390
- Dutch translator for website and various debconf/program translations

All mails I ever sent to d-private (and mails quoting them) shall remain private.

So long,
FJP

Regardless of religion, there is a proven danger in glorifying those who
commit suicide, it encourages others to do the same:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1732435/pdf/v057p00238.pdf
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19789643

Debian's close-knit culture, and the extent to which many DD's feel a
stronger affiliation to this group than any other, amplifies the danger
substantially. The need for validation and recognition from this group,
of this group, is stronger than any comparable organisation I can think
of. Dedicating a release to someone is the highest honour Debian can
offer, we should be extremely thoughtful about what incentives we are
creating when we do so.

As yourself this: if Frans had continued to give as generously of
himself through the release as he did in the past, would you have wanted
to celebrate that by dedicating the release to him? If not, what are you
celebrating in dedicating the release to him now?

We are all, rightly, shocked and saddened by the loss of a colleague.
None of us should judge Frans' choices: there are many valid reasons to
choose one's end. But we should be careful not to put others at risk.

Biella may be in a good position to comment on the real human dynamics

Hi

litte Ganneff, born 2. May, listening to "[redacted]" (sometimes,
I hope), while presenting his mother with the finest set of "You don't
want to have this type of labour"-36hours labour, completly ignoring
that a day earlier his mother would have been in labour during labour
day, showing that he has no sense of humor, just told me, backed with
the full weight of his 3780 grams and the fearful height of 54cm, that I
should use that magic *m* key[fn:1] and reject all of your approaches to
my time, and as such going into a kind of Vacation over the next few
days to weeks, though he left an option that it will be forever,
forbidding me to talk about the evil grin he had while issuing this
order (and yo, I haven't talked about it, so all is fine).

He also turned on a special-for-you-english-natives mode to let me write
extra long and slightly complicated sentences.

But to show his evil overlord graciousness, he allowed me to show you

(mind, this is -private).

Footnotes:

[fn:1] In daks process-new it means "Manual reject"

as the reason for payment in the transaction.

Countries and people are different. Not everyone has the same financial
situation and the same rate may appear too high or too low for some.
Therefore you can freely determine for yourself how much or how little
you can contribute, down to the minimum amount. There is no upper limit.
This amount will never be checked and all people will be treated the
same regardless of the amount of their contribution.

Some suggestions are:

240 EUR per year for everyone who has a good job
120 EUR per year for people who have stable living conditions
60 EUR per year as minimum amount

In case of problems or questions, please do not hesitate to contact

 fellowship@fsfeurope.org

Don't worry too much and keep a low profile. We have almost gotten they
postpone the contract signing tomorrow. that's a first step.
I'm serious abotu the low profile thing, they like blaming things on you

[sorry for the duplicated email if you receive it twice]

Hi,

This email is about the decision of the Qt/KDE team [1] of banning
JosÃ© Manuel Santamaria Lema, aka santa, from the team. This means removing
him from the pkg-kde alioth group and removing him from all the group
maintained packages.
After that there are only 4 packages maintained only by him, that are KDE
related and you can find plans at [2].
JosÃ© is also a DM [3], at the moment, he's only allowed to upload a single
package that as seen in [2] will go to the hands of the KDE team. The DD
who authorized him the rights for uploading this package is revoking them.
With this email, we are also asking FD/NM committee to remove him as DM.

First of all, none of us have any doubt of the technical skills of JosÃ©.
However, he has shown he doesn't know how to work inside a team,
... [ snip defamation ] ...

Hi,

I need to fix,
1. Shifting my home --> new home.
2. Fix health of my wife.
3. Fix myself to get enough motivation.

#3 is not issue, it pops up time to time. #2 is serious and needs urgent
attention and medical advices.

I'm also travelling from tonight till Friday.

So, please feel free to release!

To be kept private forever. Apart from #2, many people outside this list knows
about my this plan/travel.

I've resigned. Your resignation procedure says I must announce that
fact to this list. I've sent the requisite message to
keyring@rt.debian.org and orphaned my packages. Please notify me if
there is anything I've missed. Otherwise please do not respond.

Hi,

I'll be offline until the end of the month. I'll be planting a garden
with vegetable seeds... and more generally trying to take care of
myself and avoid burn-out while it's still possible.

Regarding the Wheezy release, I won't be able to do any further work
on #704754 ("release-notes: [wheezy] mention AppArmor support") that
the release-notes manager will deem required, so what's left to do in
this area will have to be done by someone else, if at all.

Other than that, my packages should be in good enough state for
Wheezy. In any case, most are team-maintained and I'm on the Low
Threshold NMU list.

Cheers,

Good luck in your new life schedule, A&A...things might change a bit
in the upcoming months..

You guys know I like stupid stats, so you won't be surprised to learn
that, so far, and unless I'm missing something, that makes two "2nd

Hi all,

This morning I've received the sad news that long-time Debian Developer, Ray Dassen, died last
weekend from a heart attack, just 40 years old.

Ray has been a Debian Developer for an incredible 19 years, joining our project in 1994, and continued
to be an active contributor just until recently.

Skimming that page, there's a few things that seem kind-of odd...

How do you have a guest account without an account name?

There are about 18 accounts listed as "Debian Maintainer, with guest
account" -- shouldn't most or all of them just be DDs already?

Daniel Baumann seems to be listed as a Debian Maintainer (having been
demoted from DD?), but not listed as having a guest account; but
"daniel@master" still seems to exist?

espy should possibly be in the removed rather than emiritus keyring? :(

Christian Kurz (shorty) should presumably be listed as an emeritus
developer. He sent a retirement mail to -private on 23 Dec 2005
apparently.
Stefan Gybas (sgybas) used to be a DD afaik; should he be marked as
emeritus/removed? I don't see a resignation mail.
Quentin Cregan (qc) used to have an account when VA Linux was a going
thing, I think; he shouldn't have a guest account anymore I would have
though...
Raul Miller (moth) used to be a DD, so should presumably also be
emeritus/removed?
Guy Maor (maor) likewise. Ian Murdock (imurdock), Herbert Xu

Eric Raymond (esr) was a DD for a while in relation to launching "open

Maybe that's the right description for ex-DD's who maintain accounts
on some of our machines; but it seems to me like a lot of the names I

To start with, I agree 100% on what Ana wrote.

You totally missed the point of Holger's email, but you took the
opportunity to once again reiterate your favourite arguments, looking
for flaws on what people who try to improve our communities say.

Your behaviour is a handbook example of privilege blindness, but that is
not too bad, we are a bunch of privileged people, and we all fail into
the trap of not realising our different privileges.

But the real problem is that you refuse to see that privilege, even when
people is pointing it at you. When they are telling you directly how
some situations are threatening or toxic for them and you reply with
anecdote that is completely irrelevant, and generally failing to
understand any of the issues that some people find central to their
continuity in the community.

You love to defend free speech exactly at the wrong moment. Many of us
would prefer to have a better CoC, and maximise free speech; but also,
many of us understand that sometimes, the well-being of our peers is
more important, and so we shut the fuck up, and leave the dialectic
discussion for a better time and place.

think that you would prefer to give them the chance to express freely
than to allow other members of the community feel safe and welcomed. And
so, you look like their ally. That is not something I am willing to

Yeah, you need to look again.

No, we are not discriminating against men, get a reality check. Go read
the thousands of books and articles on the subject. Understand a bit
about the experiences of minorities, specially about women in STEM, read
what happened with GamerGate, and you will understand.

And the fact that you think that having an event that tries to help
improve the gender balance in the project is something to resign about,
talks loads about this.

The "press team" is basically me, and has been for a while. Fortunately,
our great publicity team manages quite a bit of the outgoing messaging.

I'm very aware of Sam, and the exact nature of his level of journalism.
I've taken each request as it came and advised accordingly. In fact,
there have been times that I have advised that quotes should not come
from an individual[0] but a spokesperson due to the possibility of this
creating future problems.

> If a journalist has a history of unpleasant attack pieces, that should
> definitely make us less willing to provide with them access and
> material.

Personally, I find Sam deeply unpleasant, but in my press capacity, he
has been courteous to deal with, and seems to offer generally good press
/when talking about the project/, rather than individuals[1][2].

That's all slightly irrelevant though. Let us assume that he is hostile
to the project. The only real remedy we have to this is to threaten to
cut off access to the project, and hence deprive him/itwire of news.
(Note, I've seen this done in non-Debian contexts).
However, due to the nature of Debian, this probably won't affect him
much. He'll still be able to access debian-news, debian-announce, d-d-a
et al, and write whatever he wants. What it would do is to cut off any
chance for us to comment on the pieces, and try and influence them.

Instead, I have in the past, and continue to, advocate caution when
dealing with journalists (Sam isn't the only one) who are potentially
less than friendly. There's various strategies for this, but to find out
the secrets of media manipulation, you'll have to join the press
team.[3]

Now, I have been asked for an interview with Sam about my election, and
given the previous three DPLs all gave interviews with him, I currently
intend to submit answers to him, unless someone can come up with a good
reason why the _project_ (and when I speak as DPL, it is viewed as the
project) shouldn't respond.

Couple of comments. Background: I've been interviewed by Sam when I was DPL, and have had some
involvement with some of the linux.conf.au <http://linux.conf.au> related events having been on the
linux australia committee in the past.

First: Sam's definitely a journalist -- he writes for an online magazine, and that's all it takes. He
mightn't adhere to standards you think journalists should, but, well, I'm pretty sure no matter how low
your standards are there are plenty of journalists out there that don't meet them. Sam just seems
specially bad because he actually writes about things we know and care about.

Like many journalists, he likes to write about conflict and controversy -- for whatever reason things are
more newsworthy and interesting when there's disagreement, preferably violent (hence the in depth
coverage of systemd...). And if there's no conflict around, he's not afraid to try to stir some up --
whether you call that asking the hard questions or just trolling. He's had a particular success with
Matthew Garrett on that score; I think it came to a bit of a head at LCA in 2010, where Matthew
presented Sam as an example of bad behaviour in his talk on open source communities, and Sam asked
the conference organisers for Matthew to be sanctioned, which they declined to do -- Sam's side of the
story is at [0], and I think it's fairly accurate as far as the facts of the matter went.

 From about that point on, Sam's been fairly hostile [1] but I (personally) wouldn't say unfair. I
generally lean towards the "all press is good press" view, though -- if people care enough to criticise, at
least that shows they care. If the criticism is hysterical and non-sensical, well, that's even better: if there
isn't any sensible criticism to make, things must be going pretty well! If you adopt that view, I think
Sam's relatively easy to deal with -- you still have to avoid saying something stupid, and you might get
asked questions you'd rather not deal with, but that's just what you should expect when dealing with a
journalist (even one with the highest standards).

A lot of journalists treat open source folks as friends, ie trying to be supportive and put things in their
best light. LWN and sjvn come to mind; Biella too really. You can balance being supportive and
objective okay, but I think it's fair to say it doesn't really give people the whole story -- imagine if
politicians of your least favourite party chose to only be interviewed by the friends, eg. If you try
dealing with Sam expecting him to be a friend rather than someone who'll quote you when you fall for
a gotcha! question, you're in for a bad time. Debian and Linux are important things, so they should be
held to that sort of scrutiny, to my mind.

So add that up, and Sam's done some negative stories about various things and holds a grudge on some
of them, and "some developers" hold a grudge right back. Even so, I think the whole "some developers
express quite a lot of hostility" is generally a bad approach to take -- it tends to provide the
embarrassing quotes that feed the "frequent topics of his hate" stories, and at best just provides a "did
not respond to requests for comment" that lets the writer draw whatever conclusions they like. There

are lots of wrong people on the Internet: help the ones who act like they want to helped; for the rest,
isn't their own error punishment enough? [2]

(I've no opinion as to whether DPL's should respond to interview requests from Sam. I don't think he's
got that much reach that his articles matter particularly much for Debian's success either way, and I
suspect that there are few enough requests for interviews from other places to make it much of a
burden)

it's useful to have an enemy to fight against. If so, I think there's probably better choices than Sam.

Howdy, -private,

What's Up
=========

I've started a new job! Hooray! It's a bit intense (lots of culture to
learn, writing stuff in a language I don't know, YOLO), so I'm going to
need a quick break.

Basically, NMU anything if it gets in the way. Docker-land and Go-land
is well covered by tianon (and sECuRE has been around a bit lately, yay
to that too)

My new Job
==========

I'm working as a "Digital Services Expert" in the USDS[1], a rag-tag
group of hackers thrown into the White House (mostly SWE/SRE) to deal
with the Healthcare.gov[2] situation, and ended up being so useful to
deal with shit like this, that the White House expanded the program.
There are about 40 of us (designers, UX, PD, SWE, SRE, etc) now, and
it's really rad.

I've signed up to hack on helping the VA[3] out with the appeals
process.

Anyone with more questions should totally email me :)

With love,
Paul

Hi,

I'll be in hospital for some surgery at short notice from 10th to
appoximately 12th of February. I'll probably have internet there, but
I don't expect to be very productive while in hospital.

I hope to be back in time for the Debian.ch AGM on 13th of February.

If not, Venty (most locals know him :-) already offered to be there to
open and close the CCCZH Hackerspace for the AGM.

Regards, Axel

Hi,

I'll be on holidays with the camper van in Scandinavia (Norway,
Sweden, Denmark) for most of July this year:

* departure around 4th of July (with some days of preparations before
 that)
* return around 30th of July (back in the office on 2nd of August as
 1st of August is a national holiday in Switzerland).

I will likely have mobile internet on most of the time, but since I'll
be behind the wheel most of the time, too, don't expect me to read (or
even answer) mails in time or to do much for Debian in that time.
Probably the best way to reach me there in time is on my Swiss mobile
phone (+41 79 7694554), e.g. by SMS.

Feel free to NMU where necessary (e.g. if I don't repsond within one
or two days to RC issues and there's no team(*) or co-maintainer
listed and responsive), but please also commit changes to the
according git repository where possible (most of my packages which are
not team-maintained are under collab-maint).

(*) The packages listed on
   https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=pkg-wml-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org
   are not really team-maintained. The "team" only consists of me
   nowadays. :-/

About our (Venty's and mine) travel plans:

Our main target is the southern 3rd of Norway, but we will be driving
through Denmark and the south-western part of Sweden, too -- either on
our way to Norway (i.e. during DebConf) or on the way back or both.

I'm happy about suggestions what places are interesting to visit (e.g.
Hackerspaces :-), which FLOSS events take place in July in
south-western Scandinavia, or where we can find people keen on
coke-signing and key-singing despite (or after) DebConf. ;-)

Our plans/ideas so far:

Denmark:
* RÃ¸mÃ¸
* HolbÃ¦k (in case Jonas is at home ;-)
* Kopenhagen

Sweden:
* VÃ¤nern / TrollhÃ¤ttan
* maybe Karlstad

Norway:
* Oslo + Drammen
* Haugesund
* Trollstiegen
* LÃ¦rdalstunnelen
* Ãlesund
* Trondheim

required ;-) and want to follow our journey, we very likely post
occasional updates on our travel podcast at https://penn.semmel.ch/.

And yes, no DebConf for me this year: The German government requires
electronic fingerprints to be included in passports nowadays (which I
refuse to give) and South Africa requires passports for Germansâ¦ (And
if I'd go to DebConf every year, there would be not much holiday time
left for visiting those areas I want to visit, too. :-)

The DAM is not providing input into the criminal process.

The DAM will be providing input into who is and is not a Debian Project Member.

A member who threatens the safety of others should be removed, if we
trust that it's an issue.

We have Debian project members who can substantiate these claims, and
do not feel safe.

Will we act to create a safe space for our members?

It's not about a badge, or DDs being "special" (spoiler: we're not),
or us giving some great honor by gracing him with our company, it's
about safety.

I am not comfortable with him around, in whatever form. I don't want
people like that in my community -- a community where my guard is
"down".

Illegal or not, even if he's productive or not (which I don't think he
is), his presence will result in contributors feeling less safe and
less able to do work they're spending their free time doing.

I should be clear: people like that refer to his inability to grow,
heal, and move forward from this, owning things he did wrong.

As others have noted, rape culture is real, but his inability to
understand consent and boundaries is troubling, and his refusal to own
up to it and fix it makes me feel unsafe.

I'd be a lot more open if he owned it, faced what he needs to, made
amends with those he's hurt, and tried to move past this by changing
his behavior.

Well the DPL has decided to go public about it after all.

In future I think it would be better to have a plan for these
things. To have an argument on this list about whether information
should be released while the DPL is sending it all to a journalist
isn't the way things should go.

Dear Editor in Chief of iTWire,

you may want to do something about this article by Sam Varghese on
Debian revoking membership of Jacop Appelbaum:
http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/open-source/73441-appelbaum-banned-from-debian-events-
after-sexual-misconduct-charges.html

While the first part is factually correct in its DPL quote, the article
ends with baseless hints of Debian and Tor having fallen victims to
manipulations by GCHQ psyops.

I consider that to be psycological violence[1] against the various well
known people who came out to report abuse, and I wish that news coverage
about this situation could rather contribute to creating a community
that encourages victims of abuse to speak up.

Quoting the DPL again, "In reaching their decision, the Debian Account
Managers took into account the public disclosures from members of the
Tor project and others, and first-hand accounts from members of the
Debian community."

We are not talking about vague rumors spread by a couple of
infiltrators, we are talking about first-person accounts provided by
well known and respected members of both communities, with a track
record of contributions of many years.

These people who had the guts to speak up deserve credit and respect,
and the article published on your site gives them none.

Hoi zaemme.

Mit grosser BestÃ¼rzung und Trauer habe ich vom Tod unseres Freundes
Elias Diem erfahren.

Elias hatte am vergangenen Samstag einen tÃ¶dlichen Bergunfall in den
BÃ¼ndner Bergen.

Eigentlich wÃ¼rde am Donnerstag das nÃ¤chste Treffen anstehen. Ich wÃ¼rde
es allerdings gerne ausfallen lassen um der Trauer Raum zu geben.

In Zukunft bin ich gerne bereit die Treffen wieder zu organisieren. Wo
und wann es weitergeht, schreibe ich noch in einer separaten Mail.

...
Ich habe eine schlechte Nachricht mitzuteilen. Am Samstag Nachmittag war
Elias mit unserem gemeinsamen Freund Roman Willi auf einer Wanderung in
den BÃ¼ndner Bergen. Beim Abstieg hat Elias auf einem kleinen Abschnitt,
in der GrÃ¶ssenordung von 100 200 Meter, eine andere, kÃ¼rzere Route
gewÃ¤hlt als Roman. Es war keine besonders gefÃ¤hrliche Stelle. Steiler
Grashang und einige Felsen. Elias ist auf seinem Weg abgestÃ¼rzt. Als
Roman bei ihm angekommen war hat er ihn bewusstlos aber atmend
angetroffen. Da kein Handyempfang vorhanden war musste Roman auf dem
nahen Wanderweg zur nÃ¤chsten Alp rennen. Das hat ihn etwa eine viertel
Stunde gekostet. Die Rega wurde alarmiert. Mit dem Bauernsohn sind sie
zu zweit zurÃ¼ck zur Unfallstelle gespurtet.
Kurz darauf war auch die Rega vor Ort. Die Rega Ãrztin konnte leider nur
noch den Tod feststellen. Elias hatte eine schwere SchÃ¤delfraktur und
Hirnblutungen davongetragen. Er war mit Sicherheit sofort nach dem
Aufprall bewusstlos.

Der genauere Ort war der Abstieg vom Glegghorn auf die FlÃ¤scheralp.

I already read the past e-mails about Jacob on private and did not
reacted on them, with a good reason..
WHO from our Debian community knows the truth except of Jacob (and/or
the maybe involved persons)? If most persons from here knew him as a
good person, is this relevant for the justice? Or is it relevant if he
was a troll.. We can watch the people only before their had!
I do not know what "discussing" this topic here will help to get new
information, it will just end in coursing.
I want to follow the german law, which says "not guilty till proven
otherwise". You are also german and I think this is a good law. Please
follow it also on this list.

I don't think you should. I think you proved that you care a lot about Debian and its community and
you will remain a good judge.

If she is selected, this is going because of the quality of the proposition.

Hi all,

This is massively off-topic, but I want to share this with smart people
to hear their opinions. I would normally post in Planet, even for
personal stuff, but I don't want to share this publicly.

I posted the below privately on Facebook (yeah, I know):

:::

So I was thinking of writing a rant/dystopian nightmare about the state
of the world and the ability of border officials to request social media
identifiers and credentials. I am going to do that later, but then I was
thinking that it is about time I make sure all my posts are not
completely public (as those would show in a cursory look on your public
profile, even without surrendering credentials).

So I tried, and at first I panicked because it seemed the option had
disappeared from Facebook. But no, it is just awful UI design, shame on
you Facebook! So people, if you need that, it is here:
https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy&section=masher&view under
"Limit The Audience for Old Posts on Your Timeline".

Anyway, that was not the point. The point was that I suddenly
considered, that an account that is completely locked, would probably
incite stronger requests to hand over credentials. And if I decide to
wipe my computer and phone before travelling, -and change the passwords,
and mail them to a friend in a PGP encrypted file so I can later
retrieve directly from them when I have arrived safely at my
destination- would not that be putting me at a higher risk of some
awfully long detention?

Of course, normally I would not consider my content dangerous at all,
but in the US climate it seems that dissent is already penalised, people

are already being asked about political affiliations at the border. And
even if I am not their target demographic *yet*, this kind of thing
might bring more suspicion to me. I have to fly through there in my way
to Europe in a month, so I am getting worried.

Of course, my more paranoid friends will tell me that this danger has
always been there, and I should not even use facebook, as the NSA has
everything that I post or chat here (hey, deleting chat history is
important too, too bad facebook does not offer a way to do it easily!).
As I was saying, the NSA already has everything, so why the sudden worry?

Because the threat model has changed. Now it is not just the NSA spying
wholesale, keeping things that might be useful some day against you, but
that usually can't harm you if you live outside the US (and you are not
a big target). Now the border police just checks your social media
manually and decide right there if you are undesirable or not.

It can have real, immediate consequences for anybody that happens to be
checked by an arsehole on a bad mood day, or bent of punishing lefties.

This has always happened at some levels for some targets, but it
becoming mainstream is a completely different game. That reminds me of
the darkest hour of my home country, during a coup sponsored by the very
same US DoD.

It could be that even the NSA thinks this kind of shit is ridiculous for
non-targets, because otherwise, they could just have your SIGINT records
ready for perusal at the border, instead of doing the grunt work of
forcing you to surrender credentials and reading all your posts.

Am I going insane here?

Ironically, I am posting this on Facebook. One of the very few times I
post something that is longer than 3-4 lines outside of a private group.
I would normally put this in my public blog, and then share the links of
various social media sites. But as you might understand, today that does
not seem like a good idea: a friends-only post means the same usual NSA
snooping, nothing new. At least it will not show on Google searches of
my name.

Wow, I did not expect such a response to my late-night braindump. I am
glad to see that many other members of the project feel this is a real
issue. In particular, thanks to dkg for the excellent write-up.

I won't be responding to certain messages, because my words wouldn't be

I'm quite sure the GA will be happy if someone provided such a policy to
agree on. In the mean time, I do think it's sensible for those having a
potential conflict of interest to declare it.

Shane already did so, and for myself, I'm still a member of the board for
Morus konsult AB, a (now largerly dormant) company I helped setup a few
years ago, and which does consulting on free software. It typically does
not lead to any conflict of interest situations so far.

[The whole process about negotiations between the FSF and the FSFE
should be treated confidential, and I do not want to see anyone sharing
information about this process outside this group, without coordinating
this with me.]

Dear members,

During FOSDEM we had another meeting with the FSF about how to move
forward with their request to change our name. From the FSF's side it
there was John Sullivan and Henry Poole (an FSF board member) and from
our side Jonas and myself.

The suggested next steps are (if no disagreement from your side):

* We would publish a joint statement in the next weeks clarifying we are
 different organisations, we have some different approaches to issues,
 that people often confuse us, and that we together want to solve this
 confusion to work better for the future of software freedom. Our
 general council, Carlo Piana, will help on this to make sure there are
 no legal disadvantages for us for any further next steps.

* There will be a series of meetings between us in the next couple of
 months. The first one would be between John Sullivan and myself in
 early March. In the meeting I insisted that we will not talk about how
 we change our name, but that the meetings will be open minded about
 possible solutions how to work together in future, and that we do not
 from the beginning already exclude certain options. After a long back
 and forth it seems, they accepted this.

Legal Network, us not endorsing their endorsed GNU/Linux distributions
on the website, our Free Your Android campaign (no focus on Replicant).
We had several meetings before about that during the last years, and
they asked us to rename ourself so they are the only ones speaking as an
"Free Software Foundation".
After the last meeting about this in April 2017, we had a discussion and
decided to first ask this question before taking other steps (attached
you find the briefings from last year and the discussion we had then):

 Dear John,
  after our meeting in Barcelona we had a constructive discussion in the
 FSFE about your suggestions for a rebranding. It became clear that for
 the further discussion it would be crucial to get a reply on one of our
 previous questions:
  * How does a re-branding benefit Free Software at large?
  Would you be able to send us an answer by your board on this?
   The feedback was that we would rather like to see a stronger
 cooperation, and working closer together than a split. In the framework
 agreement it is written:
    We intend, in the future, after we have gained experience working
  together, to develop a system wherein these decisions are approved
   jointly by a specific list of several major FSFs.
  Now after 15 years, we believe we have the experience of doing that. It
 has not always been a pleasurable experience, but we now know what the
 current tensions and activities are. That is why we believe that now is
 a good time to negotiate what such a system for joint decision
 making would look like.

and put those potential next steps on hold until we get a reply and can
better evaluate the situation.

As written above, the meetings with John would now focus on finding good
solutions in an open minded way how to work together in future.

Best Regards,
Matthias

Subject: [Legal Team] leaving FSFE's legal team

hello all,

I have decided to leave FSFE's legal team after almost 12 years. This
was not an easy decision to make and it has actually been on my mind for
many many months.

My frustration with FSFE has been growing for the last number of years.
When the new leadership team came on board it was to be expected that
some things would change but unfortunately it was not the change I had
hoped for. While there are many things that have contributed to my
decision there are a few core issues that are central. I am going to
explain these and hope that FSFE's leadership will (finally) listen and
take action.

* Decreased engagement of the legal team

Where before the legal team would be consulted for its opinion prior to
decisions regarding the legal strategy of FSFE or other issues affecting
the legal team it now seems that the legal team is merely informed of
the decisions made by FSFE's management. This has had profound effects
on the motivation of the legal team. While before there used to be a
flurry of activity this is no longer the case, and there are very few
conversations about real legal issues or discussions about legal
questions, and so on.

* Decreased visibility in the outside world regarding legal issues and
policy, no vision and forgetting about core goals

In the years prior to current management there was quite a bit of work
being done to collaborate with Brussels and international business
communities. This seems to have completely fallen to the side. Instead
FSFE seems to focus much more on short term goals like campaigns, which
will create a bit of press for a short time before moving on to the next
campaign. While campaigns are good they are short term and have limited

value without long term follow up. This part is missing.

There is no long term vision ("what do we want to achieve with FSFE in
the next 5 years?"), there are no ties being forged in the political
arena (apart from fringe parties like the Pirate Party or the Green
Party, which contributes to being ignored by others), and core goals
seem to be forgotten. Instead of working towards strengthening free
software's position in Europe and shaping how free software is perceived
(both I would consider core goals) the focus has shifted to goals like
gender diversity. While these goals are worthy they seem to have
replaced (instead of augmented) FSFE's original objective and I don't
think this is the right way forward.

* No knowledge being institutionalized

Knowledge about people, events, and political sensitivities, etc. is not
institutionalized. Several times when talking to the president and legal
coordinator about topics I became aware that we had already discussed
these matters before. However the information was treated as new to the
other party. Looking through my notes and e-mail archives later, and
talking to other people on the legal team, I confirmed that these topics
had indeed been covered already (one example was NIPA from Korea).

Additionally, the executive team and staff seem to be unwilling to
learn about the people and organizations active in the field (who is
who, what are their goals and motivations, where is their place in the
hierarchy and so on), despite being nudged repeatedly to be aware and
engaged by several people including me. Without this information it is
very difficult to operate effectively.

* Bad organizational management

FSFE feels like it is reverting back to being run like a student union,
whereas in the past people tried to make it more professional. FSFE's
management makes very basic and unnecessary mistakes unworthy of an
organization trying to have global influence. This is hurting FSFE.
Even though this has been addressed a few times (by some, including
myself) nothing seems to be done to rectify these mistakes. A few cases
that I am aware of:

- everyone taking leave at the same time (post-FOSDEM), meaning the
office grinds to a halt

- stakeholders not being alerted to key people being absent

- e-mails from potential sponsors getting stuck in mailinglist queues
for a long time because everyone is on leave at the same time

- e-mails about legal cases (France) getting stuck in a mailinglist
queue for a long time because there is no monitoring

- virtual machines not up and running because of lack of monitoring

and so on. I do not want to discuss these cases individually, but what
is clear is that there is a pattern: the organizational infrastructure
is fragile, there are no fall backs in place and where they are in place
they are not working.

* No improvements/personal attacks

None of the issues mentioned above are new (and if they are, then QED)
and have been mentioned before. What I have noticed when issues are
mentioned is that either one of these three things happens:

- they fall on deaf ears

- they are acknowledged and then ignored

- FSFE gets very defensive, or launches personal attacks. The most
glaring case was when the vice-president recently came barging in and
arrogantly threw insults left and right without understanding any of the
background of the situation, and launched a vicious personal attack on
two of the previous legal coordinators.

All these things combined have tipped the scales and now the negative
far outweighs the positive (because there is very little positive left
in my opinion). I no longer feel that FSFE is the right place for me,
or that it is advancing free software in Europe (especially the legal
field) and it is better to focus my energy somewhere else where I can
have a more positive impact.

Have I been perfect myself? Of course I haven't and I am very aware of
where and when I screwed up. But the difference is that I try to learn
from it and prevent the mistakes from happening again.

As the next step I will unsubscribe from the mailing list (I will stay
on the legal network).

Good luck FSFE, as you will need it.

Yesterday I stumbled across the "weboob" package for the first time,
which includes a slew of binaries with names similar to the following:
â¦
* boobsize: Display various gauges status
* boobtracker: Search and download torrents
â¦
* flatboob: Look for a house
â¦
* wetboobs: Weather forecast search tool

I'm having flashbacks to 2004.

That was a rhetorical question and a statement.

To make it clear: From my point of view there is no issue at all with
neither the package name nor the program names included in it.

The fact that you discovered the package only now just shows that the
vast majority of people just don't care about funny package or program
names and don't feel offended, either. (And IMO Debian should just do
the same. And actually does that for about 8 years now. Why should
that suddenly change?)

Subject: transparency about the fellowship
Date: Mon, 9 Jul 2018 20:57:17 +0200
From: Daniel Pocock <daniel@pocock.pro>
To: FSFE Discussions <discussion@lists.fsfe.org>

Hi everybody,

In the blog about fellowship elections being cancelled[1], the
fellowship has been likened to a corporate donor.

A similar comparison was made in the invitation to the extraordinary
general assembly.

On the transparency page[2], there is a link to donor information[3]
where FSFE identifies the significant corporate donors, especially those
who contribute more than 10% of the budget.

The fellowship appears to contribute[4] about a third of the budget,
more than any other single donor. That was almost EUR 190,000 in 2016

A single fellow also made a bequest of EUR 150,000 to FSFE and they were
not identified publicly. Every corporate donor who contributes over 10%
is named publicly. Does anybody feel that the same transparency
principle should apply in cases such as bequests?

Corporate donors (whether they are publicly listed or private companies)
typically have to publish some information publicly, at a bare minimum,
we can see in which country they are domiciled and who their directors are.

I feel it is a good idea to publish more details about FSFE membership
and fellowship. In comparison, while at RMLL, I was at the session
about April where they announced that they have 4,000 members[5] and
clarified that these are all full members of the association with a
right to vote.

FSFE currently publishes[6] the names of all legal members (GA members),
there are 29. FSFE has not directly published statistics about the
fellowship though, although the page[7] about the last elections showed
there were 1,532 people eligible to vote.

There is a weekly report circulated in the team mailing list that gives
a membership breakdown by country. As fellowship representative, I feel
that the information in this report is quite important for the
fellowship at large. I also feel that it is important for other reasons:

- giving volunteers transparency, the same details that GA and team are
aware of

- being consistent with the availability of information about the
corporate donors (e.g. we can see where corporate donors are domiciled,
so it is important to know where the fellows are predominantly domiciled)

- as the "E" in FSFE is for Europe, I feel it is important to
demonstrate the extent to which FSFE is engaged in each European country

The dissemination of the fellowship statistics on the team mailing list
stopped shortly after the extraordinary general assembly. I notice that
the fellowship numbers had been increasing last year but in the last few
months it has been decreasing. Personally, I suspect that two factors
may be responsible:

- the renaming of "fellow" to "supporter", many of the email templates
and web pages only started using the new term in the last few months.
I personally feel this is a downgrade, as a fellow is by definition a
member of a fellowship while a supporter is a more external role. Other
people may have had the same feeling and quit.

- increasing awareness about the GA decision[8] in October to begin the
process of abolishing elections

There is also a report circulated each week about mailing list
subscriptions. I notice in this report that there is a strong
correlation between the number of fellows in each country and the number
of mailing list users in each country. The blog[1] about removing the
elections asserts that fellows are a "purely financial contributor" but
if they are active in the mailing list and volunteering, I feel that
statement does not adequately describe the fellowship and it is even
more critical to have details on the transparency page and to ensure the
GA meeting in October puts in place a new procedure for community

Correction: We recieved a large sum out of an inheritance where the
deceased explicitly wished to remain anonymous. We never claimed that
this person was a Fellow, and to keep anonymity of the person intact, I
will also not make any statement about whether or not the deceased was a
Fellow.

We clarified this with "Initiative Transparente Zivilgesellschaft" whose
rules we follow regarding transparency, and they confirmed that it is ok
to follow the deceased's wish for anonymity.

Personally, I do not see a large risk of the deceased person trying to
influence FSFE's policy in future.

Huh? There hasn't been any change in this. The statistics is still sent
each Sunday on 4:00 by a cron job.

For others reading here: the statistics shows the number of supporters
by country and the development over the past months and years. It is
sent to the "core team" mailing list so that people coordinating an
activity can get feedback about the development of supporter numbers.

Maybe it's the discussion currently happening on some public mailing
lists which create the impression that FSFE is mainly busy with its own
internals rather than doing actual work. It is unfortunate that such an
impression comes up, because it does not match reality.

Subject:       application for FSFE e.V. membership and resignation
Date: Mon, 27 Aug 2018 12:19:39 +0100
From: Daniel Pocock <daniel@pocock.pro>
To:   Matthias Kirschner <mk@fsfe.org>
CC: FSFE Discussion <discussion@lists.fsfe.org>

Hi Matthias,

I am writing to you directly, with CC to the FSFE community, as this is the procedure for membership
described[1] in the constitution of FSFE e.V.

I understand that previous Fellowship representatives have written to you privately on this basis and
been granted FSFE e.V. membership beyond their two year term as a Fellowship representative.

FSFE e.V.'s recent decision to remove[2] the Fellowship and Fellowship elections from the constitution
creates a difficult situation for me. As a member of the Fellowship, elected by fellows, I have a
responsibility to the Fellowship. As long as two or more people consider themselves fellows, the
Fellowship still exists as an organization because that is the definition of a fellowship. Removing it
from the constitution doesn't make it go away.

FSFE e.V.'s meeting in 2017 recognized (item 15 in the minutes[3]) that contributors are not members
and despite a split of the GA, it was resolved to bring them in as members, yet nothing has been done
to implement this motion. The notice of meeting for 2018 (attached) suggests that out of 1,700 fellows,
only one person has been proposed for FSFE e.V. membership and I feel this makes a mockery of the
motion passed in 2017.

Last year's decision and the lack of effort to implement it further emphasises the fact that fellows and
volunteers are a separate group, not being members. You view us as a resource to be exploited rather
than equal participants.

As FSFE e.V. and the Fellowship are now separate bodies with no defined relationship, there is clearly
a conflict of interest for somebody elected by one organization (the Fellowship) to be a member of
another organization (FSFE e.V.). Therefore, I want to make it clear to everybody that where my
obligations to the Fellowship are not aligned with obligations to the residual members of FSFE e.V., I
will be putting my obligation to fellows first as that is the only responsible thing an elected
representative can do. Some members of FSFE e.V. have expressed resentment about this situation but
the fact is, fellows were promised representation and they need good representation now more than
ever.

For example, you previously wrote in a private GA discussion that my communications to fellows
should be censored to ensure that communications maximize donations (your comment in February:
"people might even stop to support us financially" if I write emails to the the people who I am
mandated to represent). But that is nonsense: the role of a representative is not to maximize donations,
my role is to ensure the money already given to you is being spent as well as possible. For trying to
fulfil that role, you immediately set up an illegal conspiracy to stab me in the back, publishing an
internal censorship policy for future communications and calling an extraordinary general meeting[4]
on a Saturday while I was out in Kosovo doing real free software activities and voting on a motion
tacked onto the end of the agenda to immediately terminate my membership without cause. It is never
nice to write such strong words, but in a case like this, fellows deserve to know the ugly truth about
FSFE Council's behaviour and as the elected representative I would be negligent if I didn't blow the lid
on this. As the #MeToo movement has demonstrated, sometimes it is necessary to call out obnoxious
behaviour to begin a process of reform.

People are asking how FSFE e.V. can raise[5] almost EUR 650,000 in one year and spend barely EUR
37,000 on producing merchandise. The public pages about financial transparency don't give enough
information to answer that.

With well over half of the funds now coming from the corporate sector and the two most senior staff
enjoying lengthy periods of paternity leave in 2018, people are also asking whether it is reasonable for
volunteers to contribute their time and personal funds at all. There are many organizations in the free
software world who we can contribute to and FSFE e.V. should not take us for granted.

Personally, I feel that my highest responsibility is to those who elected me and gave me a mandate and
I do not wish to be in a position that puts me above the rest of the wider FSFE community by accepting
a "regular" membership of FSFE e.V. if other members of the Fellowship and volunteers are excluded
from the same membership. In fact, I feel it would constitute an act of betrayal for someone elected to
represent the community to suddenly transition to being a member of an elite, unelected group before
their term as representative had even finished.

Membership is critical for all members of our community because that gives everybody the right to
attend the annual meeting, to propose motions for the agenda, to nominate for roles in council and to
hold council responsible to the whole community. In other words, membership is the only basis for
good governance.

The constitution empowers you to grant all fellows and volunteers membership in passing (provisional
membership) and forward them a copy of the invitation to the annual general meeting on 7 October
(attached). Therefore, I am requesting that you exercise that power today. I am also requesting that
you ensure all fellows and volunteers are provided (publicly) with full details about how they can

attend the meeting and nominate for positions in the FSFE council as this is vital for transparency. If
you do not accept this request, then at the end of my term as Fellowship representative I may defer any
future contributions of time or funds to FSFE e.V until such time as membership and good governance
is taken seriously.

As president, you are ultimately responsible for circulating the motion[4] to summarily and illegally
terminate my membership in May. Even though the motion did not pass, it has created a toxic situation
of mistrust between the Fellowship representative (myself) and other GA members. Not only was it an
extraordinarily unpleasant time for me personally to be the target of what was basically an act of abuse
and bullying coordinated by the FSFE executive, but it is an insult to all contributors that you consider
people to be disposable like this. As leader of an organization that relies heavily on the contribution of
volunteers, you simply can't treat people with such contempt and expect the organization around you to
be a healthy place. I am calling on you to resign now so that the annual meeting can vote on a new
president and put this horrible incident behind us.

Furthermore, as we both believe transparency is an important part of the free software philosophy, I
kindly request that you discuss this application for membership publicly through the main FSFE
community mailing list so all contributors to the organization can have their say.

Daniel

So where is the difference to a closed military court or gulag general?

I strongly encourage you to read about Gulags and understand for both mlitary tribunal and prison
camp, the result is often death. Debian can not kill you. Debian can't silence you.

Removing a blog from the planet maybe marginally reduces readers, but readers who are part of the
community. Debian can not rst connections to your blog. There is no speech being repressed.

You're a software engineer, living in very nice circumstances working with other people on a hobby
project together.

Get some perspective.

To all on this thread: stop marginalizing those who actually face death and life in prison for speaking
their mind. The comparison cheapens their life. Stand up for those who have fought for our rights by
not drawing such petty comparisons.

Debian is not able to do anything anyone would do to anyone in a gulag.

Please, all, get some perspective and stop with the comparisons to labor camps, targeted killings,
prisons and sentences of death. We sound like morons.

Ah, thanks for letting me know I am being publicly targeted in such a

One would think that the author of that blog post is completely clueless
of the world around them to think that transgender people could be
called the "privileged gender class", considering that transgender
people are disproportionally affected by poverty, systemic violence and
discrimination, and high suicide rates. But probably the only metric the
author considers is the ability to post in a Debian mailing list, "free
speech", and that kind of things you find in MRA/alt-right fora.

In any case, that post is just another example of somebody just "being
concerned", and "asking questions", trying to look polite and innocent.
But in reality this person is just continuing their vendetta against
people who dared to curtail their "free speech" to protect others from
hate and to make Debian a better community.

This thread is still about somebody with a similar history of
challenging every attempt at social justice now proudly displaying
transphobia in this ML and never apologising for it. And then the usual

Norbert, I am still trying to know if all the misgendering and
deadnaming you've done was another "error", or just part of the
character attack you were engaging in. Maybe we will never know, but as
the saying goes: if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck..

That's not what is going on here, clearly. They're attempting to sweep this under the rug, and hide it
from the majority of Fedora contributors, likely because the majority of Fedora contributors either don't
care about what has to be said, and have no objection to it being on Fedora Planet for that reason, or
because they would outright support this individual's blog being aggregated through Fedora Planet. It
should go without saying, but the FLOSS community strongly supports Freedom.

It's fine if I don't have a vote, I was just hoping it would.

I'm not sure if it's on topic, but, it's a fascinating tangent -- I had initially thought that the CoC wave
across the F/OSS world a few years back being pushed by activist groups was to prepare larger hubs of
activity for corporate acquisition, but, was unable to track it to a meaningful conclusion when I got
distracted by Red Hat's acquisition by IBM, Github's acquisition by Microsoft, Docker's acquisition by
Mirantis, NGINX's acquisition by F5, Rackspace's acquisition by Apollo, etc, etc, etc....

I'm now convinced that's not the case, because I just don't see any evidence of any coordinated,
collaborative buyouts of open source bastions.

I feel like I'm missing something, though.

Honestly, the CoC just hasn't come up.

I took FSFE to court. This is my story
Blog post from Galia Mancheva
Date: 20 December 2020
https://write.as/malinagalina/i-took-fsfe-to-court

Soon after the first lockdown in Berlin this year I filed a public case in the Berlin Tribunal of Labour
Court against the president of Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), Matthias Kirschner, for
workplace bullying.
Why? A female colleague and me had dared to discuss wage transparency and gender pay gap in the
office. Apparently it is common in Germany that this gap exceeds 20%, but we both felt secure that the
free software movement is progressive, and cares about being inclusive and equal opportunities
oriented.
Unfortunately we miscalculated â our boss Matthias was beyond furious.
After that office meeting, he told my colleague âthere will be consequencesâ. Our efforts coincided
with the resignation of Richard Stallman from the US-based sister organisation of FSFE due to careless
revictimisation of female victims of sexual abuse- another gender discrimination issue in our
community that would cause the situation in our office to deteriorate quickly.
In its reluctant press release on this pivotal change in leadership in the largest free software
organisation in the world, the FSFE had opted to honour Stallman for his undeniably long service and
overlook the social issues underlying the change â something with which I expressed dissatisfaction,
and not without support from colleagues.
It led to immediate retribution.
I was ordered to rewrite the text and was warned that I had âthree hours to do it. Whether we will
publish it or not, is going to be my [Matthias', my rem.] decision, not yoursâ. Free software is in most
of our digital infrastructure, and I care a lot about inclusivity in this community to ensure that our most
basic tools can be developed by everyone's perspectives for everyone's needs, so I rewrote our
announcement. But not only was it never published â it was not even honoured with his feedback.
My aforementioned female colleague, who had also backed me up, was fired just a few days later.
Personally, I was subjected to a good amount of pressure and strategic intrigues.
I was given tasks irrelevant to my job description and far below my qualifications. I was degraded both
as a professional and due to who I am through instructions such as âtranslate this [text] in your mother
tongue, so you can understand betterâ. I was belligerently micromanaged and questioned through
rebukes like âwhy do you refer to dates in this format and not in that formatâ, while there is no office
policy on following a particular date standard. I was even told some of the things I was working on
were bullshit! For 3 months I was pushing for time to launch a newsletter survey as an attempt to make
qualitative improvements, but my effort was labelled as ânot necessaryâ.
I was regularly nagged, and prevented from doing the work I was hired for. In front of my colleagues I
was tasked with one thing and in private I was asked not to do it and have it replaced with another, and
then in front of others asked about the progress on the previous. Matthias was manufacturing the false

impression I wasn't doing my work, while at the same time calling and texting my private phone
number in obscure hours (such as 5:00AM or 22:00PM) with work orders and topics. Unlike other
colleagues, I had a hard time receiving time off for the extra days I worked on, and was prevented from
taking any of my annual holidays.
I suspected Matthias was preparing to fire me, and indeed I was on a clock. He needed to make sure he
was re-elected FSFE president before he could get rid of me. It would have damaged his chances to
have fired all the full-time women in the office in the two months leading up to the elections â an
unnecessary risk â but once approved he would have another two years' free reign.
At this time my friends were starting to worry â the psychological pressure and lack of enough time off
caused my condition was decline. I had to take a sick leave. Certain that I was about to get fired, my
friends encouraged me to seek legal counsel, if so only to keep myself focussed on constructive tasks.
Immediately after my sick leave announcement, Matthias fired me over the phone on a Friday night,
and threatened me to immediately go to the office to hand over work-related items. Appearing in the
office during a sick leave is illegal in Germany, so I refused. A weekend of non-stop calls followed,
including from hidden phone numbers. He even texted telling me I should answer my phone, for my
own better. Even after my lawyer warned him to terminate all attempts to communicate with me and
send someone else to pick up my work laptop, he came in person to my house, and was very irritated
that I was not alone.
Eventually, of course, my sick leave ended, I was fired, and there was a global pandemic with follow-
on lockdowns.
It was against this background that I filed a complaint in the Anti-Discrimination Commission in
Germany and I filed a case against him in court for work-place bullying.
Disappointingly, it turned out, the Commission does not have much legal authority for actions, so I
proceeded further only with the bullying case.
During the process, one curious clue popped up. In one of the publicly available answers to the court he
argued I had no reason to doubt a gender pay gap, because you see, there was this male trainee that was
having a lower pay than me.
But, not only does the FSFE rate women salaries lower, but also foreigners. So, if you happen to be a
foreign woman â well, tough luck. At the same time they are proudly proclaiming the office
âinternationalâ and âinclusiveâ when pursuing donor relations or in relations to the public.
The court process was taxing. The FSFE lawyer made up easily disprovable slanders against me â and I
say âeasilyâ because their charges were demonstrably false, but of course finding evidence that is also
admissible in the conservative German court system did not do much good for my stress levels over
summer. They disrespected the court by not submitting papers on time, and they refused to answer my
allegations, opting instead to portray me as a disobedient, sexist, racist, incompetent belligerent. Why
did they give such a person a permanent contract after a six month probation period? Well,
magnanimously they apparently were afraid that I would otherwise be disappointed.
Now, I finally received the Labour court's verdict some days ago. The court basically says that even
though they recognise my claims as true I do not qualify for financial remuneration because I did not
suffer for at least a year and I did not end up having major psychological damage of my identity.

I was accused by the FSFE that my claim was driven by a desire for a quick financial gain.
Unfortunately, the German law foresees only monetary and no other type of compensation. However, I
was given the opportunity in court to ask for something else. I asked for an apology and the president
of the FSFE refused.
Why am I writing all this? Because I want to expose the hypocrisy and double standards in FSFE
leadership. How the organisation âpromotingâ transparency, equality and inclusivity treats employees
and more specifically women. How donations are spent on nurturing Matthias' grandiosity. Because,
let's be honest, to how many male employees' homes would he appear uninvited after being cautioned
by a lawyer not to do so?
I remain committed to open infrastructure and free software, and I know the community extends
beyond the FSFE Berlin office, where Matthias reigns supreme with the support of his FSFE Board
employees. I of course also hope that the advocacy arm of the European free software movement will
eventually also reflect the diversity, friendship and equality that I continue to find in the movement as
such. Finally, I want to thank those of my hacker friends who showed up in person at my final court
hearing and those whose priceless support remained in spite of physical distance. Your presence made
it so much more bearable, and reminded me that it is not the sour apples of the FSFE offices that make
our community, but the many people around them who continue to commit themselves and their skills
to a better tomorrow.
 Short correction to my story and a lesson not to rely too much on machine translation:
It was brought to my attention that my interpretation of the court ruling may have been optimistic. This
is due to relying on machine translation. I understood the verdict as agreeing with me on the facts, but
not on the rules. I feel it is my duty to clarify this mistake and I want to stress that it was never my
intention to mislead anyone. Whilst translations may be faulty, they are a small part of my story and my
story still stands.

Our message is "follow the guidelines we've set for behaviour towards
each other or you're not welcome to interact with other members of the
community"?! I'm... I'm truly shocked. That's just not the Debian I
signed up for.

And some of us who actually work on the project would really love to
have a place where the tired argument that is "being accused of
transphobia is an infringement on my freedom of expression" doesn't get
brought up with no clear explanation every single time a conversation
gets even a bit heated. I see no way that interferes with our goal of
creating a free operating system, but maybe you're right and that's just
a bit much of me to ask.

In any case, if your plan here is to publicly leave the project to avoid
"SJW Cancer"[1], can you please actually get around to doing that? I
wouldn't want you to have to go through the crushing experience of ever
having actually been subject to consequences. I know it can be really
hard for people for whom being on the receiving end is something they've
never had to go through and not something they constantly live with. (:

If I understand you correctly, you are arguing that because someone has
taken my private messages, without my consent, and posted them to a public
mailing list, *I* am worthy of reprimand with respect to conduct on public
mailing lists?

You asked "both sides" to de-escalate in the context of the Debian mailing
lists, when only one party had escalated anything on Debian mailing lists.

I am not defending my particular private messages as appropriate to post on
a Debian mailing list. I also did not post them to a Debian mailing list.
They would have been off-topic and noise and there is no reason to subject
the rest of the Debian community to such a distraction.

Banning this person, who is not a member of the Debian community in any way,
from our mailing lists, seems like a perfectly appropriate course of action;

and if this has been done, I appreciate the listmasters' action in this
regard. But it would have been perfectly applicable for the Community Team
to engage directly with the listmasters to achieve this effect, *instead of*
publicly calling for de-escalation from "both sides".

Debian's diversity statement commits us to be welcoming to all people
regardless of who they *are*.

It does *not* commit us to welcome all people into our community regardless
of the *idealogies they express*.

Nazis can fuck off.

I will reserve the right to tell nazis to fuck off, in private or in public
according to what I deem most appropriate and effective, up until the point
that the Debian Project kicks me out, or until it becomes clear to me that
the Debian Project is no longer worth defending against nazis.

If the Community Team thinks there is a list of words that are unacceptable
under any circumstances on Debian mailing lists, then they should publish
the list of those words for transparency. And they ought to work with the
listmasters to implement this as an automatic filter instead of a post-hoc
persecution of Debian project members based on content they have sent.

I do hope that it includes the phrase "freedom of speech", which has been
used to do much more harm to our community than "shit".

Subject: History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes
Date: Tue, 22 Feb 2022 12:29:53 -0500
From: Paul Tagliamonte <paultag@debian.org>

Hello, Debianites,

Allow me, if you will, to talk a bit about something that's been on my mind
a bit over the last handful of years in Debian. It's something that's pretty
widely circulated in particular circles, but I don't think I've seen it on
a Debian list before, so here's some words that I've decided to put together.

I've intentionally not drawn lines to the 'discussions' going on (or the
'discussions' in the past I could point to) to avoid getting dragged into more
thrash, so if you reply, please do try to keep this clear of any specific
argument that you feel this may or may not apply to. This is a more general
note that I think could use some thought from anyone who's interested.

During World War II, the OSS (Office of Strategic Services)[1] distributed a
manual[2] (the Simple Sabotage Field Manual), which was used to train
"citizen-saboteur" resistance fighters, some of whom were told, not to pick up
arms, but to confound the bureaucracy by tying it up with an unmanageable
tangle of "innocent" behavior.

While no one is working within the Debian community member attempting to
subvert us sent from the shady conglomerate of nonfree operating systems by
following this playbook, this playbook is an outstanding illustration of how
some innocent behavior can destroy the effectiveness of an organization. It's
effective, precisely *because* it's not overly malicious, and these behaviors
-- while harmful -- are explainable or innocent. Section (3) covers this in
detail.

Most of the OSS Simple Sabotage Field Manual covers things like breaking
equipment or destroying tanks, but section (11) is "General Interference with
Organizations and Production". I'm just going to focus here.

Let's take a look at section (11):

I won't go through each of these point-by-point since everyone reading this is
likely sharp enough to see how this relates to Debian (although I will point
out I find it particularly interesting to replace "patrotic" here with the
Debian-specific-patriotism -- Debianism? -- and re-read some of the more
heated threads)

I have a theory of large organizations I've been thinking a lot about that came
from conversations with a colleague, which is to think about an organization's
"metabolic overhead" -- i.e., the amount of energy that an organization
devotes to intra-organization communication. If you think about a car
manufacturing plant, the "metabolic overhead" is all the time spent on things

                                            Page 367 of 391

like paperwork, communication, planning. It's not possible (or desirable!) for
an organization to have 0% overhead, nor is it desirable (although this one *is*
possible) to spend 100% time on overhead. I think it *may* be possible to get
to above 100% overhead, if workplace contention spills out into drinks after
work.

All of the points in the OSS Simple Sabotage Manual are things designed to
increase the metabolic overhead of an organization, and to force organization
members to spend time *not* doing their core function (like making cars,
running trash pickup or ensuring the city has electricity), but rather, spend
their time litigating amongst themselves as the core function begins to
become harder and harder to maintain. This has the effect of degrading the
output/core function of an organization, without any specific cause
(like a power loss, etc).

I'd ask those who are reading this to consider how this relates to their time
spent in Debian. Is what you find something you're happy about with a hobby
project you're choosing to spend your free time on? Are you taking actions to
be a good participant?

To do a bit of grandstanding myself, do remember that it's not just your time
here -- when we spend significant resources litigating and playing bureaucracy
games, we spend others' time as well. People on the committees you refer matters
to, all project members in the case of a GR, all the Mailing List readers --
and that's all time that is taken from building and maintaining an operating
system. The output becomes degraded. There's no specific acute cause like
a buildd failure.

When I think about how Simple Sabotage works, I find myself unable to shake the
feeling that the best way to combat the organizational dysfunction outlined in
the OSS's Simple Sabotage Manual is to avoid "taking the bait", and to ensure
small, highly empowered teams of do-ers are able to execute. We need to avoid
being dragged into development by consensus -- while understanding that
communication and collaboration are good. We need to ensure that individuals
that continue to exhibit the behaviors contained within the Simple Sabotage
Manual understand the harm that can come from a system of individuals taking
actions like them -- even if their intent is sincere and come from a
constructive, helpful place. In some cases, ignoring the "sabotage"[3] outright

will work, in other cases, perhaps a gentile and respectful private note
letting them know that their suggestion is actively harmful and to consider not
doing it again. Engaging publicly makes things worse, since it will continue to
suck people's time into litigating the "sabotage" (which is, itself, becomes
"sabotage").

Taking an expensive action (like referring to a committee, re-opening an
old decision, arguing about the precising wording and associated pedantry,
and questioning the authority of those doing work) should only be done
if the cost outweighs the benefit.

We don't need to be hostile or expel people for doing things outlined in the
OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, since a lot of that behavior is -- at times --
desirable, but I think we do need a *LOT* of self-reflection (from *everyone*
who actively engages with Debian politics) to consider our actions, and
determine how (if at all) we feel that we (as individuals) should change.

Please don't beat eachother up with this calling each other saboteurs and
claiming that everyone's emails are "sabotage", but please do consider
using this mental framework when looking at our discussions from time to
time.

With love!

I was also very very surprised to hear we allow members removed
because of their toxic behavior still allowed to use project resources
to amplify the very things that got them removed in the first place.

No idea why we wouldn't have removed the blog of anyone expelled from
planet.d.o as part of that action. It seems wholly inappropriate to
keep any expelled member of Debian's blog on the planet.

will not be attending Debcamp/Debconf at all this year last week of July/first week of August as I am
tired of drama in the Debian community right now and sledge was being an asshole and banned me
from OFTC for a month like the transphobic pig he is, however will be attending as an online visitor at
GUADEC 2024 in mid-July and resume my engagement in GNOME after this will also participate
Online at Fedora's conference in the second week of August (but have no energy to fly to them on site
this year in the USA) will however help at the openSUSE conference in Germany in 1 week and go to
the guy in England in August, but 3-30th July I will be at home in Sweden and chill

DebConf25 Brest, France: Community governance and "curation"

# Community governance and curation

DO NOT PUT PEOPLEâS NAMES IN NOTES

AlmaLinux: âno drama, just Linuxâ.
https://www.sfscon.it/talks/building-a-no-drama-community/

* We are not AlmaLinux. We are Debian.
Some specific teams: specific responsibility. Some overarching roles

There's no one in charge of having "a vision" for membership in the project. Candidates are the "catch-
all" DPL (but there's a resources' & availability bottleneck), and DAM (which only has the "big
hammers").
People who cause trouble in Debian may not be bad people, instead needing support, but things can
spiral until they end up at DAM. Community Team is ONLY ADVISORY - there's a vacuum
Debian as a whole has (almost) no small hammers, nothing short of DAM (and maybe listmasters who
almost never intervene, except (apparently) CT sometimes request listmaster action and that generally
happens? We lack stats I think.)
[also Tech Committee can change the maintainer of a package] TC almost never does this. Has
happened once I think, in a super-extreme case (and that was immense drama) - TC isn't fixing
behaviour or community interaction in that.
[also owner@bugs can do stuff]
The above are all just "the persons in charge of the technical means theoretically might act if it happens
on their medium".
There is a feeling that all problems "fail upwards" to DAM +1 (who is then resource/availability
limited and only has big hammers)

Example: if somebody said âI was in Debian before CoC, so it does not apply to meâ. The current CoC
seems to be theoretical and not well versed into practical cases. Other communities have CoC with
experience in them. Refreshing the CoC is daunting because of all of the discussions that need to be
held.

We have some topics in Debian that are ânon discussableâ, from diversity to systemd because a few
people will raise the cost of that discussion effectively making it impossible.

It's an odd technical/social/cultural mix that makes up Debian and you have to accept that some of it is
not straightforward. It's correspondence chess mixed with some opinionated technical experts and some
deep cultural factors - quite a strange amalgam.
[Comment from a recent email: the nature of Debian is hard to quantify -amacater]

we have been advocating for Debian having a different and larger team to decide on expulsions, with a
lot
 - political capital and representation
 - with rotating members, so it doesn't get identified with people/heroes/scapegoats
 - with decisions communicated and sent by the team as a whole so that when people go nuts they hate
the team and not the members CTTE seems to work well in that respect

People have trouble to dissociate comments from personal attacks.
Moderation is hard work that is a source of burnout. How about widely democratizing "small
hammer" moderation (e.g. temporary list bans) to all DDs, like we democratize package uploads to all
uploading DDs?
*Individuals* having veto powers can lead to disaster in our community. (Also, moderation is pretty
invisible; nobody except $list moderators know "xx% of Foo Bar's posts have been dropped")

This is work that Discourse (and other forum systems) have worked on. Some stuff has been transposed
in the mailman3 world. Debian lists are a very special set of tools and there's a big activation energy to
do anything done to improve the tooling (and it'll be all custom). Maybe we can start to do stuff
elsewhere than on lists? Not something that DAM should be deciding.

Everyone can currently say "hey chill" - why do we not do this? (fear of repercussions?) It doesn't
work. Asking a nasty person to please not be nasty just encourages them. How would democratised
bans be any different? They actually prevent posting, rather than merely asking nicely. Yes,
repercussions/revenge/etc. become problems. Only in public - private invective is also an issue and still
unregulated. Yes, but one can do personal filtering. That doesn't work for public lists because the
discourse becomes dominated by the people no-one can stand... I would argue that making people

My suggestion does not fix all problems, but I think it would help. ack   â
protect themselves rather than having the community do it is another failure mode we have. I agree.
                                                                           âº

We're talking about a lot of technical solutions, how about looking at other groups of people who are
doing things together. Corporations, cooperatives, NGOs, ... Clearly we shouldn't move to a full top-
down orga, but there are a lot of processes that we can think of, e.g. exit interviews / disciplinary
processes, but also "onboarding processes", 360Â° feedback, peer reviews, etc.

DAM is able to issue âDAM warningsâ before the final hammer. Such warnings are visible/distributed
to other DDs. Nobody feels responsible to issue the warnings.

Warnings are sensible. But we need *some* way to give someone a 1-week mailing list ban and we
currently do not (practically listmaster has been able to do that (slightly longer bans) in the past, when
requested. but again it needs non-listmasters to give the impulse - it's mostly also too manual and
cumbersome to be used except in quite extreme cases). All current approaches in Debian are far too
heavyweight for such a small intervention.

Point maint IRL from the floor: some people are "too big" to be subject to discipline - due to
(perceived) technical contributions, irreplaceability. (Echos from Wikipedia; "but they write great
articles!")

We need to focus on supporting our fellow contributors as well as on disciplining people who act out;
both are necessary in different cases, but probably neither is enough on its own.

Comment: Support is vital: tolerance for personal failings is needed. Everyone has "crumple buttons" -
hit them and they crumple just as it you hit them in the stomach - do that, and they react anomalously.
Should we value people above the risk they pose? The outliers - the people we throw out of the project
- have sometimes been allowed to get away with it for a long time before expulsion. There have been
"figure skaters" for a long time - skating in and out of the rules - before getting kicked +1 - but there's a
lot of lesser misbehaviour that flares and then quiets down. And people must, perhaps, be allowed to
improve sometimes.

I would go for smaller âhammersâ at first. In many cases being âmutedâ (or moderated) for 24h is
enough for things to cool down.

There should be formal, transparent and efficient recourses against the risk of abuse of moderation
mechanisms +1 (appeal etc). privacy concerns should also be taken into account, to avoid generating
indelible public records about the behavior of people

\Comment: Do we build Debian from bubbles of good behaviour and good examples :) There's a huge
amount that falls on a few people who are widely respected and can settle things from experience - we
can all name three or four heroes but it *all* falls on them and we rely on them to pick it up all the
time.

âDiverseâ people might not want to join the community team because being afraid of being attacked
back on their diversity. [From a CT member: if you feel this way, come talk to me - we *need*
diversity]. As long as decisions are made public then the bad actor can stalk you so it seems hard. They
should come from teams and not individuals maybe.

Signing up for teams feels intimidating when you're worried you might be left holding the bag for 20
years - shorter shifts are more appealing. Maybe random selection, like juries?

We have maybe too many CoC - main CoC, mailing list CoC, Debconf CoC - I'd quite like to pull a
bunch of this together.

continuous shaping of the community (small nudges, more regularly, rather than big hammers)

The big obvious issue is that we're not designing a community from scratch, but trying to shape a quite
old existing community, with existing members (who also need to be on-board or â¦ elseâ¦ ).

How does the chess community handle difficult grand masters ? :)

How to do microfeedback without it turning into a pile-on

rate-limiting mailing lists? apparently doable in prac? could be [-1 but see AI suggestion below]

Maybe just have a rule that you can't post more than five messages a day - anyone who does gets rate
limited for two days or so ...

Maybe using some AI to detect potentially âproblematicâ messages / aggressive tone then having the
poster self-confirm the message after a mandatory cooldown delay (e.g. 1h)?

There is also an issue with self-censorship: some people are afraid to openly discuss some controversial
subjects on lists as they do not want (or do not want Debian, or their team) to appear in phoronix/lwn/...
summaries.

An issue you way to look at.

Test 7:

The highlighted files are not relevant for Debian, so you can safely add these
to 'debian/lrc.config' to then be ignored by 'lrc' from 'licensrecon'.

Leaving as 'moreinfo'.

Subject: Ending Debian contribution
Date: Sun, 17 Aug 2025 05:40:16 +0100
From: Phil Wyett <philip.wyett@kathenas.org>
Reply-To: philip.wyett@kathenas.org

Hi all,

After due consideration, I willing be backing away from Debian.

In my opinion I have been messed about for over a year, discriminated against by
one or more of the Debian Application Managers who overlooked my DD application
for over 7 months whilst moving forward with other applications that were made
after my own, one done in 10 days. I tried to get help and information using the
Community Team that next included the DPL. The DPL had conversation at DebConf
with the AMs present and I thank him for that.

My next communication was from the DAMs closing my application and stating I
could never apply again. The DPL has agreed with this decision.

I have also been told there is no appeals process.

I have tried to carry on with Debian contribution, but cannot.

Apologies to all for what I have supposedly done and what some feel makes me
ineligible to be a DD.

Regards

Phil
