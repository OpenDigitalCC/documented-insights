About Mozilla
Mozilla welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the European Commissionâs Call for Evidence
on the European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy.

Mozilla is a global community working together to build a better internet. For over 25 years, we
have championed an open, accessible internet where choice, interoperability, privacy and security
are fundamental rather than optional features. Mozilla is a family of open source projects,
companies, philanthropic projects, research labs and a venture fund that all sit under the Mozilla
umbrella. This diverse experience and leading technical expertise, combined with our non-profit
mission and the centrality of the browser and browser engine to the web, give us a unique vantage
point on the growth and evolution of digital ecosystems. Mozilla maintains the Firefox browser,
used by millions of Europeans as their window to the web. Firefox runs on Mozillaâs Gecko browser
engine, which is one of only three major browser engines left â alongside Googleâs Blink and
Appleâs WebKit â and that has put us at the heart of web development and standards for the last
two decades.

In line with its mission to sustain an open and accessible web, Mozilla is now aiming to bring more
openness to artificial intelligence (AI) as it increasingly becomes part of tools and technology
that people rely on each day â including the web. In March 2023, we invested $30m in Mozilla.ai,
an R&D lab creating tools to help developers tune open source large AI models so that they are
more reliable. Through the Mozilla Corporation, weâre integrating AI into our existing products to
ensure that users are offered choice and agency, and weâre investing in new AI-enabled products.
Backed by the Mozilla Foundation, Mozillaâs philanthropic arm, the Mozilla Data Collective is
rebuilding the AI data ecosystem with communities and what they want at its core. The platform
supports data that is properly licensed, clearly sourced, and offered by its creators on their terms
- whether that be for remuneration or fully open licensed - and everything in between. â

I. The Value of Open Source
Mozilla strongly believes that free and open software promotes the development of the internet
as a public resource. Europe is a hub of open source activity, and many developers and open
source projects are based in the EU. In many Member States, free or low-cost university education
allows students to contribute to open-source projects during their studies, rather than having to
prioritize parallel full-time work. This supports early engagement, skills development, and
long-term sustainability of open-source communities. This gives the EU an incredibly strong
foundation to build from to champion open source software and capitalize on its many benefits.

According to a European Commission study (2021), organizations in the EU invested about â¬1
billion in open-source software only in 2018, with an estimated impact on the European economy
of between â¬65 and â¬95 billion. The same study highlights that open source contributes
significantly to the EU's GDP. At Mozilla, we are strong believers that building in the open and
running a successful business are not contradictions, but that openness is a real differentiator
and potential driver of economic growth in Europe. The auditability of open source software
allows businesses to make informed decisions rather than having to trust the inscrutable
products of providers offering proprietary software. At the same time, commercialization should
not be the single goal of any policy initiative aimed at strengthening the open source ecosystem.
Many open source components serve as essential building blocks and infrastructure across the
entire tech stack, ensuring its security and integrity â often while being developed and
maintained by volunteer developers without being monetized. So while strengthening the
business opportunities available to the open source community is important, it is also crucial to
provide sufficient and sustainable funding to support open source projects as essential and
non-commercial digital infrastructure.

At the beginning of this EU mandate, we called for an updated EU Strategy on Open Source. We
welcome the European Commission's support over the past years in open-source projects and
software development. With its 2020-2023 Open Source Software Strategy, the EUâs executive
has shown its commitment to promoting the development of open-source software solutions, and
we commend the Commission for reviewing and renewing the strategy at this critical moment for
furthering European digital sovereignty, competitiveness and cybersecurity. We share the view of
the Commission that the open-source sector is of critical importance for achieving these goals,
and believe that embracing open source will help Europe build towards greater resilience in a
sustainable and equitable way that promotes the openness of the web.

Competition and contestability across the web and AI

Mozilla has long promoted a decentralized, open, and interoperable internet. Our story started in
1997 with Netscape Navigator, the original consumer browser and a popular browser of the 1990s.
In a historic move for competition, Netscape publicly released its new browser engine (called
"Gecko") under an open source license to enable others to verify, improve, and freely reuse its
source code in their own products. Although Netscape â faced with anticompetitive tactics from
Microsoft with its own browser, Internet Explorer â did not last after its acquisition by AOL, the
stewards of Gecko created the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation with a mission to preserve the open
internet and to continue working on open source browser technology. This resulted in the launch
of Firefox, which would soon bring Microsoftâs browser monopoly to an end. Sine then, others
have forked the Firefox codebase and used the Gecko browser engine to create new browsers
with different features. The most well known example is Tor, an anonymity browser frequently
used by journalists and human rights activists.

Given our history, we strongly believe that open source is a key driver of innovation, competition
and fair and contestable markets. Today, Gecko is one of only three major browser engines, and
the browser engine landscape is highly concentrated. When engine diversity declines, so does the

                                                                                                     2
practical ability to challenge dominant business models or introduce alternative, and better,
security and privacy solutions.

If control over browser engines were concentrated in the hands of a small number of vertically
integrated companies, especially those that also operate AI assistants, search engines, and
advertising businesses, policy improvements around competition, transparency, and user choice
would become significantly harder to achieve. Those companies would have both the ability and
incentive to optimize engine capabilities for their own services, limit interoperability for
third-party tools, or steer defaults in ways that route even more user data into their own
ecosystems. Maintaining an independent engine also lowers barriers for others. Smaller browser
developers that do not want to rely on Googleâs Chromium stack can build on Gecko, helping
sustain a more pluralistic and competitive browser ecosystem. Engine diversity at this
foundational layer ensures that innovation, including in AI-powered browsing experiences, is
shaped by multiple actors and multiple visionsârather than dictated by a single dominant
platform.

In the same way that competition among browser engines has enabled innovation across the web,
access to open source AI strengthens innovation, competition, and safety. The Linux Foundation, in
a 2025 study, has found 89% of organizations using AI already rely on open models. Open source
keeps costs down, supports interoperability, and gives SMEs and startups the freedom to
innovate without being at the mercy of platform decisions by a handful of companies. Without
open source, organizations' spending on AI deployments would be 3.5 times higher on average.
Most crucially, for startups building on top of open-sourced LLMs, they can scale without
structural dependencies and fear that their business models could be jeopardized by a change in
Terms of Service from a provider.

Open source also drives competition among developers. When companies must compete against
freely available alternatives, they face pressure to deliver better performance, lower prices, and
more flexible terms. This dynamic has played out repeatedly in software markets â open source
alternatives force proprietary vendors to improve offerings or lose market share. As AI market
concentration accelerates, with the rise of agentic AI systems posing new threats as existing
gatekeepers position themselves to control key access points for future innovation, enablers of
competition ,such as open sourc,e become even more important.

Sovereignty, resilience and security

For Mozilla, digital sovereignty is not about technological isolation or replacing one dependency
with another. It is about ensuring that Europe retains meaningful capacity to understand, shape,
deploy, and govern the digital infrastructure on which its economy, public services, and
democratic life increasingly depend. Open source software, independent browser engines, and
open AI ecosystems are essential enablers of that capacity.

At the infrastructure layer, diversity and openness reduce structural dependencies. When critical
digital functions are mediated by a small number of proprietary stacks controlled by a handful of
actors, the ability of policymakers, regulators, developers, and users to exercise real choice is
constrained in practice, regardless of formal regulatory powers. By contrast, open source
components allow public authorities, researchers, businesses, and civil society to inspect how
systems work. This creates verifiable trust: open source stacks can be audited, tested, and
scrutinized, rather than requiring blind trust in opaque systems. By allowing developers to pursue
forks that meet local needs, improve and build on the work of others, open source enables
interoperable, open source also invites interoperability and innovation. Thus, openness
strengthens technological capacity through pluralism rather than concentration.

Resilience follows directly from this diversity. Monocultures at foundational layers create
systemic risk: a single vulnerability, commercial failure, or unilateral change in terms can cascade
across entire ecosystems. A more pluralistic landscape of engines, libraries, and AI models

                                                                                                       3
enables faster collective response to incidents and supports continuity when individual suppliers
exit the market or change direction. For users and organizations, this also means operational
resilience and continuity: the ability to switch providers or products without losing functionality,
data, or security guarantees.

Security is also strengthened by openness, when paired with appropriate processes and
resources. Open source software is auditable by design: vulnerabilities can be discovered,
documented, and fixed by a broad community rather than only by a single vendor. Independent
browser engines and open AI models make it possible for researchers and regulators to examine
how data flows, how safeguards are implemented, and how new capabilities affect users. This
transparency enables evidence-based security assurance and accountability, rather than security
claims that cannot be independently verified. It is a prerequisite for credible oversight and
informed risk management.

As browsers become a primary interface for AI-powered functionality, sovereignty, resilience, and
security considerations become even more tightly coupled. Browser engines increasingly mediate
how AI systems access web content, how user data is exposed or protected, and how new
AI-driven capabilities are integrated into everyday workflows. If this layer is controlled by a few
vertically integrated companies that also operate their own AI assistants, cloud platforms, and
advertising businesses, dependencies risk becoming entrenched at exactly the point where future
digital value and control are concentrated. Sustaining independent, open engines and open AI
ecosystems therefore serves not only competition and user choice, but also customer control,
operational continuity, and long-term resilience in case dominant services are withdrawn or
materially changed.

II. Challenges Faced by the Open Source
Ecosystem
Despite the success and uptake of open-source software in Europe, many critical open-source
software projects lack sustainable funding and support. Funded research projects often fail to
gain critical momentum after the funding period has ended. We have heard from our community
that traditional funding models sometimes force open-source projects toward premature
commercialization, or force them to achieve sustainability through volunteer effort alone. Many
project maintainers essentially volunteer their time without compensation, alongside other
full-time roles. As mentioned above, commercialization is also not an appropriate goal or strategy
for every source project, and many critical open source components contribute to economic
growth indirectly without beckoning commercialization themselves. Both public financial and
community-driven support is therefore necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of open
source projects.

One area which would especially benefit from sustainable support is the participation of the open
source community in standard-setting bodies. Participating in the work of these bodies requires
significant time investment and expertise, prerequisites not easy to meet for many open source
projects and developers. However, the participation is crucial to ensure the representation of
public interest perspectives, as well as cross-regional harmonization to enable global
interoperability.

Besides the lack of stable funding for open source projects, and especially for maintaining critical
open source infrastructure, the European open source ecosystem continues to navigate a complex
regulatory landscape that often does not take the specific needs and challenges of open source
projects into account. This should not be construed as an ask for less regulation, but a serve as
reminder that regulatory requirements that are feasible to implement for large commercial
organizations often pose massive barriers for open source projects, especially those run and
maintained by volunteers. Where possible, lawmakers should scrutinize legislative initiatives in

                                                                                                       4
regard to their impact on the open source ecosystem and whether they risk creating new barriers
for open source projects.

Besides regulatory models designed with large commercial entities in mind, legal uncertainty is a
major obstacle for open source projects. In relation to open-source AI, research by McKinsey
shows that compliance uncertainty is a major barrier to open-source AI adoption. Looking at the
ongoing negotiations of the Digital Omnibus and the AI Omnibus, we want to highlight the need to
increase, rather than undermine, legal certainty. We recognize and agree with the European
Commissionâs motivation to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens and improve
predictability, especially for organizations trying to comply in good faith across the Digital Single
Market. But simplification must be judged by outcomes. Changes that reopen foundational
definitions, create new carve-outs, or weaken the enforceability of European law amount to
deregulation and risk producing the opposite of what the omnibus package intends: more legal
uncertainty, more fragmentation in practice, and more disputes about when the GDPR applies at
all.

Regulation can also play a critical role in leveling the playing field for the open source sector. The
EUâs competition tools have already proven essential to proponents of open-source adoption.
Mozillaâs early experiences with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) proves the positive impact of
regulatory intervention to ensure markets are fairer and contestable. Since the DMA gave users
the ability to more easily choose between browsers, Firefox has seen 100% growth in daily iOS
users across the EU, and high retention rates. The DMA has further potential to intervene to the
benefit of open-source software and open-source AI.

III. Policy Recommendations
To leverage the benefits of openness, strengthen the open source ecosystem and address
challenges faced by the community, the European Digital Ecosystem strategy should lay the
groundwork to implement the following recommendations.

   1.â Facilitate the public procurement of open source and open source AI solutions. This
       requires the adjustment of tendering processes and templates to better account for open
       source technologies and reduce administrative obstacles for open source vendors, rather
       than structurally favoring proprietary technology. The benefits of open source should be
       systematically considered with regard to independence, resilience, cost savings, and
       interoperability as part of the procurement process.
   2.â Prioritize the creation of an EU Sovereign Tech Fund to fund the development and
       maintenance of critical open source infrastructure and open source building blocks of
       strategic value. Allocate funding to incubate, develop, and maintain an open source AI
       stack.
   3.â Support the mainstreaming of open source requirements in research and innovation
       funding, e.g. through the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework of the European Union
       and appropriate funds such as the European Competitiveness Fund and Horizon Europe and
       its successors.
   4.â Facilitate the mainstreaming of open source requirements in public administrations and
       authorities. Support the development and maintenance of Open Source Program Offices in
       the public sector to advocate for the uptake of open source internally, and support
       developers and maintainers of open source projects in regard to navigating compliance
       needs.
   5.â Introduce an open source check to ensure that new legislative and non-legislative
       initiatives reflect the strategic value of open source and consider potential compliance
       and implementation challenges for open source projects.
   6.â Facilitate the consistent involvement of the open source community in relevant legislative
       and commitology processes, and mobilize funding and institutional support to enable open
       source developers and maintainers to engage in standards setting bodies.

                                                                                                         5
7.â Support Member States in identifying levers to grow open source talent, including through
    anchoring open source in STEM education, both formal and informal, creating safe
    pathways for migration, and enabling the cross border exchange of students, researchers
    and scientists.
8.â Consider accompanying the Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy with a dedicated open
    source AI strategy to support credibly open alternatives across the AI stack, thereby
    strengthening European competitiveness, reducing strategic dependencies, and investing
    into economic prosperity, security, resilience, and global influence.
