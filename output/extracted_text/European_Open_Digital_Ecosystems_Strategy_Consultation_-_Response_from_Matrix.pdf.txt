Introduction
We welcome the opportunity to participate in the call for evidence for the European Open Digital
Ecosystem Strategy.

The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C. is the not-for-profit organisation responsible for being the
neutral guardian of the Matrix open standard. Matrix is a protocol providing end-to-end
encrypted and decentralised real-time communications, and is widely adopted (in particular
amongst European public sector organisations) to provide sovereign, secure and interoperable
communication and collaboration solutions. These are most often used as alternatives to
proprietary applications like Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, Discord or Slack.

The main deliverable of the Foundation is the Matrix Specification, which defines the standard.
The evolution of the specification is controlled by an open governance model. Matrix also is an
open network of users and has a vibrant ecosystem of developers (both individual contributors
in their spare time and professional developers), vendors (integrators, hosters, product
developers) and users (individuals and professionals). This gives us a unique view into each
of these open source ecosystem playersâ needs and challenges.

As the adoption of Matrix grows amongst European public sector organisations, from national
governments (France, Germany, Sweden, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and
more), to local governments, universities and multiple organisations within the European bodies,
it is shaping up to become the standard for communication for the European Public Sector. This
position allows us to have a good understanding of what it takes to move an entire (yet
heterogene) industry from a closed system to an open standard.

Besides, this paper has been mainly written by Amandine Le Pape who also is COO of Element,
the leading Matrix vendor, giving her a strong understanding of the challenges of an open
source business trying to grow by competing with a proprietary giant. Amandine is also
the head of the Business and Impact section in the European Open Source Academy, giving her
unique insights and approaches to the problem.

Strengths and weaknesses of the European open
source sector
 The European open source ecosystem is very vibrant. The Open Source Impact Study
commissioned by the European Commission in 2021 demonstrates it well. It is also much more
fragmented and less funded than in places like the US, where BigTech companies provide
significant support.

It has always been strongly supported by the search for independence from non-European (and
in particular American) software, and a strong sense of the need to keep sovereignty over oneâs
data, and, as you are well aware, the geopolitical landscape is definitely accelerating this trend.
So we gratefully welcome initiatives, like this consultation, from the European Commission and
other European bodies to support this ecosystem.

However the European open source ecosystem is facing several challenges, some specific to
Europe, others intrinsic to open source.

Lack of recurring scalable funding
There are different reasons why open source software doesnât receive recurring funding. First,
organisations using and benefitting from free open source software (OSS) donât understand why
they should pay for something free (âwhy do you want me to pay for a license, the code is
openâ, sic), not seeing the value behind investing in its maintenance. For some, the fact that
OSS is free is even its key selling point.

This has ended up popularising open source business models centered around non-scalable
and not always recurring revenue like support or consulting.

Open source software is also often mainly (if not entirely) produced and maintained by a
community of voluntary developers, working on it in their free time and based across the world:
if there is a central organisation managing the project, it usually is too small to have a specific
governance or structure able to receive funds, let alone redistribute them equitably.

Some organisations try to support the open source project they rely on by funding the
development of a given feature or by contributing code, but without the subsequent funding or
developer contribution to maintain and evolve said feature, this mostly creates a new burden on
the project.

Grants, which usually focus on supporting the development of new features or innovation, have
also had little choice but be a one-off funding mechanism due to their structure, and the need for

 The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C. â¢ 14 Turnham Green Terrace Mews, London, England, W4 1QU
                    Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
clear deliverables in order to release the money. They provide vital support for projects to invest
and evolve, but the lack of followup is often an issue.

The consequences of this lack of recurring funding are multiple. First the project stays limited
by its current resources, which can be a problem if it is very popular. Popularity of an open
source project will drive more external contributions which need to be reviewed, merged and
supported, more feature requests, more bug fixes requests, and increase the pressure on
security. The looming security requirements of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) on
commercialised projects, might also be a deterrent for open source projects to seek commercial
opportunities for funding, effectively reducing their potential routes for innovation.

The lack of resources means that maintainers will have a hard time keeping up with security
maintenance, bug fixes and feature evolutions, and may lead to them burning out. This at best
makes it harder, if not impossible, to keep the software competitive against proprietary
alternatives, and at worst, ends up in worldwide security disasters.

The former is particularly true for OSS with an end-user facing interface: it is hard to build a
competitive product without funding to support a proper product and design team, which
is why so many open source alternatives have a subpar user experience, limiting their
adoption.

Tragedy of the commons
Whilst open source developers are interested in making the world a better place and
contributing value to the world, there will always be organisations trying to exploit it. Some
legitimately, others deliberately.

If the software is backed by a company, any organisation using the OSS to compete with the
team who builds it on its own market without supporting development will hurt the project. Even
if there is no harm meant. The upstream company will have a hard time competing on price with
other companies providing the same software without having to bear the cost of its
development, and will be forced to lock value behind proprietary walls in order to survive,
lowering the bar of free features available to the ecosystem.

Hurdles to set-up not-for-profit organisations to support the project
One of the recurring themes when talking to open source project contributors is that even if
they were getting funding, they wouldnât know how to receive it and how to distribute it.

 The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C. â¢ 14 Turnham Green Terrace Mews, London, England, W4 1QU
                    Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
Typically, these groups are formed of a lot of independent developers, all based in different
countries, mostly passionate about writing code, rather than the paperwork of setting up an
organisation, even if there is often an interest in governance. So setting up a proper legal entity
to receive and distribute funding usually comes with a lot of hurdles and questions:
    ââ Where should it be based? The country of the leaders are not always most appropriate
        nor not-for-profit friendly, and others may not be viable as they will require a local
        address.
    ââ How do I do it? It is hard and often costs money to figure out the best structure, write
        articles of association, define contribution models, prepare annual reports, etc.
    ââ Once I have it, how do I figure out how to redistribute the funds? Whilst there are
        different models which work out there (e.g. Wordpressâ 5% pledge, Drupalâs contribution
        credit system, Github sponsorsâ¦) it takes time and logistics to put it in place.

Fragmentation and lack of standardisation
One of Europeâs strengths is its diversity. But it really becomes a burden when it means it
cannot remove existing solutions because it is too busy focusing on internecine conflicts instead
of fighting the real enemy: the big closed monopolies.

Take the example of a very current topic: open source alternatives to Office365. How many
open source content management systems, file editing, email, calendaring, collaboration
providers exist in Europe? How many of them lock their user into their software and grow their
offering rather than collaborating or making it easy to switch to others for users to build their
best Office365 open source alternatives? And thatâs ignoring governments developing their own
suite and competing with the industry.

If we want open source to be successful in replacing proprietary alternatives, we need to
play as a team, not dilute our efforts by competing with one another, but by building one
big market where everyone can get their share and compete with the real opponents. And
we can do this by gathering around standards.

It does come with its own toll: getting a community to agree on a standard can be time
consuming, and a distraction from actually getting things done and improving oneâs software, in
particular when said standard is actually developed within a big slow moving body, like IETF.
This means that only big corporations can afford to participate and pay for the time spent and
the travels to different meetings. We need the courage and creativity to reconsider
standardisation processes in a way which is built for a fast paced innovation.

We need to support small open source organisations in their standardisation efforts if we want
open source to have a fighting chance against the proprietary monopolies. This requires a
two-pronged approach of both empowering open source organisations with the tools and

 The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C. â¢ 14 Turnham Green Terrace Mews, London, England, W4 1QU
                    Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
resources to engage with the standardisation process, whilst also breaking down these
processes into simpler and more accessible structures.

Lack of adoption by the private sector
Whilst most public sector organisations in Europe are at least recommending, if not mandating,
the use of open source, the open source industry canât really take off without adoption by the
private sector.

And whilst OSS is widely adopted by the private sector for some categories of software (e.g.
core libraries, infrastructure management tooling, and more generally developer facing
products), end-user facing applications are lagging behind.

There are several reasons for this.

First, BigTech is fully entrenched and has vendor-locked their users, making it extremely hard
to move away. Whilst regulatory packages such as the DMA have made some progress in
reducing bundling and other anti-competitive measures at the procurement stage, the reality is
that once a lock-in has happened it is very unlikely that a private company will have the
dedicated time and resources to move away.

Second, even if the incumbent provides a way out, the company doesnât have an incentive to do
so. Until now there was no real understanding by the private sector of the need for digital
sovereignty. Luckily, with the threat growing, this is slowly changing, but it will take time unless
we provide tools.

And eventually, open source projects and companies, when not lacking the product and
design nous to build appealing applications altogether thanks to a developer driven culture,
have to juggle between the community and the customerâs needs, both of which may be
trying to achieve different things. The community will be asking for features and user experience
they enjoy, when the open source company may have to focus on a given user profile to keep
the business afloat, targeting end users with different needs. And more importantly open source
businesses cannot compete with the funding behind proprietary companies, let alone
BigTech, when it comes to staff the product and design teams.

                    Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
The value of open source
Open source software and hardware have a much wider reach than just the technology itself.
They have an economic impact, a societal impact and an impact on businesses either building
on it or using it.

Economic impact
From an economic perspective, the study commissioned in 2021 by the European Commission
makes it clear, but here are few pointers:

First, open source supports economic growth. Indeed, contributing to open source is an
investment, and as the study points out, an increase of 10% in open source contributions in the
EU would generate between 0.4% and 0.6% additional GDP per year.

Then, open source increases competitiveness: with the core of the technology being a digital
common, businesses can focus on differentiation and bringing value while users are free from
vendor lock-in.

Additionally, open source enables innovation: by bringing more eyes to a problem one can more
easily unlock innovative solutions, as players with various backgrounds and experiences can
come with fresh approaches.

And eventually, open source can help create jobs. Again, as the study points out, a bigger and
more competitive market creates more jobs, e.g. an increase of 10% in open source
contributions in the EU would generate more than 600 additional ICT start-ups per year.

Societal impact
Open source is a key enabler for innovation and collaboration:
   ââ It enables startups & research by lowering costs.
   ââ It accelerates AI, science, and global collaboration, thanks to enabling scientific
      reproducibility as researchers can share code and data publicly.
   ââ It breaks geographic or corporate barriers as developers worldwide can contribute.
   ââ It democratises access to technology and development, which in turn brings creative
      solutions and innovation to R&D.

Open source is a cultural movement.
   ââ It promotes democracy of knowledge: anyone can learn from and contribute to the
      source code.

                    Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
   ââ It builds digital literacy and education: students can study real-world codebases.
   ââ It encourages transparency and trust, e.g. in security software, elections tech, or digital
      rights.
   ââ It brings accessibility (both in terms of impairment but also in terms of audience) as
      anyone can go and play with the software.

Business impact

Impact on businesses choosing to build on open source
Businesses choosing to build on open source will gain a lot of value from it.

   1.â Accelerate innovation
As explained above, open source reduces the costs of experimentation. It leverages the
community ideas and contribution to find technical solutions and innovate faster.

   2.â Cost savings
Open source foundations allow companies to share maintenance and quality assurance,
accelerate development and potentially time to market

    3.â Focus on differentiating value rather than reinventing the wheel
By participating in building the commodity in the open, embracing collaboration with the rest of
the community, will enable businesses to focus efforts on the differentiating value of their
products in the ecosystem.

    4.â Improved reputation and visibility
By being part of an open source community, a business will gain a new marketing channel and
bring visibility of their company and products to customers, investors and potential hires. In
particular if they work towards removing vendor lock-in, making them even more attractive to
digital sovereignty conscious organisations.

     5.â Influence
Contributing to an open source project brings the opportunity to see oneâs product be accepted
as a standard. If the company gains a prominent position in a community it will give them
influence on its progress.

   6.â Higher code quality and developer satisfaction
More and more developers are looking for jobs which allow them to contribute to the greater
good, and this is precisely what open source contribution does. Besides, working in the open
keeps one honest on the quality of the code.

Impact on businesses choosing to use open source products
The first impact on businesses choosing to use open source products is digital sovereignty.
The scale of it depends on the chosen product but in any case, if you use open source software
it means you can customise it and run it anywhere you like. You are free to take control if
you wish to.

This automatically removes vendor lock-in, and even further, if the chosen software is part of a
bigger ecosystem and you may be able to choose from a panel of vendors, in particular if the
software uses a standard protocol, or the vendor made it easy to migrate.

Open source also brings security by transparency: because the software is open, you can
audit it, others may also already have audited it, you can trust it, unlike the black boxes of
proprietary software.

Open source should also bring the benefit of an entire community innovating, and each vendor
focusing on bringing value on their specialised part. Although this is more true in a context of
interoperable products.

And eventually, because it is a more competitive environment (thanks to the lack of vendor
lock-in), prices should be cheaper. However one needs to be careful about not letting the cheap
prices be at the expense of the project itself, and be conscious about making sure the upstream
is supported.

All in all, using open source products lowers a business risk, both from a security perspective
but also from a sovereignty one, although one needs to be careful about the amalgamation of
sovereignty and buying European as they are orthogonal. Open source solves the sovereignty
problem, which allows you to buy from any country because you know what is inside. If you
choose to buy European, it should be to support the local economy, not for sovereignty reasons,
as a proprietary European solution still vendor-locks you and still gives you a black-box you
have no choice but trust.

                    Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
Recommendations
We see two main axis in the measures and actions that can be taken at the EU level:
   1.â Measures around ensuring there are more recurring contributions made to open source
       software
   2.â Measures which will help open source software compete against proprietary solutions

   1.âMore recurring contributions
As explained above, with more recurring contributions, open source projects will have more
resources to spend on maintenance, security work, bug fixes and evolution of the product. This
will avoid community members burn-out and ensure the longevity and quality of the software.
These contributions could (and probably should) be both financial and human.

Public procurement: mandate upstream contributions and supporting the
industry
Whilst the public sector is a great consumer of open source software, the procurement of the
software and services around it often prioritises lowest prices, favouring companies freeriding
on the software, and hurting those who actually invest in it and support it, thus bearing higher
costs.

A concrete measure would be to educate procurement professionals and ensure that any
purchase of open source software mandates the support of the upstream project. The
Open Source Business Alliance published last year a very relevant set of guidelines which gives
concrete context and ideas on how this could be done, namely:
   1.â Require a relationship with the Software Manufacturer / Community
   2.â Ensure Upstream Publication of Modifications
   3.â Ensure High-Quality Level 3 Support
   4.â Secure the Supply Chain Through Support for Core Components

One could add to that the idea of giving penalties for organisations not contributing upstream
when procuring open source software.

The public sector should also lead by example and should be encouraged to procure from the
industry rather than build in-house.

                    Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
Promote frameworks providing a Sovereignty-check to prevent
âsovereignty-washingâ
Be it for the public or private sector, as digital sovereignty becomes a priority we see a lot of
organisations jumping on the bandwagon and claiming to be âdigitally sovereignâ, when their
solutions are entirely vendor-locked and sometimes not even under a European legal regime.

To avoid this we should build and promote templates for procurement frameworks or
questionnaires that can be reused by organisations who want to have a real
understanding of the level of digital sovereignty a supplier is bringing. A first example of it
was used in the recent Sovereign Cloud tender from the European Commission, where they
âtranslated digital sovereignty into objective, measurable procurement criteria, showing a
practical way forwardâ (source).

Mandate Contributions for Profitable Organisations
Whilst in an ideal world everyone using the OSS would contribute back, the fact it gives a free
platform for the world to innovate is core to its raison-dâÃªtre. However there is no reason why
very profitable organisations should not integrate at least some giving back to their development
costs, in particular if the open source software is core to their business. Another consideration is
that if all of the largely profitable companies contributed a little bit, the impact could be huge on
the open source ecosystem.

This could take the form of a requirement to contribute back if the organisation is
profitable, either as direct line contribution, or a tax getting into a larger pot to be redistributed.
A direct line contribution would have the advantages of:
    1.â Less likely to be played by the bigger open source organisations and benefit even the
        smaller projects the original organisation uses.
    2.â Allowing the organisations to tailor their contribution so it reaches in priority the projects
        which make a real impact for them.

Another approach could be hybrid: private organisations contribute to a European instance
set-up specifically to receive the funds and intentions, and redistribute to the target
projects. Organisations would send the instance the amount of the contribution and projects
they are targeting, and open source projects can get all donations at once. Both organisations
and projects would only have one single entity to deal with. Examples of existing organisations
providing this sort of services include Open Collective and Copie Publique.

It is worth noting that financial contributions are not always the best solutions for open
source projects, as they may not have the structure, or be able to scale the number of
developers working on it, and in some cases providing expert developers who can grow

  The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C. â¢ 14 Turnham Green Terrace Mews, London, England, W4 1QU
                     Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
their expertise and become proper maintainers of the project (as opposed to one-off feature
contributors) might be a better way.

Set-up an EU-STF
The set-up of an European Sovereign Tech Fund could be one way to support the longevity of
the ecosystem, in particular as more sustainable practices like procurement changes or
potential taxes, get deployed widely.

Open Forum Europeâs report provides a good starting point for the reflection around it.

The key items from an industry perspective being to ensure it can support the recurring needs,
not just one-off projects. Open Tech Fundâs FOSS Sustainability Fund might be something to get
inspiration from.

It is important to note that existing lines of funding like NGI are still key to the ecosystem
and should be maintained: they support projects at a very early stage and fund some very
specific projects which are always helpful. They are just not appropriate as a long term recurring
funding mechanism and should be complemented with something more relevant.

Support open source projects in setting up a legal and financial structure
It is extremely complicated for very small (yet often critical) open source projects run by
volunteers to figure out how to set-up an organisation to receive funds, let alone redistribute
them amongst their contributors. The problem may be with the lead of the project who is not
comfortable with dealing with operational matters, or the fact the project is mainly based in a
country which doesnât have an easy way to do so. And eventually, if funds make it to the project,
setting up a governance structure on how to redistribute them equally amongst volunteers is not
trivial, although some projects do it well, and may create friction.

Finding a way to support projects in setting up the infrastructure to receive funds and the
governance to redistribute them amongst their contributors would be hugely beneficial for
them to be able to receive the contributions. The work of the Software Freedom Conservancy
may be interesting to look at.

                    Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
   2.âUnlock collaboration in the ecosystem to strengthen open
      source

Push for interoperability and open standards
If we donât want a widely used proprietary technology to become the standard, we have to
encourage open source companies to collaborate and bring a unified front around
interoperability and open standards. This could take several forms.

First it could be to financially support interoperability and open standards work in the
industry, for example by integrating specific lines for funding in existing funding mechanisms
(e.g. NGI).

This support could help create new open standards when they donât exist. For example, there
are a myriad of small independent players proposing one or more open source components that
can be alternatives to Microsoft Office365. The industry would benefit from a standard that
would allow the user to plug and play all these solutions to build their own custom Office365,
based on what they already have or their specific needs. But that requires open source players
to work together, build proof of concepts.

Similarly, existing open standards (like Matrix) could benefit from support to implement
certification or label programs, in order to drive adoption.

And eventually, when the standardisation level reaches the need to work within bodies like IETF
or W3C, it becomes a very expensive and time consuming work that small organisations cannot
afford, leaving the big proprietary players to take control.

So to summarise, the support towards interoperability and standardisation should help
new standards emerge, existing standards to grow, and help small organisations to
participate in standardisation efforts within standards bodies.

And last but not least, we should not give up on the existing regulatory work promoting
interoperability, like the Digital Market Act, ensuring there is enough budget for enforcement,
or a different structure giving it more fire power. Another angle would be to find ways to support
open source projects trying to implement the interoperability work.

Support open source user-facing products to improve their user experience
One key factor in the slow adoption of open source alternatives to proprietary user-facing
applications is the often subpar user experience and polish. There may be several reasons for
it, one being that often the development of these products are driven by developers which may

 The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C. â¢ 14 Turnham Green Terrace Mews, London, England, W4 1QU
                    Registered in England â¢ Registration number 11648710
not have the interest, or instincts, let alone training to get it right. But when an open source
product is driven by a commercial company, it usually comes down to budget and focus.

Budget because product and design resources are scarce and (especially good ones) very
expensive. Open source companies often are bootstrapped and running on a shoe-string to
keep the product secure, bug free and improving, whilst managing the communityâs
contributions; so hiring a proper product and design team doesnât necessarily make it to the top
of the list of investments.

And focus because the revenue making customers may not be the same audience as the open
source users, which may create conflict in product design when trying to drive revenue whilst
keeping the goodwill of the community, who often end up becoming paying customers. Element
is a great example of this, with the community expecting either a Discord or Signal replacement,
and the customers looking to replace Teams, and all these three applications having a very
different design and approaches.

All in all, we donât have a concrete recommendation on how to do it yet, but we believe it is
critical to find ways to support these organisations building user-facing products to do a
better job of the user experience. It could be via training, workshops, funding to hire product
or design, community workâ¦

Quantify the risk of lack of digital sovereignty for private sector
Whilst the threats of kill switch are concrete enough for top management to be aware and
understand the high-level risk, budget distribution in organisations is always a very competitive
process. Providing frameworks allowing the organisations to quantify said risk would
make it easier for them to prioritise the required transition of their infrastructure (at least
the critical parts of it) towards more secure and sovereign solutions, i.e. solutions based
on open standards and open source.

For example, in France, a Digital Resilience Index (Indice de Resilience NumÃ©rique or IRN,
available on Gitlab) was announced at the end of January. The IRN is a framework helping
organisations to measure their technological dependence at several levels of the organisation
(application, data, platform, infrastructure, competencies) and alongside different angles
(operations, technology, supply chain, data & AI, strategy, environment, security, economic and
legal). Itâs fairly new but has been created in collaboration with several big organisations to
ensure it would serve its purpose. The results of the analysis can help organisations prioritise
their investment to solve the most urgent issues (if any).

Conclusion
To summarise, whilst the EU open source sector is very dynamic and, in aggregate across all
countries, is at level with the US, it suffers from a different set of weaknesses. In particular the
lack of recurring funding and revenue limits its evolution and scalability. Part of it is due to the
belief that open source is free and overall lack of contribution back from organisations relying on
open source. There are also logistical issues making it hard for some projects to set-up the right
entity to actually receive financial contributions. Besides, the lack of interoperability and
standardisation creates a very fragmented market which dilutes its energy competing locally
rather than against the real threat. And eventually the lack of adoption by the private sector, due
to lack of understanding of the added value and often subpar usability of the open source
solution slows the growth of the ecosystem.

Open source and open standards positively impact the world across the board: from the
economy, to businesses and society at large.

Our recommendations are split across two main themes. First the need for more recurring
contributions to the projects, and second the need to unlock the collaboration within the open
source ecosystem and with the rest of the industry to increase the use of open source and open
standards, ultimately bringing more digital sovereignty and growth to the European economy.

The former can be achieved by mandating upstream contribution within public sector
procurement, promoting frameworks providing a âsovereignty-checkâ, mandating contributions
for profitable organisations, setting up an EU-STF, and supporting open source projects in
setting up legal structures and governance.

The latter can be achieved by pushing for interoperability and open standards, supporting
user-facing open source applications in their UX improvements, and providing tools for
organisations to quantify their technological dependence to ease investment prioritisation.
