Introduction

This document presents the contribution of the IoT & Embedded Systems Working
Group of the Digital Transformation Commission of the Catalan Engineering
Association to the European Commissionâs Call for Evidence on Open-Source Digital
Ecosystems. It reflects the collective perspective of professionals and experts
working at the intersection of industrial digitalization, embedded systems, and
connected infrastructures across Europe.

A distinctive strength of the European Union is its long-standing tradition of publicly
funded collaborative projects, which bring together companies, universities, research
centers, public administrations, and innovation hubs across Member States. Such an
approach can also help compensate for the lack of long-term continuity guarantees
often associated with proprietary solutions, which may become obsolete,
discontinued, or economically unsustainable if vendors change strategy or leave the
market. Open, publicly supported ecosystems instead allow communities,
companies, and public bodies to maintain, adapt, and evolve critical digital
infrastructures over time, ensuring technological autonomy, resilience, and sustained
value for European society and industry.
1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the EU open-source
sector? What are the main barriers that hamper (i) adoption and
maintenance of high-quality and secure open source; and (ii)
sustainable contributions?

Strengths
   ââ Strong collaborative culture and established frameworks for leveraging European
      public funding.
   ââ EU financial power.
   ââ Power of automation companies (Industry 4.0 producers and service providers)
â
Weaknesses
   ââ Risk of excessive bureaucracy.
   ââ Limited influence of European cloud and AI companies.
   ââ Open knowledge may be adopted freely outside the EU without reciprocation.

Obstacles to open source quality and security
   ââ Situations in which there are no open standards or a lack of implementation of these
      standards.
   ââ Lack of a critical mass of powerful European agents or corporations that promote it
      (small communities)

Obstacles to sustainable contributions
   ââ Difficulties of achieving a critical mass of agents that participate due to a lack of
      funding.

2. What is the added value of open source for the public and private sectors?
Concrete examples?

Public sector added value.

   ââ Ensuring the governance of critical systems prevents societal dependency and loss
      of sovereignty.

The private sector added value.

   ââ Open, collaborative service ecosystems foster trust and support minimum viable
      sovereignty.
Specific examples

   ââ Office software
          ââ Encourage the use of existing open-source software, such as LibreOffice, in
              public institutions.
          ââ Participate as the EU in the open-source project to ensure its continuity and
              maintenance, and to maintain an ecosystem of partners that offer services.â

   ââ AI models
         ââ Encourage shared data communities with initiatives such as Gaia-X
         ââ Promote AI models trained with the data from the previous point.â

   ââ Home Domotics and Care robotics
        ââ Massive domotics and robotics used by citizens should be open to ensure
           that their intentions are noble.

3. What concrete measures and actions can be taken at EU level?

   ââ Streamline bureaucracy and enable cross-cutting projects among companies,
      universities, individuals, and Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) by promoting
      collaborations across EU countries, without hindering local projects, since open
      results benefit the entire community.
   ââ Promote the use of open standards.
   ââ Help small companies with regulatory compliance.
   ââ Compensate for the lack of large corporations promoting open source by funding
      open-source projects with European funds.
   ââ At the same time, leverage open projects from any origin, while emphasizing those
      advancing European technological sovereignty.
   ââ Establish different levels of openness based on the EU's interests, ensuring that
      deliverables from open-source projects funded by the EU meet the minimum value
      set out in the bases of each call.

4. What technology areas should be prioritised and why?

The Human-Centric society (aka Society 5.0), which is based on Industry 4.0 (aka Fourth
Industrial Revolution), offers a perspective named 9+2 based on the 2015 Boston Consulting
Group Industry 4.0 nine transformative technologies (levers) plus the two emerging powerful
and transversal ones; Digital Twins and Artificial Intelligence, which are depicted as follows:
These 11 key technologies (levers) are prioritized because they are the main transformative
levers of Industry 4.0, and of Human-Centric society.

5. In what sectors could increased open source use boost competitiveness and cyber
resilience?

The potential impact, with the presence of IoT (Internet of Things), is particularly high in:

   ââ Smart manufacturing and industrial automation:â

           ââ Open and interoperable platforms allow manufacturers to flexibly combine
              equipment from multiple vendors, introduce new tools (e.g. AI-based quality
              control), and adapt production lines quickly.
           ââ Reduced integration and licensing costs improve competitiveness, while
              transparent, auditable systems enhance cybersecurity and safety.
           ââ Open-source-based digital twins, MES/SCADA components, and predictive
              maintenance tools can be shared and adapted across the EU.â

   ââ Energy (grids, smart systems, distributed resources):â

           ââ Open-source tools for grid management, demand response, and integration
              of renewables support more resilient and efficient energy systems.
           ââ Transparent code and open data models facilitate secure integration of
              distributed energy resources and cross-border energy markets.
      ââ Operators can more easily align with evolving EU cybersecurity and
         interoperability requirements.â

ââ Healthcare and medical IoT:â

      ââ Open, auditable embedded and IoT solutions (e.g. for monitoring, diagnostics,
         and hospital infrastructure) can improve security, interoperability, and patient
         safety.
      ââ They support cross-border health data exchange, telemedicine, and EU-wide
         initiatives, while reducing dependence on closed, proprietary ecosystems.
      ââ Open-source reference implementations can help smaller providers and
         Member States implement robust, compliant solutions faster.â

ââ Educationâ

      ââ Open-source systems can greatly improve the quality of education beyond
         generalized digital and systems thinking literacy, but high-quality,
         well-documented systems are needed.
      ââ They lower barriers to accessing resources and allow talent to emerge
         democratically.
