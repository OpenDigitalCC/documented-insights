## Purpose

This document discloses the use of AI assistance in the development of the Documented Insights consultation analysis system, detailing the respective roles of human oversight and AI contribution.

This is a research and development proof-of-concept project for laboratory use. No comprehensive security evaluation has been performed. Users assume all risks.

## Summary

Human Direction
: Stuart (Technical Consultant) - Architectural decisions, requirements specification, functional testing, and approval for R&D use

AI Assistance
: Claude (Anthropic) - Code implementation, documentation drafting, testing script generation, and technical problem-solving under human direction

Project Status
: Research and Development proof-of-concept for laboratory use only. No comprehensive security evaluation performed. Use at own risk.

- Knowledge of policy domains and stakeholder analysis
- Evaluation of report quality and usefulness
- Assessment of analytical output

### AI Responsibilities (Claude)

Implementation assistance:

- Perl script development based on specifications
- Python LLM integration code
- SQL schema implementation
- Makefile target creation
- Documentation drafting

Problem-solving:

- Debugging assistance
- Error resolution
- Code optimisation suggestions
- Best practice recommendations

Documentation:

- Technical documentation drafting
- User guide creation
- Installation instructions
- Code commenting

Testing:

- Validation script generation
- Test case development
- Edge case identification

## Development Process

### Typical Workflow

1. Human specifies requirements and desired functionality
2. AI proposes implementation approach
3. Human provides feedback and direction
4. AI implements code
5. Human tests basic functionality
6. AI refines based on issues found
7. Human approves for R&D use
8. AI generates documentation
9. Human reviews documentation

### Decision Authority

All decisions regarding the following were made by the human developer:

- System architecture
- Database design
- Processing algorithms
- Third-party integrations
- Deployment approach for laboratory use

AI provided implementation details and technical suggestions, but final decisions rested with the human.

## Components and Attribution

### Fully Human-Directed

Requirements specification
: All functional and non-functional requirements defined by Stuart

System design
: Overall architecture, data flows, and component interactions designed by Stuart

Domain configurations
: Policy domain definitions and keyword selections curated by Stuart

Validation criteria
: Test requirements and acceptance criteria defined by Stuart

### AI-Implemented Under Human Direction

Perl modules
: DomainConfig.pm, DomainQuery.pm, LLMPositionReport.pm - implemented by Claude based on Stuart's specifications

Processing scripts
: All numbered scripts (01-12) - written by Claude following Stuart's requirements and reviewed/tested by Stuart

SQL schema
: Database schema files - generated by Claude based on Stuart's data model, reviewed by Stuart

Makefile
: Build automation - created by Claude following Stuart's workflow requirements

Documentation
: README.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md - drafted by Claude following Stuart's content requirements and formatting guidelines, reviewed and approved by Stuart

Test suite
: test_system_end_to_end.sh - generated by Claude based on Stuart's validation requirements

### Collaborative Refinement

Report generation logic
: Initial implementation by Claude, refined through iterative feedback from Stuart testing with real data

LLM prompts
: Initial drafts by Claude, refined by Stuart based on output quality assessment

Error handling
: Patterns suggested by Claude, specific implementations directed by Stuart

Performance optimisation
: Issues identified by Stuart, solutions proposed by Claude, implementations validated by Stuart

## Code Quality Assurance

All code has been:

- Functionally tested by Stuart against real consultation data
- Validated through the automated test suite for basic correctness
- Verified to meet functional requirements for R&D purposes
- Approved for laboratory use

The validation test suite (`test_system_end_to_end.sh`) provides automated verification that 36 system components function correctly. All tests pass in the R&D environment.

No comprehensive security audit has been performed. This is research and development code intended for laboratory use only.

## Limitations and Considerations

### AI Limitations Acknowledged

Domain expertise
: Claude does not have domain expertise in EU policy analysis - all domain-specific decisions made by Stuart

Production context
: Claude does not understand production deployment requirements - this is R&D code for laboratory use

Security
: No comprehensive security evaluation performed by either human or AI

Data privacy
: No formal privacy impact assessment conducted

### Human Verification Performed

Functional testing
: Stuart verified that the system produces expected outputs

Basic validation
: Automated test suite confirms components function correctly

Integration testing
: Stuart verified components work together as intended

Output quality
: Stuart assessed whether analytical reports meet R&D requirements

### Not Performed

Security audit
: No comprehensive security review conducted

Code review for security vulnerabilities
: Not systematically performed

Penetration testing
: Not conducted

Compliance assessment
: No formal regulatory compliance review

Production readiness evaluation
: Not assessed for production deployment
